DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is cooled in a water–ice bath, and a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 35°C. Ammonium chloride solution is added in portions until addition produces no further exothermic reaction. The supernatant solution is decanted through glass wool onto 400 g of ice in a 4-L separatory funnel. The residual solids are washed with three portions of hexane, approximately 1000 mL total, and the washes are decanted into the separatory funnel. After the phases are separated, the aqueous phase is washed with an additional 500-mL portion of hexane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 500 mL of saturated ammonium chloride, and then with 500 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Most of the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator and the residual oil is distilled at reduced pressure using an ice–water-cooled fraction cutting head. After a small forerun, approximately 390–392 g (94% of theory) is collected as a colorless oil, bp 116°C at 1.6 mm (lit. 155°C at 17 mm).2 INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] temperature: a water–ice bath & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ammonium chloride solution & type: pure & concentration: saturated & note: aqueous &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: temperature below 35°C. & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: Ammonium chloride solution & type: pure & batch:each: in portions &  )  & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: hexane & type: pure & volume: 1000 mL & batch:each: three portions &  )  & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: hexane. & type: pure & volume: 500-mL & batch:each: portion &  )  & phase: aqueous phase & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: ammonium chloride & type: pure & volume: 500 mL & concentration: saturated &  ) & reagent:  ( name: brine. & type: pure & volume: 500 mL &  )  & [ dry ] reagent:  ( name: anhydrous magnesium sulfate & type: pure &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered. & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ distill ] pressure: at reduced pressure & [ yield ] appearance: a colorless oil & yield: 94% & mass(yield): 390–392 g &

At the end of this time 60 mL of water is added slowly to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 25°C to a volume of ca. 150 mL. The mixture is taken up in 160 mL of ether and washed successively with six 60-mL portions of water and one 60-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The resulting dark-brown oil is chromatographed through a 4-cm × 41-cm column of silica gel with eluting with hexane. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure at 25°C affords 10.5–11.5 g (80–88%) of 1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropene as a pale yellow oil.

DESCRIPTION: After six to seven hours, the temperature at the head of the column begins to rise above 95° and finally reaches 98°, at which point practically no more guaiacol passes over with the distillate. This requires about one hour more, after which the heating is stopped. The increase in weight of the absorption bottle amounts to 400–500 g.

DESCRIPTION: In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 1-meter fractionating column1 are placed 450 g. (7.5 moles) of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol, 212 g. (2 moles) of u.s.p. 85 per cent lactic acid, 1 l. of benzene, and 5 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is placed in an air bath on an electric hot plate and heated until the benzene-isopropyl alcohol-water ternary mixture distils at 66.5°. Distillation is continued slowly (six to seven hours) until the temperature at the head of the column rises to and persists at 71–72° (isopropyl alcohol-benzene binary mixture), and no further separation of water occurs. Ten grams of precipitated calcium carbonate is then added to the mixture, and distillation is continued until the temperature rises to 80° in order to remove most of the benzene and excess isopropyl alcohol and. The contents of the flask are then filtered into a modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. Cuts are taken to 60°, 60–75°, 75–80°, and 80–100° at 32 mm. The fraction boiling at 75–80°/32 mm. is isopropyl lactate and weighs 130–160 g. By redistilling the high and low fractions an additional 30–60 g. is obtained, bringing the total yield to 160–180 g. (60–68 per cent of the theoretical amount). The ester may be redistilled at atmospheric pressure (with some loss due to decomposition) at 166–168°.

DESCRIPTION: A 3-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer prepared from tantalum wire, a condenser arranged for distillation, and a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is heated on a steam cone, and a slow stream of nitrogen is introduced from a cylinder through a line connected to the top of the dropping funnel. To the flask are added 98.1 g. (1.50 g. atoms) of freshly sandpapered zinc foil which has been cut into narrow strips and rolled loosely, and 750 ml. of thiophene-free benzene previously dried over sodium. To dry the apparatus and contents, 175–200 ml. of benzene is slowly distilled with stirring. Heating is interrupted, and the condenser is quickly arranged for reflux. A U-tube just closed with mercury is attached to the top of the condenser, and nitrogen flow is adjusted so that it bubbles slowly through the mercury. The benzene is heated once again to reflux, and a solution of 64.1 g. (0.50 mole) of 2-ethylhexanal and 271.5 g. (1.50 moles) of ethyl α-bromopropionate (Caution!) in 500 ml. of dried benzene is placed in the dropping funnel. The first 50 ml. of the solution is added to the flask at once. Usually reaction begins immediately, as evidenced by darkening of the zinc surface and clouding of the solution, but in some cases as much as 15 minutes elapses before the start of reaction. When the reaction has started, the remainder of the aldehyde-bromo ester solution is added during 1 hour, with stirring, as the solution is maintained under reflux. After addition is complete the mixture is heated for an additional 2 hours under reflux, and then cooled to room temperature.

DESCRIPTION: A 1.0-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a septum cap is charged with a mixture of 67 g (0.80 mol) of sodium bicarbonate, 71.5 g (0.69 mol) of sodium bisulfite, and 200 mL of water. This mixture is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath to −20°C with vigorous stirring. Immediately the reaction mixture is added dropwise via cannula at a rate such that the temperature remains at −10°C. This addition takes 30–40 min. When approximately half of the reaction solution has been added, an additional 35.7 g (0.34 mol) of sodium bisulfite is added to the aqueous quench mixture. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 40 min at −10°C. The light-yellow mixture (pH 7) is extracted with three 500-mL portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 40°C at 70 mm. Final solvent removal with a vacuum pump gives a two-phase, oily mixture. The mixture is stirred with three 100-mL portions of hexane, and the hexane extracts are decanted and discarded. Removal of the final traces of solvent with a vacuum pump gives 16.1–22.8 g (44–62% yield based on chlorosulfonyl isocyanate) of a light-orange oil that slowly solidifies on standing at −20°C. The resulting solid melts at 34°C.

DESCRIPTION: A 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a 1.2- × 24-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column that is connected to a condenser, vacuum-take-off adapter, and fraction collector with three receiving flasks. The vacuum-take-off adapter is attached to a calcium chloride drying tube which is connected to a water aspirator, and the flask is charged with 35.2 g (28.6 mL, 0.40 mol) of pyruvic acid. The pyruvic acid is stirred at room temperature as 46.4 g (36.1 mL, 0.40 mol) of α,α-dichloromethyl methyl ether is added slowly over 30 min. Evolution of hydrogen chloride begins after a few minutes. When the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a glass stopper. The solution is stirred and heated at 50°C in an oil bath for 30 min while a few drops of methyl formate are collected as the first fraction. The condenser is then cooled to −30°C and the receiving flasks are cooled to −50°C with chilled acetone. The aspirator is turned on and the pressure is adjusted to 190 mm. With the oil bath at 50°C, a second fraction, bp 25–35°C (190 mm), is collected. As soon as the head temperature begins to drop, the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the temperature of the oil bath is raised slowly to 75°C. A third fraction, bp 35–40°C (120 mm), consisting mainly of pyruvoyl chloride is collected and. The second and third fractions are combined to give 33–41 g of a mixture of pyruvoyl chloride and methyl formate, which is redistilled through a 1.4- by 18-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The condenser and the receiving flasks are cooled to −5°C with chilled acetone. The first fraction, weighing 2.3–11.4 g and consisting mainly of methyl formate, is collected at 25–30°C (190 mm) with an oil bath temperature of 60°C. When the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the oil bath is maintained at 60°C, 18.6–21.2 g (44–50%) of pyruvoyl chloride, bp 43–45°C (120 mm), distills into the receiver as a light yellow liquid, nD20 1.4165 and.

DESCRIPTION: A 500 ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Trubore stirrer, a pressure-compensating dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser with drying tube. The flask is charged with 144 g. of triphenylphosphine (0.55 mole) and 125 ml. of acetonitrile and. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath and 88 g. of bromine is added dropwise over a period of 20–30 minutes. After the addition of the bromine is complete, the ice bath is removed and 72 g. (0.50 mole) of β-naphthol in 100 ml. of acetonitrile is added in one portion and the reaction mixture is heated to 60–70° for at least 30 minutes. The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, stirring is discontinued, and the acetonitrile is distilled under aspirator pressure until the oil bath temperature reaches 110°. After all the acetonitrile has been removed, the condenser is replaced by a short, large glass tube connected to a 500-ml. flask half-filled with water, and the oil bath is replaced by a Wood's metal bath. The bath temperature is now raised to 200–220° and kept at this temperature until all the solid has melted. The mixture is stirred and the bath temperature is raised to 340° and held at this temperature until evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases (approximately 20–30 minutes). The Wood's metal bath is removed and the reaction mixture is cooled to approximately 100° and then poured into a 1-l. beaker and cooled to room temperature. Pentane (300 ml.) is added and the solid is broken into a fine precipitate. The solid is filtered by suction and washed thoroughly with two 300-ml. portions of pentane. The pentane filtrates are combined, washed with 200 ml. of 20% sodium hydroxide, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The pentane extract is then passed through a 25 mm. diameter column filled to 35 cm. in depth with alumina; distillation of the pentane at reduced pressure gives 72–81 g. (70–78%) of 2-bromonaphthalene, a white solid melting at 45–50° (reported:2 55–56.4°),.

DESCRIPTION: The acid chloride, 12.7 g, is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and transferred to a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (12.5 g, 0.140 mol) dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the cold solution over 15 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for 2 hr. The white precipitate is removed by filtration and the mother liquor is removed by rotary evaporation to afford 15.7 g of the amido alcohol. The amido alcohol is redissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane and added to a 300-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar. Thionyl chloride (24.5 g, 0.206 mol) is added dropwise and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C (ice-water bath) and to it is added slowly 50 mL of cold water followed by approximately 50 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide solution, which basifies the reaction mixture to approximately pH 11. Saturated sodium chloride solution (approximately 50 mL) is added and the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The lower phase (CH2Cl2 solution) is removed and set aside while the upper, aqueous phase is extracted once with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solution is then filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave crude 2-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (1). The latter is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 110°C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7–13.3 g (81–85%).

DESCRIPTION: A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a drying tube containing calcium chloride, is charged with 138 g. (131 ml., 1.00 mole) of resorcinol dimethyl ether and 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred, and a solution of 150 g. (1.06 moles) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in 100 ml. of dichloromethane is added with stirring at 15–20° over a 25-minute period. The amide N-sulfonyl chloride separates as a crystalline solid, and the mixture is stirred for an hour at room temperature. The resulting mixture is cooled to 10–12° and 154 g. (2.1 moles) of N,N-dimethylformamide is added over a period of 5 minutes. The cooling bath is removed and the temperature gradually rises to about 30°, then falls. After 1 hour the crystals dissolve and the reaction mixture is poured onto 200 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, dichloromethane (150 ml.) is added, the mixture is shaken, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of dichloromethane, and the organic phases are combined and washed with 100 ml. of water. The dichloromethane is removed by distillation, giving a white solid that is triturated with 250 ml. of cold water, recovered by filtration, and dried, yielding 155–157 g. (95–96%) of 2,4-dimethoxybenzonitrile, m.p. 91°. GC using a Chromosorb W column with 10% butadiene sulfone as the stationary phase indicates that the product has a purity of 98%.

DESCRIPTION: In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a very efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 500-cc. separatory funnel, are placed 445 g. (5.5 moles) of sodium thiocyanate and 1250 cc. of 90 per cent ethyl alcohol. The stirrer is started and the mixture is heated to boiling. Then 615 g. (5 moles) of isopropyl bromide (p. 359; Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 37) is added slowly during the course of one hour. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for six hours. At the end of this time the precipitated sodium bromide is removed by filtration and washed with 250 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. As much of the alcohol as possible is then removed by distillation on the steam bath. To the residue in the flask is added 500 cc. of water, and the upper layer of isopropyl thiocyanate is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are added to the crude thiocyanate, and the combined product is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried material is fractionated twice from a modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating column. The following fractions are collected: up to 60°; 60–100°; 100–130°; 130–146°; and 146–151°. The last fraction contains the pure product. The yield is 320–345 g. (63–68 per cent of the theoretical amount). By redistilling the alcohol that was removed on the steam bath through an efficient fractionating column until all the alcohol is removed, separating the water, and distilling, there is obtained an additional 55–65 g. of product boiling at 146–151°. The total yield is 385–400 g. (76–79 per cent of the theoretical amount). On redistillation of the combined fractions boiling at 146–151°, practically the entire amount distils at 149–151°.

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask provided with a mechanical stirrer are placed 75 g. (1 mole) of glycine (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 298) and 300 cc. of water. The mixture is stirred vigorously until the glycine is almost completely dissolved, when 215 g. (2 moles) of 95 per cent acetic anhydride is added in one portion. Vigorous stirring is continued for fifteen to twenty minutes, during which time the solution becomes hot and acetylglycine may begin to crystallize. The solution is placed in the refrigerator overnight to effect complete crystallization. The precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold water, and dried at 100–110°. This product weighs 75–85 g. and melts at 207–208°. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath at 50–60°. The residue on recrystallization from 75 cc. of boiling water yields a second fraction, of 20–30 g., which melts at 207–208° after being washed with ice-cold water and dried at 100–110°. An additional 4–6 g. of only slightly less pure product may be obtained from the mother liquor by concentration. The total yield is 104–108 g. (89–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: The dry barium salt is placed in a 2-l. flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, 600 cc. of water is added, and the mixture heated to boiling. The calculated quantity of 5 N sulfuric acid is introduced gradually from a separatory funnel into the well-stirred mixture over a period of about one hour. The mixture is then centrifuged or filtered with suction through a thin layer of fuller's earth. The barium sulfate precipitate is transferred to a beaker and extracted with two 250-cc. portions of boiling water. The filtrate and washings are transferred to a distilling flask placed in a water bath and concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 175–200 cc.. The syrupy residue is poured into a large beaker and treated with 500 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol. Crystals of the acid begin to appear at once. The mixture is allowed to stand for three or four hours in an ice bath to complete the precipitation, and the crystalline solid is separated by filtration with suction. After being washed with two 75-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, the product is dried at 100°. The methyliminodiacetic acid forms fine, white crystals, m.p. 215°, and weighs 92–105 g.

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 212 g. (1 mole) of benzoin, 110 g. (1.8 moles) of urea and 800 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask is heated under a reflux condenser for seven hours. The hot solution is quickly poured into a 2-l. beaker and allowed to stand at least three hours. The cold mixture is then transferred by means of a large wooden spoon or spatula to a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible with the help of a rubber dam. The crystals are pressed down during the suction filtration. The filtrate is discarded. The crystals are returned to the beaker, stirred mechanically with 500 cc. of ether for thirty minutes, filtered again by suction, and spread out to dry at least overnight. The product is dissolved by heating with 1 l. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser, and the clear solution is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2.5 l. of water in a 4-l. (1-gal.) crock. Stirring is continued for thirty minutes. The mixture is filtered on a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The crystals are transferred to the 2-l. beaker and stirred mechanically for ten minutes with 1 l. of water. After filtration, the washing with water is repeated. The product is then returned to the beaker, stirred with 750 cc. of ether, and filtered again. The material is then air-dried to constant weight.

DESCRIPTION: A solution of 57 g. (0.88 mole) of potassium cyanide in 570 ml. of water is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser. Fifty-eight grams (0.15 mole) of N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide2 is added and the mixture is heated to boiling with good stirring. As the mixture is brought to boiling, the solid goes into solution. Within a few minutes of the onset of boiling, evolution of trimethylamine begins and a steam-volatile oil starts to separate from the solution. The reaction mixture is boiled vigorously with stirring for 2 hours and then is allowed to cool to room temperature. During the cooling the oil that has separated solidifies.

DESCRIPTION: B. (R)-(+)-1,1,2-Triphenylethanediol. A solution of methyl (R)-(−)-mandelate (92.3 g, 0.556 mol) in ether (500 mL) is added dropwise to the cold solution of phenylmagnesium bromide prepared in Step A at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above 10°C (1.25 hr required). The mixture is then allowed to stir an additional 2 hr with cooling (final temp 6°C) before heating to reflux. After 3 hr at reflux the solution is allowed to stand overnight at ambient temperature under nitrogen. The solution (CAUTION: Contains benzene) is poured onto 1 kg of ice contained in a 5-L, round-bottomed flask placed in an ice bath and equipped with an overhead stirrer and reflux condenser. A solid mass results that is broken up with a spatula so that it is partly stirrable. Hydrochloric acid (6 N, 516 mL) is added dropwise, while monitoring the pH, to a pH of 3.9. The two-phase, liquid mixture is stirred for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) (3 × 250 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated to a thick caramel-like oil (179 g). Methanol (300 mL) is added causing crystallization and the mixture is heated to reflux to give a clear yellow solution. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature over several hours. It is then cooled in an ice bath to 0°C and aged for 1 hr. The product is collected on a filter and washed with cold (−10°C) methanol (200 mL). The solid is dried under reduced pressure at 50°C (106.6 g, 66%), mp 123–127°C, [α]20D +220° (95% ethanol, c 1). Liquid chromatographic (LC) analysis shows 96.6% purity with 3.2% benzoin contamination (area %, uncorrected for relative response).

DESCRIPTION: A. α-Bromophenylacetic acid. A 3-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser is charged with 750 ml. of benzene, 230 g. (1.69 moles) of phenylacetic acid, 15 g. (0.12 mole) of phosphorus trichloride and 288 g. (1.80 moles) of bromine. The resulting solution is heated at gentle reflux for 2–3 days until the initial bromine color is discharged. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and after 1 hour is decanted from some polymeric material into a 2-l. distilling flask. Removal of the solvent by distillation at water bath temperatures with the aid of a water aspirator gives a black oil which is poured into 250–300 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90–120°). The mixture is heated, dissolving the oil, and the solution is stored at −25° in a freezer for 12 hours. Filtration on a sintered-glass funnel followed by washing with 200 ml. of cold (10°) ligroin (b.p. 90–120°) gives 243 g. (67%) of α-bromophenylacetic acid as a white solid, m.p. 73–83°. Recrystallization from about 400 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90–120°) with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon affords 217–233 g. (60–62%) of the purified acid, m.p. 80.5–84°.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 250 mL of water, 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 49.5 g (0.65 mol) of cyclopropylcarbinol; the reaction mixture is refluxed for ca. 100 min. The formation of cyclobutanol can be observed nearly instantaneously, as this alcohol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel (using a three-way adapter, parallel sidearm), and the reflux condenser is replaced by an ethanol–dry ice trap connected to a U-tube immersed in an ethanol–dry ice bath to ensure condensation of the very volatile cyclobutanone. The flask is charged with an additional 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 mL of water and 440 g (3.5 mol) of oxalic acid dihydrate. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for ca. 15 min to saturate the solution with oxalic acid. A solution of 162 g (1.62 mol) of chromium trioxide in 250 mL of water is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 10°C and 15°C (NaCl–ice bath, −5°C to −10°C) and the generation of carbon dioxide remains gentle. The reduction of each drop of chromic acid is practically instantaneous. As the addition of the reagent proceeds (1.5–2 hr), oxalic acid gradually dissolves and a dark-blue solution containing chromium(III) salts results. Just before the end of the oxidation (ca. 10 mL of the chromic acid solution left), the cyclobutanone (with traces of cyclobutanol) trapped in the U-tube (a few milliliters) is added to the reaction mixture. After the oxidation is completed, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for ca. 1 hr to bring the reaction mixture to room temperature and to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution.

DESCRIPTION: In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a sealed mechanical stirrer are placed 54.0 g. (1.00 mole) of commercial, anhydrous sodium methoxide and 2 l. of anhydrous ether. The flask is purged with dry nitrogen and cooled in an ice bath. The inlet tube is replaced by an addition funnel containing a solution of 123 g. (1.10 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexanone and 81.4 g. (1.10 moles) of ethyl formate. The solution is added rapidly, dropwise, and at the end of the addition the funnel is replaced by the nitrogen-inlet tube. After 15 minutes the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The thick suspension is filtered by suction, and the filter cake is washed with anhydrous ether, care being taken to protect the product from atmospheric moisture. The solid salt is dried in a vacuum oven at ca. 70°, powdered, and stored in a tightly capped bottle. Sodio-2-formyl-6-methylcyclohexanone, a cream-colored powder, is obtained in 80–85% (130–138 g.) yield.

DESCRIPTION: B. 3-Chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran. A dry, 4-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a gas-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask is charged with 51 g. (2.11 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. Methyl bromide (200 g., 2.15 moles) is allowed to distill into the continuously stirred reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. The formation of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide requires approximately 2 hours. The gas-inlet tube is then replaced with a dry, 1-l. dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice–salt bath. The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0°), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, then concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 122–136 g. (65–72%) of a mixture of cis- and trans-3-chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid, boiling over the range 48–95° (17–18 mm.), sufficiently pure for use in the next step.

A 1000-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with an egg-shapped magnetic stir bar (0.625 × 1.5 in) and a rubber septum, is flame dried under a stream of nitrogen and cooled to ambient temperature. Following the addition of CH2Cl2 (250 mL) and 2-chloropyridine (13.1 mL, 139 mmol, 1.0 equiv), the flask is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 °C, bath temperature) under nitrogen. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (25.0 g, 153 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is then added slowly via syringe over 10 min through the septum down the side of the flask to allow cooling prior to mixing with the bulk solvent. The cold bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to ambient temperature (23 °C) and stirred an additional 12 h, leading to a white precipitate. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 °C) to deliver a white solid. Toluene (120 mL) is added to further induce precipitation, and after swirling under nitrogen for ~10 minutes, the toluene/CH2Cl2 mixture is removed from the solids via cannula under N2 pressure. The white solid is dried under reduced pressure at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h at 23 °C to afford 35.9 g (93%) of N-methyl-2-chloropyridinium trifluoromethane sulfonate (3) as a white solid (mp 147-148 °C).

Pyridine (9.1 mL, 112.5 mmol) is added to the solution via syringe, and the reaction mixture is cooled to −10°C with an ice/methanol cooling bath. Triflic anhydride (18.7 mL, 111.3 mmol) is added dropwise to the reaction mixture via syringe at a rate such that the temperature remains below −2°C. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at −10°C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. When the reaction is complete, water (75 mL) is added to the mixture and the resulting two-phase mixture is stirred for 15 min. In a 500-mL separatory funnel, the layers are separated and the organic (lower) layer is washed sequentially with 0.2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl), water, and brine (75 mL each). The final organic layer is concentrated to a yellow oil via rotary evaporation. The yellow oil is diluted with 25 mL of 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes and filtered through a bed of silica gel (63 g charged to a 150-mL filter funnel and prewetted with 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes, Note 5). The silica gel is washed with 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes until the desired triflate is no longer detected in the filtrate (250 mL).

DESCRIPTION: The flask containing the crude product is equipped with a capillary tube and distilling head and surrounded by a water bath, which may be heated by a hot plate or steam cone. A water-cooled condenser connects the distilling head with the center neck of a two-necked receiver which is surrounded by a Dry Ice bath. The outer neck of the receiver is fitted with a Dry Ice condenser arranged in such a way that vapors which first escape the receiver are condensed and returned to it. This apparatus is connected through a second Dry Ice trap and soda-lime tower to a vacuum pump. A fore-run is removed at a bath temperature of 20° and a pressure of about 15 mm. The receiver is changed, and the product is distilled at 18–25°/5 mm.

Vigorous stirring is continued for fifteen to twenty minutes, during which time the solution becomes hot and acetylglycine may begin to crystallize. The solution is placed in the refrigerator overnight to effect complete crystallization. The precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold water, and dried at 100–110°. This product weighs 75–85 g. and melts at 207–208°. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath at 50–60°.

DESCRIPTION: C. Mevalonolactone-2-13C. In a 250-mL Parr hydrogenation bottle are placed 50 mL of 95% ethanol, 0.107 g (0.001 mol) of palladium black, and 0.519 g (0.00217 mol) of 5-benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid-2-13C. The bottle is attached to a Parr hydrogenation apparatus, charged to 50 psig with hydrogen and shaken at room temperature for 2 hr. The hydrogen is flushed from the bottle with nitrogen, and the suspension is filtered by gravity through a layer of Celite with a medium-porosity sintered-glass Büchner funnel to separate the catalyst.

DESCRIPTION: Approximately 1.5 l. of anhydrous liquid ammonia is introduced into a dry 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser which is connected through a sodalime tube to a gas-absorption trap. Freshly cut sodium (47.2 g., 2.05 gram atoms) is converted to sodium amide by addition to the liquid ammonia in the presence of a small amount of ferric nitrate, according to p. 219. A 1-l. dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube connected to a source of dry nitrogen are attached to the third neck of the flask, and, after the blue color of the solution has disappeared and a gray suspension of sodium amide remains, 1.2 l. of dry ether is added as rapidly as the rate of vaporization of ammonia will permit. The ammonia is removed by warming the flask on a steam bath until refluxing of the ether occurs. Cyclohexanone (220 g., 2.24 moles) is added through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux on a steam bath for 3 hours. Nitrogen is then introduced through the gas inlet tube to maintain an inert atmosphere, and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 246 g. (2.03 moles) of allyl bromide in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added rapidly through the dropping funnel with stirring. If the reaction does not start soon after the completion of this addition the mixture is warmed cautiously on the steam bath. When the exothermic reaction has started it is controlled by cooling in the ice bath while refluxing continues for 20–30 minutes. The mixture is finally heated under reflux on the steam bath for 3 hours.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride tube is charged with 250 ml. of dry diethyl ether. With an acetone–dry ice bath the temperature of the ether is lowered to −10 to −15° and maintained within this range while a slow stream of hydrogen chloride is introduced, with slow stirring, for about 45 minutes. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a glass stopper, and 10.0 g. (0.0259 mole) of cholestan-3-one is added while the temperature of the stirred solution is kept below −15°. The reaction mixture is cooled to −20°, and 12.3 g. (0.188 g.-atom) of activated zinc is added over a 2–3 minute period. The temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to rise to −5°, and it is maintained between −4° and 0° for 2 hours. Stirring is not interrupted for the duration of the reaction. The mixture is finally cooled to −15° and poured slowly onto about 130 g. of crushed ice. The ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of ether that had been used to rinse the reaction vessel. The ethereal solutions are combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The ether is distilled under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath, leaving 9.3–9.5 g. of a colorless, liquid residue that solidifies on cooling. This solid is dissolved in 30–40 ml. of n-hexane. The solution is poured onto a 3.5 cm. by 17 cm. column of silica gel and eluted with 80–90 ml. of n-hexane. Distillation of the solvent under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath leaves 8.0–8.2 g. (82–84%) of cholestane, which, after recrystallization from ethanol-ether, yields 7.3–7.5 g. (76–77%) of product as plates m.p. 78–79° (lit., m.p. 80°)3.

The entire assembly is lowered into an oil bath maintained at 75–85°C, and the mixture is stirred. After an induction period of less than 30 min, an exothermic reaction occurs and produces a small amount of gas and a rise in the temperature of the oil bath (as much as 20°C for a small bath). After this point TLC shows that the reaction is essentially complete(Note 16)(Note 17). Unpurified 3 thus obtained is suitable for protodestannylation.

DESCRIPTION: A. 1,1-Bis(benzyloxy)propan-2-one (2). A one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with pyruvic aldehyde dimethyl acetal (12.1 mL, 100 mmol) in cyclohexane (50 mL), benzyl alcohol (22.8 mL, 220 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.95 g, 5 mmol). The resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h using a Dean–Stark separator for the removal of methanol. When the reaction is complete (approximately 2 h), approximately 8.1 mL (200 mmol) of MeOH is obtained. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and washed with saturated potassium carbonate solution (25 mL) and water (20 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted twice with cyclohexane (2 × 50 mL).

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 250 mL of water, 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 49.5 g (0.65 mol) of cyclopropylcarbinol; the reaction mixture is refluxed for ca. 100 min. The formation of cyclobutanol can be observed nearly instantaneously, as this alcohol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel (using a three-way adapter, parallel sidearm), and the reflux condenser is replaced by an ethanol–dry ice trap connected to a U-tube immersed in an ethanol–dry ice bath to ensure condensation of the very volatile cyclobutanone. The flask is charged with an additional 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 mL of water and 440 g (3.5 mol) of oxalic acid dihydrate. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for ca. 15 min to saturate the solution with oxalic acid. A solution of 162 g (1.62 mol) of chromium trioxide in 250 mL of water is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 10°C and 15°C (NaCl–ice bath, −5°C to −10°C) and the generation of carbon dioxide remains gentle. The reduction of each drop of chromic acid is practically instantaneous. As the addition of the reagent proceeds (1.5–2 hr), oxalic acid gradually dissolves and a dark-blue solution containing chromium(III) salts results. Just before the end of the oxidation (ca. 10 mL of the chromic acid solution left), the cyclobutanone (with traces of cyclobutanol) trapped in the U-tube (a few milliliters) is added to the reaction mixture. After the oxidation is completed, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for ca. 1 hr to bring the reaction mixture to room temperature and to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution.

DESCRIPTION: A. Ethyl 2,5-dimethylphenylhydroxymalonate. One hundred and seventy-four grams (1 mole) of ethyl oxomalonate and 265 g. (2.5 moles) of p-xylene are mixed in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a good stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a calcium chloride drying tube. Suitable precautions are taken to exclude moisture from the reaction mixture. While the mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath and stirred vigorously, 325 g. (1.25 moles) of anhydrous stannic chloride is added dropwise from the funnel. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 3 hours. The reaction mixture is poured with stirring into about 300 g. of cracked ice containing 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. On standing this mixture separates into two layers. Two hundred milliliters of ether is added, and the ether layer is washed with 100-ml. portions of water until the wash water is free from chlorides.

DESCRIPTION: B. Diphenylthiocarbazide. The above salt is transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and, while it is continuously stirred by hand, it is heated (hood) in a water bath maintained at 96–98°. After about 10–15 minutes the material softens to a taffylike mass, becomes yellow, foams, and evolves hydrogen sulfide. After about 20–30 minutes ammonia is evolved. When a distinct odor of ammonia is first detected, the beaker is removed from the bath, placed in a pan of cold water for 1 minute, and then surrounded immediately by cracked ice. About 150 ml. of absolute ethanol is added, the mixture is warmed slightly to loosen the mass, and the taffylike material is stirred until it is transformed into a granular precipitate. After the mixture has stood at room temperature for 1 hour, the precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of absolute ethanol.

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 200 g. (1.9 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 300 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl bromomalonate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 245) is heated for three hours in a 1-l. flask immersed in an oil bath at 150–160°. After the heating period, 300 cc. of xylene is added while the contents of the flask are still hot. The solid is broken up carefully with a rod, and the mixture is transferred to a 2-l. beaker. The reaction flask is then rinsed with a mixture of 100 cc. of xylene and 100 cc. of water. This washing is poured into the 2-l. beaker, and an additional 600 cc. of water is added. The solid readily dissolves upon stirring. The liquid mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, shaken well, and allowed to settle. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The xylene layer is transferred to a 1-l. distilling flask and distilled until the temperature of the liquid itself is 170°. The liquid residue is then transferred to a 500-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The fore-run up to 170°/15 mm. is discarded. The product, which is collected at 170–230°/15 mm. and, solidifies within about fifteen minutes.

DESCRIPTION: The flask A is heated by means of an oil bath maintained at 120–125°; the mixed vapors of alcohol and water, passing through the fractionating column, are condensed in D, and the moist alcohol is delivered under the surface of the alcohol contained in flask B. In flask B are placed 250 cc. of absolute alcohol and about 200 g. of freshly ignited potassium carbonate. Flask B is heated in an oil bath maintained at about 95–100°. The moist alcohol delivered to the flask B is dried by the potassium carbonate and subsequently returned as vapor under the surface of the liquid in flask A. The tube C, which is provided with a calcium chloride tube and is open to the air, acts as a vent for the otherwise closed system. The reaction is run for about five hours. The excess alcohol is then distilled, the residue of ethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 98–101°/21 mm. is collected. The yield is 234–264 g.

DESCRIPTION: An intimate mixture of 166 g. (1.2 moles) of anhydrous potassium carbonate and 294 g. (2 moles) of phthalimide is treated with 506 g. (4 moles) of benzyl chloride, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 190° under a reflux condenser for three hours. While the mixture is still hot, the excess benzyl chloride is removed by steam distillation. Near the end of this operation the benzyl phthalimide crystallizes. It is advisable to cool the mixture rapidly with very vigorous agitation so that the material is in as fine a state of division as possible. The solid is filtered on a large Büchner funnel, thoroughly washed with water, and drained as completely as possible by suction. It is then washed once with 400 cc. of 60 per cent alcohol and drained again. The yield of this product, melting at 100–110°, is 340–375 g. (72–79 per cent of the theoretical amount). It is conveniently purified by crystallizing from glacial acetic acid. The recovery in the crystallization is about 80 per cent, and the pure product melts at 116° (corr.).

DESCRIPTION: B. Diethyl (R)-(−)-[1-((N-(R)-(1-phenyl-2-methoxyethyl)amino)-3-methylbutyl)]phosphonate (4) . To an oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar are added isovaleraldehyde (3) (9.4 g, 109 mmol) and dry toluene (100 mL) under an argon atmosphere. The solution is cooled to 0°C (ice bath) and a solution of (R)-(−)-1-amino-1-phenyl-2-methoxyethane (2) (16.5 g, 109 mmol) in dry toluene (160 mL) is introduced dropwise over 45 min via a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel.

The flask is charged with 0.857 g (22.6 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride and THF (56 mL). (CAUTION: lithium aluminum hydride is very reactive and must be handled carefully to avoid contact with water). The resulting suspension is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath, and a solution of (2R,3R)-2,3- dimethylsuccinic acid (1.10 g, 7.53 mmol) in THF (24 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min from the dropping funnel, which is rinsed with THF (4 mL). The resulting suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath for 12 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath and is diluted with ethyl ether (80 mL). Water (0.9 mL) is added dropwise slowly, followed after 5 min by 3 M aq. sodium hydroxide solution (0.9 mL) and, after 5 min, more water (2.6 mL). The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and is stirred at this temperature for 2 h. The white precipitate is removed by filtration of the mixture through a ceramic Büchner funnel lined with filter paper (Whatman 90 mm thick qualitative circles) fitted onto a 100-mL filter flask. The white residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. After breaking the precipitate into small pieces with a metal spatula, THF (20 mL) is added and then the suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath with vigorous stirring for 60 min. The precipitate is removed by filtration through a medium-porosity, glass-fritted Büchner funnel into a 100-mL filter flask and is washed with ethyl ether (3 × 20 mL). The combined filtrates are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (6 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (25 °C, 40 mmHg) to afford the crude product as a light yellow oil. The product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation to afford 0.80 g (90%) of (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol as a viscous, clear oil.

DESCRIPTION: The malononitrile begins to distil at 113°/30 mm. (125°/50 mm.). The temperature of the oil bath is slowly raised over a period of twenty-five minutes to 180° and the nitrile collected between 113° and 125°. When the distillation has almost ceased, the oil bath is removed so as to prevent discoloration of the product. The yield of crude nitrile is 80–95 g. (67–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). The nitrile may be purified by vacuum distillation with about 10 per cent loss; it is collected between 113° and 120°/30 mm. One distillation yields a water-clear liquid, which quickly freezes to an ice-like solid melting at 28–30°. The product has a faint odor resembling that of acetamide.

DESCRIPTION: The flask is next fitted for distillation with superheated steam and with a separatory funnel for the introduction of water into the center of the flask. A 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a vertical condenser is used as a receiver (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 479). The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160°, and superheated steam at 220–250° is introduced. The temperature of the oil bath is then gradually raised to 200°. If foaming becomes too great, a few drops of water are added from the separatory funnel, care being taken that the water does not strike the hot glass walls. Steam distillation is continued until no more dimethylpyrrole comes over. This takes from one to two hours, and the distillate amounts to 2.5–3 l. The distillate is extracted once with 200 cc. of ether and three times with 100-cc. portions, and the extract is dried for two hours over 20 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation from a 100-cc. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. fractionating side arm, the solution being added gradually through a separatory funnel. After the ether is removed the residue is distilled and the fraction boiling at 160–165° is collected. The yield is 27 to 30 g. (57–63 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.

DESCRIPTION: The distillate is then dried over solid potassium hydroxide for twenty-four hours and finally over metallic sodium. The allylamine is distilled from a water bath held at 70–78°, through a 12-in. fractionating column, into a receiver immersed in an ice bath. Two fractions are collected: up to 54°/746 mm., and 54–57°/746 mm. The lower fraction amounts to 14–16 g. and on redistillation yields 6–8 g. of pure material.

(0.36 mole) of pulverized coumalic acid (p. 201) in small portions. The reaction is slightly exothermic, and the mixture is maintained between 20° and 30° by occasional immersion of the flask into an ice bath. Methanol (70 ml.) is then added in small portions with frequent swirling, and the temperature is held between 25° and 35°. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour, cooled to about 40°, and poured slowly with stirring into 800 ml. of water in a 2-l. beaker while the temperature is maintained below 40° by an ice bath. Anhydrous sodium carbonate is added in small portions with stirring until the mixture is slightly alkaline. The precipitated ester is freed of inorganic salts by slurrying four times with 100-ml. portions of cold water, filtered, and air-dried overnight.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 100 g. (0.14 mole) of pure trimyristin (p. 538) and 200 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for two hours, with frequent shaking or stirring until the trimyristin has become emulsified. It is then diluted with 300 cc. of water and the heating is continued for another one-half hour, by which time the solution should be almost clear, indicating complete saponification. The solution is now poured with stirring into a hot solution of 650 cc. of water and 100 cc. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid. The free acid which separates is not entirely clear, owing to the presence of unchanged sodium salt. A gentle current of steam is passed into the hot mixture until the oily layer is transparent; this requires about fifteen minutes. The acid is allowed to cool and solidify; it is removed and freed of small quantities of salt and water by filtering through paper in a steam-jacketed funnel. The yield is 84–90 g.

DESCRIPTION: While still hot the solution is acidified by adding 900 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) from a separatory funnel with a tube delivering the acid to the bottom of the flask; this prevents the formation of a layer of acid over the unneutralized solution. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then chilled in an ice bath. The resorcyclic acid crystallizes in prisms which are almost colorless but which, on exposure to air, turn pink owing to contamination with a small amount of resorcinol. The yield of crude acid is 225 g. By extracting the mother liquor with ether several times, 35 g. of resorcylic acid and some unchanged resorcinol can be recovered. The resorcylic acid is extracted from the ether by shaking with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and again extracted withether. The ether is then evaporated, leaving the resorcylic acid, which is usually highly colored and must be recrystallized several times from boiling water and charcoal to remove the color.

(0.501 mole) of 1,4,5,8-tetrahydronaphthalene [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 731 (1988)] and 200 ml. of anhydrous dichloromethane. To the resulting solution is added 75 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate. After the suspension is cooled with an ice bath, 104.5 g. (0.55 mole) of commercial 40% peracetic acid and is added dropwise over a period of 20–30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at approximately 15° and stirring vigorously.

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 50 g. (0.257 mole) of dry hydroquinone diacetate (p. 452) and 116 g. (0.87 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is finely powdered in a mortar and introduced into a dry 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an air condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a gas-absorption trap. The flask is placed in an oil bath which is heated slowly from room temperature so that at the end of about 30 minutes the temperature of the oil reaches 110–120°, at which point the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins. The temperature is then raised slowly to 160–165° and maintained at that point for about 3 hours; at the end of about 2 hours the evolution of hydrogen chloride becomes very slow and the mass assumes a green color and becomes pasty in consistency.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, and clamped in a position such that it may be surrounded by a bath of water and ice when desired, are placed 300 g. (1.62 moles) of β-acetylaminonaphthalene (m.p. 131–132°) and 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. With the mixture at room temperature, the stirrer is set in motion, and 200 g. (143 cc., 2.1 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) is added dropwise over a period of forty-five minutes; the temperature is kept below 40° by occasionally immersing the flask in the cooling bath. When about one-tenth of the nitric acid has been added, the reaction mixture sets to a mass that is stirred with difficulty. The addition of nitric acid is stopped at this point. After three to five minutes the mass becomes fluid, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed. When about one-fourth of the nitric acid has been added, all the solid material dissolves. Considerable heat is evolved at this point, and good cooling is required to keep the temperature from rising above 40°; the mixture must be cooled during the addition of the remainder of the acid. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer.

DESCRIPTION: In a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube are placed 340 g. (4 moles) of cyanoacetic acid and 2 l. of anhydrous ether. To the stirred solution, 834 g. (4 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride is added in portions through the third neck of the flask, which is sealed between additions. The mixture is cooled occasionally with an ice bath to prevent excessive refluxing, and, after the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 0.5 hour or until the phosphorus pentachloride dissolves completely. The reflux condenser is removed and replaced with apparatus for downward distillation, and the ether is distilled from a water bath at 50–60°, after which most of the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at reduced pressure (20–25 mm. with a bath temperature of 55–65°), the receiver being cooled in an ice-salt bath. The red, oily residue is dissolved in 200 ml. of benzene and the benzene and residual phosphorus oxychloride distilled under reduced pressure. This operation is repeated with 200 ml. of fresh benzene to ensure complete removal of phosphorus oxychloride. The residue is then cooled to room temperature and is transferred to a 500-ml. pressure-equalized dropping funnel for immediate use in the following step.

DESCRIPTION: In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient reflux condenser of wide bore, are placed, in the following order, 80 g. of powdered crystalline ferrous sulfate, 865 g. (687 cc., 9.4 moles) of c.p. glycerol, 218 g. (213 cc., 2.3 moles) of aniline, 170 g. (141 cc., 1.4 moles) of nitrobenzene, and 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The contents of the flask are well mixed and the mixture heated gently over a free flame. As soon as the liquid begins to boil, the flame is removed, since the heat evolved by the reaction is sufficient to keep the mixture boiling for one-half to one hour. If the reaction proceeds too violently at the beginning, the reflux condenser may be assisted by placing a wet towel over the upper part of the flask. When the boiling has ceased the heat is again applied and the mixture boiled for five hours. It is then allowed to cool to about 100° and transferred to a 12-l. flask; the 5-l. flask is rinsed out with a small quantity of water.

The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer which will stir efficiently any volume of liquid which may be in the flask, and the solution is cooled to 0° in an ice-salt bath. Separate solutions of 1.2 kg. (3.65 moles) of potassium ferricyanide in 2.4 l. of water and of 300 g. (7.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water are prepared and added dropwise from two separatory funnels to the well-stirred solution of the pyridinium salt at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 10°. The rate of addition of these two solutions is regulated so that all the sodium hydroxide solution has been introduced into the reaction mixture when one-half of the potassium ferricyanide solution has been added. This usually requires about one hour. The remaining half of the potassium ferricyanide is then added during another hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand five hours, during which time it comes to room temperature.

DESCRIPTION: Thirty grams (0.14 mole) of 2-methyldodecanoic acid is brominated exactly as described in the preparation of 2-methylenedodecanoic acid (p.616). The crude product, after the 18-hour heating period, is allowed to cool; then 56 ml. (1.4 moles) of commercial absolute methanol is added at such a rate that the exothermic reaction is kept under control. The resultant pale-orange two-phase mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 15 minutes, cooled, and diluted with 150 ml. of water containing about 2 g. of sodium sulfite. The bromo ester is extracted with two portions (75 ml. and 25 ml.) of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation of the filtered solution from a 250-ml. flask heated on a steam bath, and the last traces of solvent are eliminated by reducing the pressure with a water aspirator. The crude bromo ester remaining amounts to 41.5–42.5 g. and is thermally unstable to distillation at reduced pressure.

DESCRIPTION: The ester is hydrolyzed by heating under reflux for 1.5 hours with 50 ml. of 95% ethanol and 4.4 g. of 85% potassium hydroxide (0.066 mole) for each 10 g. (0.044 mole) of ester. Two-thirds of the ethanol is removed by distillation; then the residue is diluted with five volumes of water and acidified to Congo red with 5N sulfuric acid. The organic acid is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of petroleum ether, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The petroleum ether is removed from the extracts by flash distillation as described above, and the residual acid is distilled at reduced pressure through a 61-cm. Podbielniak-type column.

DESCRIPTION: A. Diisopropoxytitanium(IV) dibromide. A 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed pre-weighed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and an argon inlet is charged with 20 mL of hexane and titanium(IV) bromide (7.3 g, 20 mmol). To the red-brown suspension is added titanium(IV) isopropoxide (5.9 mL, 20 mmol) slowly (~ 7 min) at ambient temperature from a syringe. The addition of titanium(IV) isopropoxide causes the mixture to warm to about 37°C. After stirring for 10 min, the now yellow solution is allowed to stand for 6 hr at room temperature, and the pale yellow precipitate that forms is isolated by removing the supernatant liquid with a syringe. The solid residue is then washed with hexane (5 mL × 2) and recrystallized from hexane (10 mL). Recrystallization is carried out in the same flask by heating the solution to reflux and then leaving it at room temperature overnight. Again the supernatant liquid is removed with a syringe and the crystalline residue is vacuum dried to give 5.7 g (44%) of yellow, highly moisture sensitive product. While still in the original flask, this product is dissolved in 88 mL of dry toluene to give a 0.2 M solution.

DESCRIPTION: B. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal.3 A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a gas inlet, an acetone–dry ice condenser with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets, a stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is placed in an acetone–dry ice bath and anhydrous ammonia is condensed into the flask (400 mL). A small piece of potassium metal (ca. 0.5 g) is added to the liquid ammonia and the cooling bath is removed. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.1 g) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature, at which time the deep blue color turns to gray. The remaining potassium metal (12.2 g, 0.31 g-atom total) is added in 0.5-g pieces over ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until a gray suspension results (20–30 min). A −50°C cooling bath is placed under the flask and the stopper is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalized dropping funnel containing 22.9 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane in 50 mL of anhydrous ether. This solution is added dropwise to the solution of freshly generated potassium amide over 15 min while the temperature is maintained at −50°C. After the solution is stirred for 3 hr at −50° to −60°C, solid ammonium chloride is added slowly to quench the excess potassium amide. The cooling bath is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During the course of the evaporation, anhydrous ether (350 mL total) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace the ammonia. After the temperature has reached 0°C, the brown reaction mixture is filtered by suction through a coarse fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts and the salts are washed twice with 25 mL of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (80–100 mm, 30°C) to constant weight (ca. 4–5 hr). The residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled, short-path distillation head, and the product is distilled (1.25 mm; 30–35°C) into an ice-cooled receiver. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal is obtained as a colorless liquid (6.1–7.8 g, 55–70% yield,).

DESCRIPTION: C. 2-Methoxymethoxy-1-nonen-3-ol. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a three-way stopcock connected to a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is evacuated, purged with nitrogen, and charged with 200 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 8.83 g of methoxymethyl vinyl ether (100 mmol). The solution is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and then 88.7 mL (100 mmol) of sec-butyllithium (1.13 M in cyclohexane) is added dropwise over 15 min with stirring via syringe. After the addition is complete, the yellow mixture is allowed to warm to −30°C over 30 min and stir for 1 hr. The mixture is recooled to −78°C and 11.44 g (100 mmol) of heptanal is added dropwise over 5 min through the dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min and to stir for 3 hr. A 100-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution is added, the mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, mixed thoroughly, and the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted three times with 50 mL of diethyl ether. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 12.6–13.1 g (62–65%) of 2-methoxymethoxy-1-nonen-3-ol as a colorless liquid, bp 82–84°C (0.4 mm).

It is washed four or five times with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the washings are almost colorless and then once with water. It is dried by shaking with crushed calcium chloride, and then distilled from a 2-l. flask through a short column at a fairly rapid rate. The first runnings may contain a little water and can be further dried. The product is a colorless liquid with an odor resembling that of benzene.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for several hours (preferably overnight) and is then extracted repeatedly with 500-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, until the alkaline extracting medium remains practically colorless when shaken with the ethereal solution. Usually five 500-cc. portions of the sodium hydroxide solution are required. The combined alkaline extracts are poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 700–750 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 1 kg. of ice. The crystals of isonitrosopropiophenone are filtered with suction and dried. The product weighs 370–390 g. (65–68 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 111–113°. This material can be crystallized from about 550 cc. of toluene and yields 315–335 g. of snow-white crystals, m.p. 112–113°.

DESCRIPTION: A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a stirrer, a thermometer for reading low temperatures, and a condenser, to the upper end of which is attached a tube for disposing of the hydrogen chloride evolved. A mixture of 200 cc. of carbon disulfide and 180 g. (1.35 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is placed in the flask which is then immersed in an ice-salt freezing mixture and stirred very vigorously until the temperature of the mixture is −5° or below. A mixture of 175 g. (1.3 moles) of p-cymene and 110 g. (100 cc., 1.4 moles) of acetyl chloride is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 5°. This addition requires about three and one-third hours.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.—In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide. The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234–238°, amounts to 80–90 g. (66–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.

DESCRIPTION: To this vigorously stirred solution is added slowly a solution of 44.5 g. (0.20 mole) of benzalphthalide2 in 400 ml. of dry benzene. After about half of this solution has been added, the magnesium complex begins to separate; it hinders the stirring somewhat. When all the phthalide solution has been admitted (about 1 hour), the reflux condenser is replaced by a still head carrying a thermometer and attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. The bulk of the solvent is then removed; this requires about 30 minutes, the temperature of the vapor remaining at 50° for about half this time and rising to about 65° toward the end. About 220–230 ml. of distillate is obtained. The flask and contents are then immersed in an ice bath, and the magnesium complex is decomposed by the slow addition of a cold solution of 15 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 ml. of water with rapid stirring. The upper benzene layer is separated and transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the solvent is removed by distillation from a steam bath; this requires about 4 hours. The residual thick red syrup is transferred to a 125-ml. Claisen flask with a wide side arm set up for vacuum distillation. The residue is heated under a pressure of about 10 mm. to remove all low-boiling material and then is distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 215–255°/6 mm. (195–220°/1 mm.) is collected, most of the distillate coming over at 235–240°/6 mm. The distillate is dissolved in 50 ml. of boiling benzene, 200 ml. of hot 95% ethanol is added, and the solution is chilled in an ice bath for 2 hours. The red, crystalline 2,3-diphenylindone is collected on a filter, washed with 50 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and air-dried. The yield is 34–40 g. (60–71%) of red crystals melting at 149–151° and.

An oven-dried, 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask (or a 1-L, three-necked flask with a Claisen head fitted in a side neck) is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser with a bubbler, and a 200-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a nitrogen inlet. Under a gentle flow of nitrogen the flask is charged with 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). The addition funnel is charged with a 1.9 M solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride in diethyl ether (83 mL, 0.158 mol). The mixture is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice/acetone bath, and isopropylmagnesium chloride is added over a few minutes with stirring. At this temperature, a solution of diethyl (trichloromethyl)phosphonate (38.3 g, 0.150 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 15 min at −78°C producing a clear orange solution. Anhydrous ethanol (12 g, 0.260 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) is added dropwise at −78°C, producing a clear yellow solution. The resulting mixture is stirred for a few minutes, then allowed to warm slowly to −40°C. The reaction mixture is poured into a beaker containing a stirred mixture of 3 M hydrochloric acid (70 mL), and an equal volume of crushed ice and dichloromethane (70 mL). The yellow color initially dissipates, but the solution becomes yellow orange upon warming to room temperature. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 60 mL). The extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the filtration, the solvents are evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The bright yellow, crude liquid (36.3 g) is transferred to a pear-shaped flask fitted with a 10-cm Vigreux column and distilled under reduced pressure to give 26.6 g (80%) of diethyl (dichloromethyl)phosphonate, 1, as a pale yellow liquid, bp 115–119°C/9 mm, >90% pure by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy and.

DESCRIPTION: Upon cooling the mixture, the oily layer of amine solidifies to a red crystalline mass. The crude amine is filtered with suction, washed with two 60-cc. portions of ice-cold water, pressed thoroughly, and transferred to an ordinary 125-cc. Claisen flask. The filtrate is extracted with three 60-cc. portions of benzene, the extracts are transferred separately to the Claisen flask, and the benzene is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The residual amine is distilled under reduced pressure and is collected at 172–174°/24 mm.. The distillate solidifies quickly to a mass of colorless crystals which melt sharply at 87.5–88°. From 58 g. (0.32 mole) of veratric amide there is obtained 39–40 g. (80–82 per cent of the theoretical amount) of 4-aminoveratrole.

DESCRIPTION: This salt mixture is dissolved in 270 cc. of water, and the acid potassium salt is precipitated by adding 8 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 30 cc. of water. After standing for three hours, or overnight, the mixture is filtered with suction. The acid salt is then dissolved in 240 cc. of water to which 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid has been added, and the solution is extracted with five 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are evaporated to dryness on a steam bath, leaving pure hydrated crystals of acetylenedicarboxylic acid.

The condenser is replaced by a short Vigreux column and distillation head, and the heating is continued until most of the methanol has distilled. The two-phase residue is cooled and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column to yield 68–77 g.

DESCRIPTION: The crude bis ester is melted on a steam cone and poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask containing 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and approximately 10 g. of small chips of porous plate. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. There is a copious evolution of carbon dioxide which should be directed to a gas-absorption trap since it is accompanied by acetic acid vapors. The mixture is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2 l. of ice water in a 4-l. beaker. Enough ether is added to allow separation of the layers, and the organic layer is returned to the beaker with 1.2–1.3 l. of water. With the aid of good stirring the mixture is neutralized by slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until the effervescence ceases. The layers are separated, and the material so obtained may be used immediately for the preparation of 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. To obtain 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, the ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with 100 ml. of water containing 2 ml. of acetic acid, is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. After a very slight fore-run the main fraction is collected at 135–155°/10 mm. This is redistilled through a moderately good column, preferably of the Widmer or Vigreux type. The product is 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, b.p. 136–138°/9 mm. The yield is 220–234 g. (47–50%).

DESCRIPTION: Determination of the yield of propellane. Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated. Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.

DESCRIPTION: For purification, 200 g. of the crude product is suspended in 1 l. of hot water and treated with a solution of 88 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water. The solution is stirred mechanically and the isatin passes into solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then added, with stirring, until a slight precipitate appears. This requires about 290–300 cc. of an acid made by diluting one volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with two volumes of water. The mixture is then filtered at once, the precipitate is rejected, and the filtrate is made acid to Congo red paper with hydrochloric acid. The solution is then cooled rapidly, and the isatin which separates is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The pure product thus obtained weighs 150–170 g. and and melts at 197–200° (corr.).

DESCRIPTION: Hinsberg separation. To this solution, which should be cold (5–8°), is now added 23 g. of benzenesulfonyl chloride,3 and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. The separatory funnel is replaced by a stopper bearing a thermometer, and the contents of the flask are warmed to 40° and stirred until the odor of the acid chloride is no longer noticeable. This usually requires about 30 minutes. The 1-n-butylpyrrolidine is separated from the non-volatile di-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide by steam distillation, the amine being collected in dilute acid as before. The acid solution is then evaporated to dryness, and the amine is liberated by adding 20% sodium hydroxide solution until the aqueous layer turns red litmus blue. The amine is extracted by one 200-ml. portion of ether, and the ethereal solution is dried over 15–20 pellets of potassium hydroxide. After the ether has been distilled from the decanted solution, the residue is distilled from an oil bath. The yield of 1-n-butylpyrrolidine boiling at 154–155°/758 mm. is 44–51 g.

Most of the benzene may be distilled under ordinary pressure, and the remainder, and any low-boiling impurities, under diminished pressure. The pure phenylhydrazine boils at 137–138°/18 mm., and is obtained as a pale yellow liquid. It can be crystallized on cooling in an ice bath; the crystals melt at 23°. The crude phenylhydrazine from two lots of aniline (744 g.) is best distilled at one time and gives 695–725 g. of pure product (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: Five hundred grams (2.34 moles) of phenyl salicylate is heated in a 1-l. special distilling flask having a wide side arm 20–25 cm. long, and fitted with two thermometers, one extending to the bottom of the flask, and the other just below the side arm. When the temperature of the liquid reaches 275–285°, phenol begins to distil. The heating is so regulated that the temperature of the vapor never exceeds 175° and preferably remains below 170°. In this way the phenol distils at the rate of 5–10 drops per minute. The temperature of the liquid rises gradually, and after six to seven hours reaches 350–355°. At this point the distillation of the phenol practically ceases; the weight of the distillate is 220–225 g.

DESCRIPTION: To 1 l. of milk, from which the cream has been largely separated, 0.05 M hydrochloric acid is slowly added, with stirring, through a capillary tube extending to the bottom of the beaker. The addition is continued until the solution attains a pH of 4.6. The end point is determined by withdrawing 5-cc. samples, diluting to 50 cc., adding methyl red, and matching against a buffered series. Approximately 1 l. of acid is required; the separation of the casein is practically complete at this point. Three liters of water is then added, stirring is discontinued, and the flocculent precipitate of casein is allowed to settle in the refrigerator for twelve to twenty-four hours. The clear supernatant liquid which contains soluble proteins and salts is removed as completely as possible by siphoning; the precipitate is collected on a suction funnel and washed with cold distilled water until the washings are free of calcium (give no precipitate with ammonium oxalate).

DESCRIPTION: The 1-L flask containing the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 is equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar. The solids are scraped off the walls using a spatula. The flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and charged with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g) and dichloromethane (140 mL). The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and treated sequentially with triethylamine (60.0 mL, 43.6 g, 0.425 mol, 1.5 equiv) and pivaldehyde (95% purity, 35 mL, 28 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.07 equiv corrected for purity). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature. Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 °C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 °C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 °C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.

A solution of (−)-4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose (29.2 g, 142 mmol, Note 12) in water (120 mL) is added dropwise with stirring and under permanent control of the pH and temperature. The temperature in the flask should be kept below 10°C, and the pH is maintained at approximately 4 by dropwise addition of 8 N aqueous sodium hydroxide. After stirring for 3 hr at = 10°C, the pH is adjusted to 6.5 by addition of more 8 N sodium hydroxide and stirring is continued for another 2 hr at room temperature. The solution is evaporated under reduced pressure (50°C, 30 mm) and the residue dried at room temperature and 0.02 mm (oil vacuum). To the pale-yellow, solid crude product, ethyl acetate (80 mL) is added and the flask is heated for 2 min at 80°C with stirring. The suspension is filtered and the solid residue is treated three times with ethyl acetate (80 mL each) as described above. The combined, filtered extracts are dried over sodium sulfate for 1 hr with stirring and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30°C, 30 mm), followed by slow removal of solvent at 0.02 mm (oil vacuum) at room temperature to yield 20.1 g (97%) of (−)-2,4-O-ethylidene-D-erythrose as a colorless, amorphous solid, mp 120-121°C.

DESCRIPTION: A. 2-Hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, Method 1. A mixture of 23 g. (1 g. atom) of sodium metal cut in approximately 1-cm. cubes, 2 l. of dry ether, 98 g. (103 ml., 1 mole) of redistilled cyclohexanone, and 110 g. (120 ml., 1.5 moles) of ethyl formate is placed in a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, stopper, and vent tube. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 5 ml. of ethyl alcohol to the stirred mixture, which is then placed in a cold water bath. Stirring is continued for 6 hours. After standing overnight, 25 ml. of ethyl alcohol is added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional hour. After the addition of 200 ml. of water, the mixture is shaken in a 3-l. separatory funnel. The ether layer is washed with 50 ml. of water, and the combined aqueous extracts are washed with 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is acidified with 165 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is extracted twice with 300 ml. of ether. The ether solution is washed with 25 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and then is dried by the addition of approximately 30 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate powder. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration, and the ether is evaporated on the steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure using a 6-inch Vigreux column. After a small fore-run there is obtained 88–94 g. (70–74%) of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, b.p. 70–72°/5 mm., nD25 1.5110.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 120 g. (1.83 moles) of 92% ethylenediamine, 300 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 300 ml. of water. The flask is attached to an efficient reflux condenser, and 121 ml. of carbon disulfide is placed in a separatory funnel attached to the top of the condenser by means of a notched cork. About 15 to 20 ml. of the carbon disulfide is added, and the flask is shaken to mix the contents. A vigorous reaction takes place, and it may be necessary to cool the flask. After the reaction has started, a water bath at 60° is placed under the flask and the balance of the carbon disulfide is added at such a rate that the vapors reflux about one-third the way up the condenser. About 2 hours is required for the addition of the carbon disulfide. At this time the bath temperature is raised to about 100°, and the mixture is allowed to reflux for 1 hour. Then 15 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is refluxed under a good hood (bath at 100°) for 9–10 hours. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the product is filtered by suction on a Büchner funnel and washed with 200–300 ml. of cold acetone. A yield of 156–167 g. (83–89%) of white crystals is obtained melting at 197–198° and.

DESCRIPTION: The crude bromo ester is mixed with 82.5 ml. (0.70 mole) of pure quinoline(Note 3) in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with an air condenser, and the mixture is heated for 3 hours with an oil bath maintained at 160–170°. The black mixture is cooled, treated with 150 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid, then shaken thoroughly with 200 ml. of petroleum ether until most of the tarry material has dissolved(Note 4). The aqueous phase is separated and washed with an additional 200 ml. of petroleum ether, and the combined organic extracts are washed with 10% hydrochloric acid and then with water. This washing cycle is repeated until the washes are colorless (two acid washes usually suffice); finally, the petroleum ether solution is washed once more with water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent is flash-distilled as described above, and the residual liquid ester is distilled through a 61-cm. Podbielniak-type column(Note 5). The colorless unsaturated ester distils at 153–154°/14.5 mm. after a small fore-run. The yield is 22–27 g.

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 200 g. (2 moles) of mesityl oxide (p. 345) and 280 cc. of aqueous ammonia (27 per cent) is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The stirrer should be inserted through a stopper in such a way that the flask is nearly air-tight. Because of the heat generated during the reaction it is desirable to keep tap water running over the flask. After stirring for several hours the system becomes homogeneous. When this point is reached the stirring is discontinued, and the well-stoppered flask is allowed to stand at room temperature for three days.

A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser, a nitrogen inlet tube, a 50-ml. dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated through a mercury bubbler, flamed dry, and flushed with nitrogen three times. The flask is charged with 36.0 g. (0.500 mole) of tert-butylamine, and 36.5 g. (0.501 mole) of isobutyraldehyde is placed in the dropping funnel. Half of the isobutyraldehyde is added slowly through the dropping funnel before the remaining half-volume is added rapidly. The milky solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour; the water layer is then pipeted out, and excess anhydrous potassium carbonate is added. Filtration and distillation of this reaction mixture gives 32.0 g. (50%) of N-(2-methylpropylidene)-tert-butylamine, b.p. 50° (75 mm.).

DESCRIPTION: For further purification the product is dissolved in a solution of 140 g. (3.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water and steam-distilled from a 2-l. flask until a test portion of the distillate is free of oil. The solution remaining in the flask is cooled to room temperature and acidified with 375 cc. (4.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The heptanoic acid is separated and distilled from a Claisen flask with fractionating side arm. The recovery of acid boiling at 155–157°/80 mm. is 85–90 per cent of the weight of impure material used. Titration indicates it to be 100 per cent pure.

DESCRIPTION: After cooling, the crude product is transferred to a separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The upper layer is washed once with an equal volume of warm water, and then with successive portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution until all acid has been removed. It is then washed once with warm water, which is separated as completely as possible. The product thus washed is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The first few drops of distillate containing some water are discarded: the main fraction distils at 139–142°/2 mm. The yield is 1080 g. (90%).

DESCRIPTION: The base may be purified by steam distillation but distillation under reduced pressure is more satisfactory. The oil is dried over 5 g. of solid sodium hydroxide and distilled under reduced pressure. The first portion of the distillate may contain p-toluidine and must be carefully separated, as it causes rapid discoloration. The 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene is obtained as a colorless liquid of b.p. 120–122°/30 mm. or 92–94°/3 mm. It solidifies on cooling and melts at 16–18°. The loss on purification is about 15 per cent of the weight of the crude base.

DESCRIPTION: The amine salt (147 g.) is placed in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 1 l. of 95% ethanol by heating the mixture on a steam bath. To the solution, which has been cooled to room temperature, is added 39 g. (35.8 ml.) of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is stirred. Water (900 ml.) is added cautiously at first and with vigorous agitation until crystals of abietic acid begin to appear; the remainder of the water is then added more rapidly. The abietic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with water until the acetic acid has been removed completely as indicated by tests with indicator paper. Recrystallization can be effected by dissolving the crude product in 700 ml. of 95% ethanol, adding 600 ml. of water as described above, and cooling the solution. The yield of abietic acid is 98 g.

DESCRIPTION: A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a vent is placed in a water bath and charged with 600 ml. of 98% sulfuric acid. Powdered adamantane [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 16 (1973)], (100 g., 0.735 mole), is added in one portion to the stirred acid, and the mixture is heated rapidly (with the water bath) to an internal temperature of 70°. The internal temperature is then raised gradually to 80° over a 2-hour period while vigorous stirring is maintained. After stirring at 80° is continued for an additional 2 hours, the temperature is raised to 82°. When almost all the adamantane is dissolved, the residual sublimed material is scraped and rinsed from the walls of the flask and.

DESCRIPTION: After six hours, the solution is cooled to room temperature and a cold solution of 192 g. (4.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 350 cc. of water is poured down the side of the flask so that most of it settles to the bottom without mixing with the solution in the flask. The flask is then connected to a condenser for downward distillation and is shaken to mix the two layers. The resulting free amine separates. The flask is heated and the amine, together with some water, distils. The distillation is continued until no amine separates from a test portion of the distillate. There is a small quantity of an oily liquid left floating in the flask. This is probably an impurity from the diallylcyanamide.

DESCRIPTION: B. (S)-(−)-1-Formyl-2-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. The 2-L flask containing the crude hydroxymethyl derivative (ca. 1 mol) is equipped with a dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar and cooled to 0°C. Eighty milliliters (1.3 mol) of methyl formate is added over a period of 20 min and stirring is continued for 30 min at 0°C to give a green-colored solution. Excess methyl formate is evaporated at 30°C, affording a dark oil, which is taken up in 600 mL of dichloromethane and dried twice by stirring over a sufficient amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration through Celite, using a large column, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at 30°C. Any remaining traces of solvents are removed by stirring under reduced pressure using and oil pump (20°C at 1 mm). This procedure takes about 2 hr and yields ca. 130 g (ca. 1 mol) of the dry, crude N-formyl compound, which is used in the next step without further purification.

DESCRIPTION: A 4-L beaker equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and thermometer is charged with a solution of 125 g of ferrous sulfate and 50 g of tartaric acid in a total volume of 500 mL of deionized water. The solution is stirred and cooled by means of an ice–water bath to 10°C. When the epoxidation reaction mixture reaches 0°C, it is immediately poured into the stirred contents of the beaker. The resulting reaction is mildly exothermic, causing a temperature rise to ca. 20°C. After the exothermic reaction has subsided and the temperature has begun to drop (ca. 5 min), the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min. The contents of the beaker are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 250-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 35°C (70 mm) to give 85.9–89.9 g of pale-amber oil.

A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer is charged with a mixture of 19.5 g (0.120 mole) of N-aminophthalimide, 108 g. (0.600 mole) of (E)-stilbene, and 300 ml. of dichloromethane. To the resulting suspension is added 60 g. (ca. 0.12 mole) of lead tetraäcetate over a period of 10 minutes, at room temperature with vigorous stirring. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes, after which time the mixture is filtered through Celite®, which is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined filtrates are transferred to a 4-l. beaker, and 1.5 l. of pentane is added with gentle stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The yellow precipitate that forms after 15 minutes is suction filtered and redissolved in 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution obtained is swirled for 5 minutes with 20 g. of silica gel, filtered through Celite®, which is washed with two 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. To this dichloromethane solution is added 1.5 l. of pentane, with cooling. The precipitate that forms after 0.5 hour is dried under vacuum (10 mm.) at room temperature for 5 hours, yielding 16–21 g.

DESCRIPTION: The crude aminonaphthol is washed into a beaker containing a solution at 30° of 2 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate and 53 cc. (0.63 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water. When the mixture is stirred the amine soon dissolves, leaving in suspension a small amount of fluffy material which is easily distinguishable from the original lumps. The solution is clarified by stirring (without heating) for five minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, and it is then filtered by suction. The pale yellow solution is treated with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to the boiling point, a second 50 cc. of the acid being added as the heating progresses. The color becomes somewhat fainter during this process. The vessel containing the hot solution is transferred to an ice bath and allowed to cool undisturbed, and the 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride soon separates in the form of large, perfectly colorless needles. When fairly cold, 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is cooled to 0° before collecting the product. The hydrochloride is washed with a cold solution of 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 cc. of water and dried on a filter paper at a temperature not above 30–35°. The yield is 70–83 g. (72–85 per cent of the theoretical amount). The material will remain colorless, or very nearly so, if protected from the light in storage. The fresh solution in water is only faintly colored and leaves but a trace of residue on filtration.

DESCRIPTION: After all the ester-ketone mixture has been added and the reaction has subsided, the ice bath is removed and replaced by a steam bath. The crust on the mixture is broken up and the mixture heated on a steam bath until all the sodium has reacted (30–60 minutes). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is poured with stirring onto 300 g. of crushed ice. Ninety-five milliliters of glacial acetic acid in 350 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes. The organic layer which separates is removed by means of a separatory funnel, and the water layer is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the original organic material, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. To the residue are added 150 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, after which it is allowed to cool to room temperature.

DESCRIPTION: (B) Ethyl Ethoxyacetate.—The ethoxyacetic acid, which should amount to about 125 g. (1.2 moles), is placed in a 750-cc. Erlenmeyer flask containing 230 cc. (3.9 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol. The flask is set in a pan filled with cold water, and dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. After the mixture becomes saturated it is allowed to stand twenty-four hours to ensure the completion of the reaction at room temperature. The solution is cooled, and a saturated solution of sodium carbonate is added cautiously and with stirring to avoid excessive foaming. The addition is continued until the mixture is faintly alkaline to litmus; an excess of sodium carbonate lowers the yield and should be avoided. The ester is extracted with four 100-cc. portions of ether; the extract is dried with 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled at ordinary pressure. The yield of ester boiling at 153–155° is 110–115 g. (55–58 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid, or 69–72 per cent based on the ethoxyacetic acid).

The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C (ice-water bath) and to it is added slowly 50 mL of cold water followed by approximately 50 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide solution, which basifies the reaction mixture to approximately pH 11. Saturated sodium chloride solution (approximately 50 mL) is added and the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The lower phase (CH2Cl2 solution) is removed and set aside while the upper, aqueous phase is extracted once with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solution is then filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave crude 2-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (1). The latter is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 110°C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7–13.3 g (81–85%).

DESCRIPTION: A. 1-Ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser provided with a calcium chloride tube, and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel equipped with a nitrogen inlet at the top. The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 500 mL of anhydrous toluene and 52.9 g (2.3 g-atom) of sodium cut in small pieces are introduced. The mixture is brought to reflux by means of a heating mantle and the sodium is finely pulverized by vigorous stirring.

DESCRIPTION: A. Coumarin dibromide. In a 1-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser fitted with a trap for hydrogen bromide, are placed 146 g. (1 mole) of coumarin and 200 ml. of chloroform. A solution of 160 g. (1 mole) of bromine in 85 ml. of chloroform is added dropwise to the well-stirred solution of coumarin at room temperature over a period of 3 hours. Excess bromine is removed by adding approximately 200 ml. of a 20% solution of sodium sulfite through the dropping funnel. The colorless chloroform layer is separated, washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, and dried over magnesium sulfate. After the mixture has stood for only a few minutes, the magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and the solution of the dibromide is evaporated to 100 ml. in a rapid stream of dry air. The coumarin dibromide is collected on a filter, and the mother liquor is evaporated nearly to dryness by an air blast. This mixture is filtered, and the slightly yellow mother liquor is evaporated to dryness.

DESCRIPTION: In a 12-l. flask, equipped with a low-temperature thermometer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, a solution of sulfurous acid is prepared by saturating 2.4 l. of water at 0–5° with sulfur dioxide from a cylinder. A brisk stream of the gas is continued while the cold diazonium salt solution is added in about 150-ml. portions over a 30-minute period and the temperature is maintained at 5–10°; the reaction mixture assumes a dark orange color. The cooling bath is removed, but sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture for an additional 30 minutes. After the mixture has been allowed to stand for 12 hours at room temperature, 3 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added; the o-hydrazinobenzoic acid hydrochloride separates at once. The mixture is chilled to 0–5° and filtered through a precooled Büchner funnel; the product is washed with two 50-ml. portions of ice-cold dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid. The yield is 50–51 g.

DESCRIPTION: In a large round-bottomed flask are placed 1.4 kg. of dried blood corpuscle paste and 4.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The flask is warmed on a steam bath until the protein has dissolved, and the mixture is boiled gently under reflux for eighteen to twenty hours. After the hydrolysate has been concentrated under reduced pressure to a thick paste, the distillation is continued with the slow addition of a liter of water, thus eliminating most of the excess hydrochloric acid. The residue is taken up in 8 l. of warm water, cooled, and neutralized to pH 4.4–4.6 (methyl orange or bromcresol green) by the addition of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. After the mixture has stood overnight, the precipitated pigment is removed by filtering through a large Büchner funnel fitted with two layers of filter paper and a 2-mm. layer of infusorial earth. The filtrate, which is dull red in color, is decolorized by warming and stirring for ten minutes with 60 g. of Norite.

DESCRIPTION: B. Tris(2-perfluorohexylethyl)phenyltin . Phenyltin trichloride (2.46 mL, 15 mmol) is dissolved in dry benzene (30 mL) in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask under argon at room temperature. The solution is slowly added to the 500-mL, three-necked flask containing the Grignard reagent at room temperature over 1 hr while stirring. The addition rate is adjusted to keep a constant temperature of about 25°C. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux overnight in an oil bath at 50°C, removed from the bath, and allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 4.5 hr with stirring. The reaction mixture is diluted with ether (100 mL), vacuum filtered into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, and hydrolyzed with saturated ammonium chloride solution (300 mL). Excess magnesium solid is also hydrolyzed with saturated ammonium chloride (100 mL) separately. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The water layer is removed, and the organic layer is washed three times with 3% sodium thiosulfate (3 × 200 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered under vacuum. The solvent is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotovap. The impure product is redissolved in ether (20 mL) and transferred to a 50-mL pear-shaped flask. The ether is removed under reduced pressure. Kugelrohr distillation is peformed to remove a dimer impurity of (C6F13CH2CH2CH2CH2C6F13) at 0.02 mm, 100-120°C for 5 hr. The residue is further purified by column filtration over silica (30 g) under pressure with hexane (1 L). The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure to leave 17.2 g (13.9 mmol, 93%) of pure compound as a colorless oil.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a special stirrer is placed 100 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 300 cc. of anhydrous methyl alcohol. The stirred mixture is heated for one hour in an oil bath held at 120° in order to effect solution of most of the sodium hydroxide. Stirring and heating are continued while 100 g. (0.59 mole) of ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate is added over a period of two hours. The resulting mixture is heated for one hour longer with the bath temperature at 120°. It is then diluted with 600 cc. of water and the condenser is arranged for distillation. The methyl alcohol is removed by distillation until a thermometer immersed in the boiling solution reads 98–100°. The residual aqueous solution is vigorously stirred, and exactly 210 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is carefully added drop by drop from a dropping funnel. The hot acid solution is treated with 2–4 g. of Darco and is filtered through a heated Büchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath. The pimelic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel and is crystallized from 100 cc. of boiling water for each 45 g. of acid. After drying in the air the acid melts at 103.5–104° and weighs 65–73 g. The mother liquors from the hydrolysis and recrystallization are combined and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The resulting solid is extracted with two 500-cc. portions of acetone. The acetone is distilled from a steam bath, and the residual crude pimelic acid is recrystallized from the minimum quantity of benzene, yielding an additional 10–12 g. of pure material. The total yield is 75–83 g. (80–88 per cent of the theoretical amount based on ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate; 47–54 per cent based on cyclohexanone).

DESCRIPTION: When the addition of the nitric acid solution is complete, the reaction mixture is removed from the ice bath and allowed to stand at room temperature for two hours. The flask is then warmed, with shaking, to 50° on a water bath and maintained at that temperature for ten minutes. The cooled reactants are then poured slowly into 800 cc. of ice water and well stirred. About 40 g. of sodium chloride is added, and the aqueous layer is decanted and extracted with 200–250 cc. of a commercial grade of ether. The ethereal extract is added to the residual nitromesitylene, and this ethereal solution is washed with three or four 30-cc. portions of a 10–15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the water extract is distinctly alkaline. The ether is then distilled from a steam bath. The residue, after the addition of about 150 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, is steam-distilled until a test sample of the distillate is clear and free of oil drops. The steam distillation requires about three hours, during which time 1.5 l. of distillate is collected. The nitromesitylene settles to the bottom of the distillate. The water is decanted through a filter paper, and the residue is dissolved in 30 cc. of ether. The filter paper, if it contains any solid particles, is washed with 10 cc. of ether, and the two fractions are combined and placed in a 150-cc. distilling flask with a water-cooled receiver. After removal of the ether on a steam bath, the yellow residue is distilled with a free flame. All but 0.5 to 1.5 g. of material distils at 243–250°, and the distillate, which weighs 47 g., solidifies on cooling. The yellow crystalline product is purified by dissolving in 25 cc. of commercial methyl alcohol and cooling with stirring in a bath of ice and salt. The crystals are then filtered on a small Büchner funnel and washed twice with 5-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. From the wash alcohol, by exactly the same procedure, there is obtained 6–8 g. of crude crystals boiling at 243–249°. This material yields on crystallization 4 g. of pure nitromesitylene. The pure nitromesitylene, which has a light yellow color, melts at 43–44°. The yield is 41–42 g. (74–76 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a tube to carry off hydrogen chloride and acetic acid vapors, are placed 915 cc. of glacial acetic acid, 327 g. (5 gram atoms) of zinc dust, and 352 g. (1 mole) of cetyl iodide (m.p. 20–22°) (p. 322). The mixture is saturated with dry hydrogen chloride and then stirred and heated on a steam bath. At the end of every five hours of heating, the mixture is again saturated with hydrogen chloride. After the reaction has proceeded for twenty-five hours, the mixture is allowed to cool, and the layer of hexadecane, which rises to the top of the reaction mixture, is separated. The residue is poured into 3 l. of water and filtered on a Büchner funnel to remove the zinc dust. The zinc dust is washed with 500 cc. of water and then with 250 cc. of ether. The combined water layers are extracted with two 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and added to the hexadecane, and the resulting solution is washed with two 250-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide and then with water until free of alkali. The ether solution is dried with 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled from a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. The yield of n-hexadecane boiling at 156–158°/14 mm. and melting at 16–17° is 192 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: A. Glutaric acid. To the solution of monoamide is added 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is heated under reflux in the hood for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is dried by brief heating on a steam bath at reduced pressure. The residual crystalline solid is broken up, ground in a mortar, and extracted with four 200-ml. portions of boiling chloroform. The combined hot extracts are filtered by gravity through a fluted paper on a heated funnel and then concentrated to about 400 ml. After the solution has been cooled in water to effect crystallization, the glutaric acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with cold chloroform, and dried. The yield of slightly discolored glutaric acid, suitable for many purposes, is 105–110 g. (79.5–83.5%), m.p. 95–97°.

DESCRIPTION: At the end of the heating period the reaction mixture is cooled to about 100–110° (at lower temperatures a gelatinous precipitate separates) and is then poured into 150 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. An additional 100 ml. of water is used to rinse the reaction flask. The diluted mixture is acidified to Congo red by slow addition of 6N hydrochloric acid as the mixture is stirred vigorously to ensure conversion of any precipitated potassium salt to the free acid. The mixture is then cooled by tap water for at least 30 minutes. The white precipitate is collected by suction filtration, transferred to a beaker, and is heated with about 250 ml. of water until the solid has melted. As the mixture is cooled, it is stirred vigorously by hand until the oil has resolidified. After the mixture has been cooled again, the precipitated acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried. The yield of hendecanedioic acid, m.p. 110.5–112°, is 28.5–30.6 g.

DESCRIPTION: B. Hexacarbonyl(1-methyl-2-propynylium)dicobalt tetrafluoroborate (1). A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a stopper, and a gas inlet T-tube that is attached to a mineral oil bubbler is flame-dried under a flow of nitrogen. The flask is charged with 200 mL of dry dichloromethane and 13.0 g (0.185 mol) of 3-butyn-2-ol. After the mixture is stirred for 15 min, 65.0 g (0.19 mol) of dicobalt octacarbonyl is added in portions over a few minutes while maintaining a slow stream of nitrogen. Vigorous gas evolution (carbon monoxide!) is observed. The mixture is stirred for 4–5 hr, and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure (20–25 mm). The residual solid (alkyne)Co2(CO6) complex is dissolved in 40 mL of propionic anhydride under nitrogen and cooled to −45°C in a dry ice–acetonitrile bath. Tetrafluoroboric acid–dimethyl etherate (37.3 g, 0.28 mol) is added with stirring. After 30 min, 600–800 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added with continuous stirring.

The resulting suspension is stirred and cooled to −72° to −78° in a 4-l. acetone–dry ice bath. A solution of n-butyllithium (0.110 mole) in hexane is added over a 30-minute period such that the temperature does not exceed −70°. The mixture is then allowed to warm to −60° over an additional 1.5 hours. Four liters of dry, thiophene-free benzene is added to the pentachlorophenyllithium solution over a 1-hour interval, during which the temperature rises to ca. + 10°. The mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of at least 14 hours and then is heated at +30° for another 2 hours to ensure complete reaction. A 10-g. portion of solid ammonium chloride is added, and 15 minutes later the contents of the flask are filtered through 20 g. of Celite. The volume of the filtrate is reduced to 75 ml. with a rotary evaporator, and 100 g. of alumina is added to the concentrate in a 250-ml. flask. The rotary evaporation is continued until the weight remains constant and a free-flowing consistency is attained. The material is placed on a column packed with 800 g. of alumina and eluted with low-boiling petroleum ether. Fractions of ca. 200 ml. are collected and analyzed by GC or TLC ((Note 6)), with the appropriate fractions combined and evaporated, providing 16.9–17.5 g.

The flask is charged with 3.36 g. (0.140 mole) of sodium hydride, the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added. The suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath under a static nitrogen atmosphere as a solution of 14.02 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-acetylcyclohexanone in 15 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added over a 15-minute period. The formation of the sodium enolate is complete when hydrogen evolution ceases and a thick suspension has developed. Stirring and cooling are continued for 20 minutes, after which a solution of 20.1 g. (0.105 mole) of benzeneselenenyl chloride in 20 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is rapidly added. The contents of the flask are stirred at 0° for 15 minutes and poured into a beaker containing a magnetically stirred mixture of 200 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) diethyl ether-pentane, 50 ml. of aqueous 7% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 50 g. of ice. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 50 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) ether–pentane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried by filtration through a cone of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure gives 29.2–30 g. of crude, solid 2-acetyl-2-phenylselenocyclohexanone which is used in Part B without purification.

DESCRIPTION: With the stirrer in rapid motion phosgene is passed into the solution of anthranilic acid at such a rate that bubbles of gas escape slowly into the ammonia scrubber (about two bubbles per second). Isatoic anhydride appears as a precipitate soon after the stream of phosgene is started. The temperature rises but is prevented from exceeding 50° by regulation of the rate at which phosgene is introduced. The stream of phosgene is continued for 2–4 hours, or until the rate of absorption is clearly much decreased. The flask is disconnected, and residual phosgene is blown out by passing a current of air through the mixture. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel and is washed with three 500-ml. portions of cold water. The first crop amounts to 54–56 g.

The yellow quinone that has separated is then filtered with suction and is washed, first with 200 ml. of water, then with 100 ml. of ethanol, and finally with 50 ml. of ether. The yield of air-dried product (m.p. 209–210°) is 36.5–37.5 g. (94–96%). The over-all yield for both steps is 90%.

Distillation is carried out until 165 ml. of distillate has been collected. The still head reaches a temperature of about 90°. The distillate is washed with two 250-ml. portions of water and dried by shaking gently for 5 minutes with 5 g. of 8-mesh calcium chloride. The product is decanted from the calcium chloride and distilled through a 30-cm. packed column to give 107–113 g. (68–72%) of 1-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutene, b.p. 52–53°, n25D 1.3614–1.3619.

DESCRIPTION: A. 2-tert-Butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (1). To an oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, condenser, and a 250-mL dropping funnel, are added triphosgene (14.8 g, 0.05 mol), and anhydrous toluene (120 mL). The mixture is kept under argon and cooled to ≈10°C with the aid of an external ice bath. A solution of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylurea (18.0 mL, 0.15 mol) in dry toluene (50 mL) is slowly added to the mixture over 30 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and stirring of the mixture is continued for an additional hour. During this time a white precipitate forms. tert-Butylamine (47.3 mL, 0.45 mol) is slowly added to the mixture over 30 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated under reflux for 5 hr and then cooled to room temperature. Anhydrous ether (200 mL) is added and the white precipitate is quickly removed by filtration. The precipitate is washed with a further quantity of anhydrous ether (300 mL) and immediately dissolved in aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide solution (100 mL). The mixture is then extracted with three portions of ether (300 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (potassium carbonate), filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resulting colorless liquid is purified by distillation (bp 88–89°C/36 mm) to afford 18.7 g (73%) of 2-tert-butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine 1.

DESCRIPTION: For purification, 200 g. of the crude product is suspended in 1 l. of hot water and treated with a solution of 88 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water. The solution is stirred mechanically and the isatin passes into solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then added, with stirring, until a slight precipitate appears. This requires about 290–300 cc. of an acid made by diluting one volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with two volumes of water. The mixture is then filtered at once, the precipitate is rejected, and the filtrate is made acid to Congo red paper with hydrochloric acid. The solution is then cooled rapidly, and the isatin which separates is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The pure product thus obtained weighs 150–170 g. and and melts at 197–200° (corr.).

A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a good magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, water-cooled condenser, and a fritted gas inlet tube. The outlet of the condenser is attached to a tared −78°C cold trap and the inlet tube is connected via flexible tubing to a graduated −78°C cold trap into which 60 mL (96 g, 0.64 mol) of hexafluoropropene has been condensed under nitrogen. The flask is charged with 3 g of potassium fluoride and is flamed gently under vacuum. The apparatus is cooled while purging with nitrogen. Sulfur (23 g, 0.72 mol) and 200 mL of dry dimethylformamide are then added. The reaction mixture is heated to 40–45°C with stirring. The heat source is removed, the stopcock on the trap containing the hexafluoropropene is opened, and the trap is gently thawed. The rate of hexafluoropropene bubbling into the reaction mixture is adjusted to about 0.6 mL (1 g) / min by cooling or warming the trap containing the hexafluoropropene,(Note 4),(Note 5). When all the hexafluoropropene has been added, the reaction mixture is cooled to −20°C to −30°C and quickly filtered under suction. The filtercake is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and is allowed to melt. Water (50 mL) is added, and the mixture is filtered.

DESCRIPTION: A stir bar is added to the flask and the solids are suspended in 150 mL of toluene with mixing at approximately 400 rpm. After a water-cooled reflux condenser is attached to the flask, the mixture is then heated to 110 °C (bath temperature) in an oil bath. After a few minutes at this temperature, the solids dissolve completely to afford a clear colorless solution. Heating is discontinued and the stirred mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature (20 °C) overnight while still immersed in the oil bath. The cooled heterogeneous mixture is vacuum filtered (water aspirator) through filter paper on a porcelain Büchner funnel. The solids are rinsed with toluene (2 × 10 mL) and then dried on the filter for 15 min. The solids are transferred to a 250-mL pear-shaped flask and dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) until a constant mass of 10.8–10.9 g (51.7–52.2 mmol, 76–77% yield, 89–90% recovery) is observed.

DESCRIPTION: A. N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone.2 3 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet adaptor, a low temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (1.1 L) and triphenylphosphine (42.1 g, 160 mmol,). The triphenylphosphine is dissolved with stirring and the flask is then cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Distilled dimethyl azodicarboxylate (17.7 mL, 160 mmol, d = 1.33 g/mL at 25°C) is added dropwise with a syringe over 10 min (Caution,). The resulting pale yellow solution is stirred at −75° to −78°C for 10 min, at which point a milky white slurry is obtained. The rubber septum on the flask is quickly replaced with a 1-L, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine (38.3 g, 160 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (240 mL),, which is added dropwise to the mixture over 30 min. After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at −75° to −77°C for 20 min, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is slowly warmed with stirring to room temperature over 2.5 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 35°C. The residual pale yellow syrup is dried briefly (15 min) under high vacuum (~0.2 mm) and suspended in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 20 mL). Ethyl acetate (30 mL) is added to give a solution which is applied to a 10 × 23-cm column of flash silica gel4 (800 g) packed in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1). The flask and the sides of the column are rinsed with additional ethyl acetate (20 mL), and this is added to the column which is then eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 2.6 L). The solvent is changed to hexane/ethyl acetate (3/2) and 500-mL fractions are collected. Concentration of fractions 6–10 on a rotary evaporator gives 15.5 g (44%) of analytically pure N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone. Fractions 11–14 contain slightly impure β-lactone.

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. beaker on a steam bath, 155 g. (0.78 mole) of p-acetaminobenzenesulfinic acid is suspended in 310 ml. of water. The suspension is stirred by hand and warmed gently while it is neutralized by the addition of a solution of 31.5 g. of sodium hydroxide in 125 ml. of water. The solution is then transferred to a 2-l. flask and the bulk of the water is removed under the vacuum of a good water pump; 330–350 ml. of water is removed during 1.5 hours. During this time, the solid salt begins to separate. When bumping becomes severe, the flask is cooled by immersion in an ice bath for 30 minutes, and the salt is filtered with suction. The filtrate is concentrated as before, the product being added to the first crop. The second filtrate, on concentration, yields a less pure salt which may be worked up separately. The yields are 107–124 g. (63–73%) of the first crop, 25–34 g. (15–20%) of the second crop, and 12–17 g. (7–10%) of material of inferior grade.

DESCRIPTION: [18]Annulene is best stored in benzene–ether solution in the refrigerator. The crystals can also be kept for some time in the refrigerator, small crystals being less stable than large ones.2 Material that has decomposed to some extent may be purified as follows. The substance (300 mg.) is broken up with a spatula and heated with 30 ml. of benzene, and the insoluble material is removed by filtration. The filtrate is poured onto a chromatography column (20 × 1.8 cm.), prepared with 35 g. of alumina and benzene. The column is washed with benzene until the eluate is colorless. Polymeric material is retained at the top of the column. The eluent is concentrated to approximately 6 ml., diluted with 20 ml. of ether, and cooled in an ice–salt bath. The resulting crystals of [18]annulene are collected on a sintered glass funnel, washed with 3 ml. of cold (−20°) ether, and dried in air for a few minutes.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure. At first the solvent may be distilled rapidly, but, after the mixture becomes syrupy, the distillation should be carried out below 30° until the residue is almost solid. At a pressure of 10 mm. the concentration requires about 2 hours. The residue is diluted with 500 ml. of cold water, which should be added in several portions with thorough shaking to break up all the lumps. The product is collected on a filter and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid until the filtrate comes through colorless.

DESCRIPTION: On cooling, the filtrate yields about 175 g. of p-iodobenzoic acid. Concentration of the mother liquor yields crystals which are contaminated with mercuric iodide. The latter may be removed by grinding the crystals in a mortar with water and enough sodium iodide or potassium iodide to destroy the red color of the mercuric iodide. The mixture is filtered and the crystals are washed with a little sodium iodide solution and then with water. The washed p-iodobenzoic acid melts at 266–267°. The total yield is 150–170 g.

DESCRIPTION: The gas inlet tube is replaced by a dropping funnel protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Isocaproyl chloride (84.7 g., 0.63 mole) is added to the reaction mixture with stirring over a period of 20 minutes. The dropping funnel is replaced by the gas inlet tube (inlet tube wiped with a dry towel), and, with stirring, acetylene is bubbled just below the surface of the mixture at a rate noticeably above the saturation rate. After 15 minutes to 1 hour the rate of absorption of acetylene suddenly becomes very rapid, and the acetylene is passed through as rapidly as it is absorbed. The introduction of acetylene is continued for 30 minutes after the rapid absorption (which lasts 1–2 hours) has subsided.

DESCRIPTION: B. erythrol-1-(3-Hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylpropanoyl)piperidine. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with nitrogen. One neck is connected with a balloon charged with nitrogen, and the other neck is capped with a rubber septum. Into the flask are placed 50 mL of trifluoroacetic acid and 11.9 g of 1-(2-benzoylpropanoyl)piperidine (48.7 mmol) prepared as described in Part A; then the flask is immersed in an ice–water bath. To the flask is added 7.3 g of dimethylphenylsilane (8.24 mL, 54 mmol) over a 5-min period with the aid of a 10-mL syringe, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 4 hr in the ice bath. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 200 mL of water. After the organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The crude oil is placed in a 200-mL, one-necked flask and dissolved in 100 mL of methanolic 1 M sodium hydroxide. The solution is stirred for 1.5 hr at ambient temperature with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual oil is subjected to column chromatography using 100 g of silica gel. After the first fraction (800t mL) of hexane is eluted, the second fraction, eluted with 500 mL of diethyl ether, is collected and concentrated. Recrystallization of the resulting oil from diethyl ether–hexane gives 10.2 g of material, mp 85–86°C. The yield is 90%.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a gas-inlet tube, a rubber septum, a reflux condenser connected to a mineral oil bubbler, and a sealed mechanical stirrer. The system is flamed with a Bunsen burner as it is flushed with dry nitrogen. The reaction vessel is cooled under nitrogen in an ice bath, and 7.25 g. (0.125 mole) of 2-propen-1-ol, 70 ml. of pentane, and 1.16 g. (0.0100 mole) of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-ethanediamine are added successively through the rubber septum with a syringe. While maintaining a positive nitrogen pressure, 180 ml. of 1.5 M (0.270 mole) n-butyllithium in pentane is added from a syringe over a 20-minute period. The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour. The ice bath is then restored, the gas-inlet tube replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 70 ml. of water is added, cautiously at first, and then more rapidly after the exothermic reaction ceases. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the pentane layer is washed with a 10-ml. portion of 3 N hydrochloric acid, then two 10-ml. portions of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. Distillation of the residual oil through a short-path distillation apparatus yields 9.3–9.6 g. (64–66%) of 2-methyl-1-hexanol, b.p. 166–167° and.

DESCRIPTION: A. 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2-propenylthio)thiazole. A solution of 11.9 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-mercapto-2-thiazoline in 60 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is prepared in a 200-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 25-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. Allyl bromide (12.1 g., 8.74 ml., 0.100 mole) is added in one portion at room temperature, and 5 minutes later 10.1 g. (13.9 ml., 0.100 mole) of triethylamine is added dropwise over a 10-minute period. After the dropping funnel has been replaced with a condenser, the mixture is refluxed gently for 4 hours. The resulting slurry is cooled and filtered, removing triethylamine hydrobromide, which is washed with 20 ml. of fresh tetrahydrofuran, and the combined organic solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of diethyl ether, and this solution is washed with three 20-ml. portions of 5% aqueous potassium hydroxide and two 20-ml. portions of water. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the ethereal solution is filtered and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Vacuum distillation of the residue gives 10.9–11.1 g.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.—In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide. The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234–238°, amounts to 80–90 g. (66–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.

DESCRIPTION: (B) Homoveratric Acid.—In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask are placed 250 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 76 g. (0.36 mole) of methyl homoveratrate. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the mixture is boiled gently. The saponification proceeds rapidly, and the ester layer disappears after about ten minutes. The mixture is refluxed gently for twenty minutes longer, after which the solution is cooled in an ice bath and then poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 350 g. of ice. Crystals of the hydrate of homoveratric acid separate at once. After standing for about thirty minutes the crystalline product is filtered with suction and washed on the filter with two 25-cc. portions of ice water. The crystals are pressed thoroughly on the filter, pulverized, and allowed to stand overnight in a vacuum desiccator containing soda lime (to remove residual hydrochloric acid) and calcium chloride. The yield in the saponification is almost quantitative and amounts to 70 g. (55 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone). This product melts at 96–97° and contains traces of sodium chloride. For purification it is dissolved in 350 cc. of hot benzene and the solution is filtered. To the hot filtrate is added 150 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 70–80°), and the solution is covered with a watch glass and allowed to cool slowly. After standing for several hours (preferably overnight) in a cool place, the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with a cold solution of 35 cc. of benzene and 15 cc. of ligroin, followed by 50 cc. of cold petroleum ether. The solvent is removed as completely as possible by pressing on the filter and finally by allowing the product to stand in a vacuum desiccator. The purified homoveratric acid weighs 65 g. (51 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone) and melts sharply at 98°.

DESCRIPTION: The crude aminonaphthol is washed into a beaker containing a solution at 30° of 2 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate and 53 cc. (0.63 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water. When the mixture is stirred the amine soon dissolves, leaving in suspension a small amount of fluffy material which is easily distinguishable from the original lumps. The solution is clarified by stirring (without heating) for five minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, and it is then filtered by suction. The pale yellow solution is treated with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to the boiling point, a second 50 cc. of the acid being added as the heating progresses. The color becomes somewhat fainter during this process. The vessel containing the hot solution is transferred to an ice bath and allowed to cool undisturbed, and the 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride soon separates in the form of large, perfectly colorless needles. When fairly cold, 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is cooled to 0° before collecting the product. The hydrochloride is washed with a cold solution of 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 cc. of water and dried on a filter paper at a temperature not above 30–35°. The yield is 70–83 g. (72–85 per cent of the theoretical amount). The material will remain colorless, or very nearly so, if protected from the light in storage. The fresh solution in water is only faintly colored and leaves but a trace of residue on filtration.

DESCRIPTION: A. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (I). In a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the bottom, and a dropping funnel, is placed 2 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and when the temperature falls below 10° a solution of 220 g. (2 moles) of resorcinol in 260 g. (2 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate is added dropwise. The mixture is stirred, and the temperature is kept below 10° by means of ice and salt. After all the solution has been added (about 2 hours) the reaction mixture is set aside for 12–24 hours without further cooling. The reaction mixture is now poured with vigorous stirring into a mixture of 4 kg. of ice and 6 l. of water. The precipitate is collected on a filter and washed with three 50-ml. portions of cold water. The crude product is then dissolved in 3 l. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the solution is filtered, and the substituted coumarin is reprecipitated from the filtrate by the slow addition of dilute (1:10) sulfuric acid until the solution is acid to litmus. About 1.1 l. of dilute sulfuric acid is required. During the neutralization, the reaction mixture must be well stirred. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with four 50-ml. portions of cold water, and dried. The yield of 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin is 290–320 g. (82–90%). It is sufficiently pure for use in the next step but may be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol using about 15 ml. of ethanol for 5 g. of product.

DESCRIPTION: 1,2,3-Triphenylcyclopropenium bromide. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, glass stopper, and rubber septum, is flushed with argon and charged with a solution of diphenylacetylene (3.92 g, 0.022 mol) and potassium tert-butoxide (9.97 g, 0.089 mol) in dry benzene (100 mL). Efficient magnetic stirring is initiated, and 5.8 mL of α,α-dichlorotoluene (7.2 g, 0.045 mol) is added dropwise over ~5 min via a syringe under argon. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for 3 hr during which time the precipitate dissolves. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of water is added to remove inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with portions of ether (2 × 50-mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is saturated with anhydrous hydrogen bromide, whereupon a light yellow precipitate forms that is collected to afford 6.8–7.2 g (89–93%) of essentially pure triphenylcyclopropenium bromide.

While maintaining a positive nitrogen pressure, 180 ml. of 1.5 M (0.270 mole) n-butyllithium in pentane is added from a syringe over a 20-minute period. The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour. The ice bath is then restored, the gas-inlet tube replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 70 ml. of water is added, cautiously at first, and then more rapidly after the exothermic reaction ceases. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the pentane layer is washed with a 10-ml. portion of 3 N hydrochloric acid, then two 10-ml. portions of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. Distillation of the residual oil through a short-path distillation apparatus yields 9.3–9.6 g. (64–66%) of 2-methyl-1-hexanol, b.p. 166–167° and.

DESCRIPTION: B. Lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two glass stoppers and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a gas inlet connected to an argon-vacuum manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. After evacuating and backfilling with argon three times, the flask is charged with substituted aniline 1 (11.3 g, 63.7 mmol) and n-hexane (220 mL) under argon purge. The solution is cooled to −78 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath and a solution of n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 48 mL, 76.8 mmol) is added via the dropping funnel over 10 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 12 h during which time it is gradually warmed to room temperature; a white precipitate forms upon warming. The dropping funnel is replaced by a distillation head and condenser and all volatiles are removed under vacuum (approximately 7.5 mmHg) at room temperature without exposing the contents to the open atmosphere. Then ether (25 mL) and n-hexane (50 mL) are added to the remaining viscous liquid causing further precipitation of a white solid. The resulting suspension is kept at −30 °C under argon for 12 h. The white solids of lithium anilide etherate (2•Et2O) formed are collected by filtration under argon, washed with cold n-hexane (2 × 10 mL) and dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) to give lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate as colorless crystals (9.41 g, 57%). The filtrate is concentrated under vacuum to approximately half of its volume and slowly cooled to −78 °C to give a second crop of the product which is isolated by filtration under argon as described above (3.48 g, 21%).

DESCRIPTION: A dry, 500-mL, three-necked flask appropriately shaped to accommodate the horn of an ultrasonic processor is equipped with a thermometer and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which a nitrogen inlet is attached. A nitrogen atmosphere is established in the flask, which is charged with 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), 3.04 g (0.125 mol) of magnesium (Mg) turnings, 32.5 g (0.100 mol) of tributyltin chloride, and a small piece of iodine (optional), and then immersed in an ice-salt bath. After the temperature of the solution falls below 15°C, 13.4 mL (0.120 mol) of 1-chloro-3-methyl-2-butene in 50 mL of THF is added dropwise over 30–60 min while maintaining the temperature at less than 20°C under sonication at an output power of 30–75W. After the addition is complete, sonication is continued for a further 30–45 min to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture is poured into 400 g of ice water and the mixture is extracted with three 100-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are washed with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under aspirator pressure to yield a colorless oil.

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel is placed 100 g. (0.58 mole) of p-bromotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 136). The stem of the dropping funnel and the thermometer should reach nearly to the bottom of the flask. The upper end of the condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap. The flask is heated with stirring in an oil bath until the temperature of the liquid reaches 105°. The liquid is illuminated with an unfrosted 150-watt tungsten lamp, and 197 g. (61.8 cc., 1.23 moles) of bromine is added slowly from the separatory funnel. About one-half of the bromine is added during the first hour, during which time the temperature is kept at 105–110°.

DESCRIPTION: After all the sodium has dissolved, a mixture of 115 g. (0.72 mole) of diethyl malonate and 60 g. (0.60 mole) of methyl crotonate is added from the separatory funnel. This addition is made as rapidly as is consistent with keeping the exothermic reaction under control. After the exothermic reaction has subsided, the mixture is heated for 1 hour under reflux with stirring. An oil bath is recommended for heating. At the end of the heating period the condenser is changed to a position for distilling, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised sufficiently to distil alcohol fairly rapidly from the stirred mixture. Distillation is continued until most of the alcohol has been distilled. There is left a residue of the sodio derivative of triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate. If water is added to obtain the free ester, considerable heat is generated and cooling must be adequate to prevent partial hydrolysis of the ester by the alkali liberated. For present purposes there is no advantage in attempting isolation of the ester, and the residue is processed as described below.

DESCRIPTION: Finally, the sides of the addition funnel are rinsed with approximately 10 mL of ether using a 20-mL plastic syringe, and the ethereal solution of iodine is added dropwise over 25 min to the stirring slurry of acetylide. Upon completion of the addition, a substantial mass of iodine is scraped from the tip of the addition funnel into the reaction vessel using a spatula. The cold bath is removed, and the solution is allowed to warm to 20 &Degree;C over 2.5 h. A septum is removed, and distilled water (100 mL) is added cautiously through the open neck. The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the organic phase is isolated. The aqueous phase is extracted with hexanes (100 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with two 200-mL portions of water, followed by 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), filtered through a Büchner funnel (150 mmHg), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear, light yellow oil that is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottom flask and distilled under vacuum using a short-path still to give 19.9 g (84%) of iodoalkyne 4 as a clear, colorless liquid.

(3.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings. A solution of 459 g. (6 moles) of dry, freshly distilled allyl chloride in 2.4 l. of anhydrous ether is added to the flask through the dropping funnel in the following manner: A 100- to 200-ml. portion of the solution and a small crystal of iodine are added, and the mixture is warmed, if necessary, until the reaction starts. The remainder of the solution is added with stirring and cooling in an ice bath as rapidly as possible without loss of material through the condenser. By sponging the upper part of the flask with ice water from the cooling bath, the addition can be completed in 1–1.5 hours. When the addition is complete, the thick slurry is allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 hours with stirring for as much of that period as is practicable. The flask is again cooled in an ice bath, and a cold 5% solution of hydrochloric acid is added through the dropping funnel until the evolution of heat has practically ceased and the magnesium chloride is in solution. The mechanical stirrer is started again when the mixture becomes sufficiently fluid.

DESCRIPTION: (C) Diphenyl Triketone.—The 41.5 g. (0.16 mole) of triketone hydrate is distilled in vacuum from a Claisen flask heated by means of a sand bath. A distilling flask is used as a receiver, and no condenser is necessary. The neck of the receiving flask must be warmed, however, to prevent clogging of the apparatus by crystallization of the distillate. The anhydrous triketone distils at 174–176°/2 mm. as a reddish oil that solidifies to a light yellow, crystalline mass. This is dissolved in 70 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–120°); it separates on cooling in light yellow needles which melt at 68–70°. The yield is 35 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the triketone hydrate; 59 per cent based on the dibenzoylmethane).

DESCRIPTION: To 3600 g. (1960 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, in a 5-l. flask placed in an empty water bath, is added 360 g. (1.6 moles) of technical trinitrotoluene, while the mixture is stirred mechanically. Sodium dichromate is now added in small quantities, with constant stirring, until the temperature of the mixture reaches 40°; the empty water bath is now filled with cold water and the addition of sodium dichromate continued at such a rate that the temperature remains at 45–55°. In all, 540 g. (1.8 moles) of sodium dichromate is added, the addition taking one to two hours. When all has been added, the mixture, which has now become very thick, is stirred for two hours at 45–55°, and poured into a crock containing 4 kg. of crushed ice. The insoluble trinitrobenzoic acid is filtered off and carefully washed with cold water until free from chromium salts. On drying it weighs 320–340 g.

DESCRIPTION: The clear filtrate, which has only a pale yellow color, is now run, with stirring, into the cuprous chloride solution in a 12-l. flask, while the temperature is kept at 25–30°. A somewhat sticky precipitate first forms, which later becomes crystalline; nitrogen is evolved in a continuous stream. The addition requires about thirty minutes. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath under an efficient reflux condenser until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. It is then distilled in a current of steam (using the apparatus described on p. 479) until no more chloronitrobenzene passed over; 9–10 l. of distillate collects during this process. When quite cold, the water is decanted off, and the solid shaken with 1–2 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50°. The mixture is again allowed to cool, and the light yellow alkaline solution is decanted from the solid product, which is then collected on a filter, washed with a little cold water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. It boils completely at 116–117°/12 mm. or 124–125°/18 mm., and the distillate solidifies to a pale yellow solid which melts at 44–45° and weighs 430–450 g. (68–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: The cold cuprous cyanide solution is now chilled to 0–5° by the addition of ice, and 1 l. of benzene is poured on the surface. To this mixture is slowly added the cold neutralized diazonium solution. During the addition, which occupies about thirty minutes, such vigorous stirring is maintained that the benzene on the surface is constantly drawn to the stirrer, and the temperature is maintained at 0–5° by occasionally adding ice. As soon as the diazonium solution comes into contact with the cuprous cyanide, a dark yellow, oily precipitate is formed which at once begins to give off nitrogen; the resulting nitrile is taken up by the benzene as soon as it is formed. When all has been added, the temperature is held at 0–5° for thirty minutes longer, and then is allowed to rise to that of the room (20–25°), which usually requires about three hours.

DESCRIPTION: After the addition of the bromine is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for about one hour. It then has a light yellow color. The solution is washed with water and then with two 500-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to remove any dissolved hydrobromic acid. The solution is dried over calcium chloride and filtered. The carbon tetrachloride is distilled through a good column until the temperature at the top of the column reaches about 120°. When the carbon tetrachloride has distilled, the oil is likely to turn dark and give off fumes.

DESCRIPTION: Two hundred grams of sodium nitrite is dissolved in 400 cc. of water in a 2-l. beaker, and 40 g. of copper powder is added. The mixture is stirred with an efficient stirrer, and a suspension of the p-nitrophenyldiazonium fluoborate in 200 cc. of water is added slowly. Much frothing occurs, and 4–5 cc. of ether is added from time to time to break the foam. The reaction is complete when all the diazonium compound has been added. The product is filtered with suction, washed several times with water, twice with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and again with water. The solid is dried in an oven at 110°, powdered, and extracted with 300-cc., 200-cc., and 150-cc. portions of boiling benzene. The benzene is evaporated on a water bath, and the residue is crystallized from 120–150 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid. The resulting reddish yellow crystals, melting at 172–173°, weigh 28–34.5 g. (67–82 per cent yield). Recrystallization from alcohol yields pale yellow crystals melting at 173°.

DESCRIPTION: To a solution of 33 g. (0.5 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of distilled water in a 5-l. flask or other appropriate container fitted with a mechanical stirrer is added 80 g. (0.5 mole) of methyl hydrogen adipate. With continuous stirring a solution of 85 g. (0.5 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of distilled water is added rapidly (about 15 minutes). The precipitated methyl silver adipate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with methanol, and dried in an oven at 50–60°.

DESCRIPTION: B. Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propanoic acid . (Caution: Nitrogen oxides are highly toxic. This procedure should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood!) The crude mixture (461 g) of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin obtained from the above reaction is transferred to a 3-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask that is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, and an addition funnel. The transfer is most easily accomplished by melting the solid over a steam bath and pouring the mixture through a funnel directly into the reaction flask. The flask and its contents are heated to 70-80°C with a heating mantle, and a small portion (10-15 mL) of concentrated nitric acid is added with vigorous stirring to initiate the reaction. As the reaction begins, a large amount of dark orange-brown vapors appears. Stirring is continued, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed after the initial exothermic reaction subsides (usually within 15 min). The remaining nitric acid (660-680 mL) is added in 20-30-mL aliquots over 30 to 60 min so that nitrogen oxides are continually evolved but the reaction does not become violent. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is carefully removed and left in the hood to air out and is replaced by a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is heated at 70-80°C until the evolution of nitrogen oxides is no longer evident. At this point, the biphasic reaction mixture is a cloudy yellow or white liquid. The warm reaction mixture is poured into a 4-L beaker and 2 L of cold water is added is to precipitate the tetrachloride/carboxylic acid product mixture. The beaker and its contents are allowed to stand for several hours at room temperature to ensure complete precipitation of the product; then the crude product mixture is filtered, washed with water, and the carboxylic acid is extracted as follows. The solid is pulverized, transferred to a 4-L beaker, and 2.5 L of 1 M sodium hydroxide is added with stirring. The liquid reaction mixture instantly becomes bright yellow, and the insoluble, white tetrachloride clumps on the sides of the beaker. Stirring is continued for 30-60 min whereupon the insoluble material is filtered and washed well with water. The combined washings and yellow, aqueous filtrate are acidified to pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (~250 mL). The carboxylic acid precipitates as a white solid that is easily filtered using two pieces of filter paper. The filtered and dried product thus obtained is a fine white powder (230 g, 65% yield). The aqueous filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride ; the extracts are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated to provide an additional 50-60 g of the desired acid. The crude, combined product (75% yield) can be used directly in the next step. Over several runs, the yield varies from 65-80%.

DESCRIPTION: A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, an addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet is charged with diphenyl disulfide (200 g, 917 mmol) and dichloromethane (320 mL). The addition funnel is charged with bromine (161 g, 52 mL, 1.01 mol). After the diphenyl disulfide dissolves, the nitrogen inlet is replaced with a calcium sulfate-packed drying tube, and the flask is fitted with a gas-dispersion tube. Ethylene (73.1 g, 2.61 mol), is slowly bubbled into the solution through a gas dispersion tube, and the bromine is added in 2–3-mL portions over 5 hr,. After addition of the bromine and ethylene is complete, the drying tube is replaced with the nitrogen inlet, and the flask is fitted with a clean addition funnel. The addition funnel is charged with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU, (306 g, 300 mL, 2.01 mol). DBU is added at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 55°C. After the DBU is added the reaction mixture is maintained at about 50°C for 15–18 hr. A 1.0 M ammonium hydroxide solution (600 mL) is added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 300 mL of dichloromethane. The organic fractions are combined, washed with water (600 mL), and dried with 10 g of magnesium sulfate. The mixture is filtered, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residue affords 162–184 g (65–74%) of phenyl vinyl sulfide, bp 80–84°C/11–12 mm,, and. The purity is greater than 98% by GC analysis,.

DESCRIPTION: B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200°. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240° (internal temperature 200°) and held there for 5 minutes. The flask is removed and cooled to 60–70°, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25° and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40–43 g. and melts at 58–59°. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2–4 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43–46.5 g. (72–76%).

DESCRIPTION: (A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.—In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide. The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234–238°, amounts to 80–90 g. (66–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5-cm., glass-coated, magnetic stirring bar, a Dewar condenser connected to a static argon line, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, is sealed with a rubber septum. After flushing with argon, 30 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and 19.5 ml. of 1.89 M (0.0368 mole) methyllithium solution are injected through the septum into the flask. A solution of 4.54 g. (0.0249 mole) of benzophenone in 35 ml. of anhydrous ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period. The mixture is allowed to stir for one half hour. The septum is removed, and the side arm is quickly adapted with Tygon® tubing leading through a tower of solid potassium hydroxide to a tank of anhydrous ammonia. After approximately 75 ml. of ammonia is slowly distilled into the flask, the tubing is removed, and 0.525 g. (0.0761 g.-atom, ca. 15 cm. added as 0.5 cm. pieces) of lithium wire is quickly added, and the flask is stoppered. After 15 minutes the dark blue color is discharged by the continuous addition of excess ammonium chloride (ca. 5 g. over a 15-minute period). The argon-inlet tube is disconnected, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is then partitioned between 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator yields 4.36–4.49 g. of crude product. Filtration of the product through 60 g. of Woelm alumina (Grade III) with 150 ml. of petroleum ether affords 4.16–4.31 g. (92–95%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, which on evaporative distillation in a Kügelrohr oven gives 4.12–4.21 g. (91–93%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, b.p. 100° (0.25 mm.), nD28 1.5691.

DESCRIPTION: C. Methyl 1-(1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)piperidin-4-yl)-2-oxoindoline-5-carboxylate (6). A 500-mL 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is fitted with a reflux condenser with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. The flask is charged with benzyl 4-(2-chloro-N-(4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)acetamido)-piperidine-1-carboxylate (5, 20.0 g, 44.6 mmol, 1 equiv), palladium acetate (1.01 g, 4.5 mmol, 0.1 equiv), 2-(di-t-butylphosphino)biphenyl (2.74 g, 9.2 mmol, 0.2 equiv), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (130 mL), and 2-propanol (32 mL). The light brown suspension is sparged subsurface with nitrogen gas for 15 min. Triethylamine (6.93 g, 68 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added via a 12-mL syringe and the mixture is sparged for an additional 5 min. The flask is placed in an oil bath at 80 °C and heated to an internal temperature of 74-76 °C for 2 h. The hot mixture is vacuum-filtered through a pad of Celite (25 g, pre-wetted with 2-MeTHF) in a 150-mL medium-porosity sintered glass funnel into a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The flask employed to carry out the reaction is rinsed with hot (75 °C) 2-MeTHF (100 mL) and used to wash the Celite pad. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature: 40 °C; 40 mmHg) to give an orange-brown solid (34 g). The flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) and 2-propanol (270 mL) is added. The stirred suspension is heated to a gentle reflux with a heating mantle to dissolve all solids, generating a nearly black solution. The heating mantle is turned off and the contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature over 2 h with stirring to give thick crystallization. The suspension is stirred for 4 h, then vacuum-filtered using a 150-mL medium-porosity sintered-glass funnel, washed with 2-propanol (2 x 30 mL, Note 22), then dried in a vacuum oven (70 mmHg) at 40 °C for 2 days to afford oxindole 6 as a gray solid (15.9 g, 87% yield).

DESCRIPTION: A. α-Bromo-α-phenylacetone. A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a water-cooled reflux condenser provided with a short inverted U-tube on the open end; the equipment is assembled in the hood. In the flask are placed 200 ml. of dry, thiophene-free benzene and 37 g. (36.89 ml., 0.276 mole) of phenylacetone. The stirrer is started, and 45 g. (14.42 ml., 0.28 mole) of reagent bromine is added dropwise during a period of 1 hour. The reaction mixture first becomes cloudy but changes to a clear orange-red solution by the time all the bromine is added. After the addition of bromine is complete, a rapid stream of dry nitrogen or carbon dioxide is passed through the solution by means of an inlet tube which now replaces the dropping funnel. The hydrogen bromide issuing from the inverted U-tube at the top of the condenser may be trapped in water in an Erlenmeyer flask or other container adjusted so that the water surface is about 1 cm. below the outlet of the tube. The reaction is complete when no more hydrogen bromide fumes can be detected in the gas issuing from the condenser. This operation requires 3–6 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes yellow to green. The benzene solution of α-bromo-α-phenylacetone is then transferred to a dry 500-ml. separatory funnel.

Anhydrous 2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid (25 g., 0.062 mole) is shaken with 185 ml. of anhydrous ethyl ether in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask until most of the solid dissolves. Then 15 g. (0.072 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride is added with shaking. The flask is fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube and stored overnight at room temperature. Any solid material is removed by filtration through a fritted-glass funnel into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the ethereal solution is concentrated to about one-half volume under reduced pressure at room temperature. The concentrated solution is allowed to stand overnight at 0° or below. The mother liquor is decanted from the crystals, which are then broken up, transferred to a fritted-glass funnel, washed quickly with petroleum ether (b.p. 35–55°), and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The mother liquor is again concentrated to one-half its volume under reduced pressure and a second crop of crystals collected. The total yield of 2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconyl chloride, melting at 68–71°, is 21–24 g. (80–92%), depending on the temperature of crystallization and.

DESCRIPTION: The residue is cooled and dissolved in 171 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4), and the solution is warmed for 30 minutes on the steam bath. It is immediately concentrated to complete dryness under reduced pressure. The flask is cooled, 300 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is refluxed for a short time to render the cake friable. The benzene is removed by decantation, and the cake is pulverized and extracted six times by refluxing it briefly with 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined benzene and ether extracts are filtered and concentrated to a volume of about 225 ml. In the mean-time the residual salts are extracted twice by refluxing them vigorously for a short time with 300-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene solutions are separated by decantation and added to the ether concentrate. The distillation is then continued until about two-thirds of the benzene has been removed, when the benzene solution is poured into a beaker and allowed to cool. The methylsuccinic acid is collected on a filter and is washed by shaking a suspension of it in 150 ml. of chloroform. The yield of air-dried product, melting at 110–111°, amounts to 87–93 g.

DESCRIPTION: B. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal.3 A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a gas inlet, an acetone–dry ice condenser with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets, a stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is placed in an acetone–dry ice bath and anhydrous ammonia is condensed into the flask (400 mL). A small piece of potassium metal (ca. 0.5 g) is added to the liquid ammonia and the cooling bath is removed. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.1 g) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature, at which time the deep blue color turns to gray. The remaining potassium metal (12.2 g, 0.31 g-atom total) is added in 0.5-g pieces over ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until a gray suspension results (20–30 min). A −50°C cooling bath is placed under the flask and the stopper is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalized dropping funnel containing 22.9 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane in 50 mL of anhydrous ether. This solution is added dropwise to the solution of freshly generated potassium amide over 15 min while the temperature is maintained at −50°C. After the solution is stirred for 3 hr at −50° to −60°C, solid ammonium chloride is added slowly to quench the excess potassium amide. The cooling bath is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During the course of the evaporation, anhydrous ether (350 mL total) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace the ammonia. After the temperature has reached 0°C, the brown reaction mixture is filtered by suction through a coarse fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts and the salts are washed twice with 25 mL of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (80–100 mm, 30°C) to constant weight (ca. 4–5 hr).

DESCRIPTION: A solution of 77.2 g. (0.5 mole) of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone in 500 ml. of dry ether is then placed in the dropping funnel and slowly added to the "mixed hydride" solution without much cooling so that gentle refluxing is maintained After addition of the ketone over a period of 45–60 minutes the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours more to complete the reduction. The excess hydride is destroyed by the addition of 10 ml. of dry t-butanol, and the mixture is refluxed for an additional 30 minutes. 4-t-Butylcyclohexanone (3 g.) in 20 ml. of dry ether is then added to the reaction mixture, which is refluxed for 4 hours more and allowed to stand overnight,. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and decomposed by successive additions of 100 ml. of water and 250 ml. of 10% aqueous sulfuric acid. The ethereal layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The extract is filtered from magnesium sulfate and the ether removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, weighing 85–87 g., solidifies in the flask and on gas chromatographic analysis (see) is found to contain 96% trans alcohol, 0.8% cis alcohol, and 3.2% ketone.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5-cm., glass-coated, magnetic stirring bar, a Dewar condenser connected to a static argon line, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, is sealed with a rubber septum. After flushing with argon, 30 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and 19.5 ml. of 1.89 M (0.0368 mole) methyllithium solution are injected through the septum into the flask. A solution of 4.54 g. (0.0249 mole) of benzophenone in 35 ml. of anhydrous ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period. The mixture is allowed to stir for one half hour. The septum is removed, and the side arm is quickly adapted with Tygon® tubing leading through a tower of solid potassium hydroxide to a tank of anhydrous ammonia. After approximately 75 ml. of ammonia is slowly distilled into the flask, the tubing is removed, and 0.525 g. (0.0761 g.-atom, ca. 15 cm. added as 0.5 cm. pieces) of lithium wire is quickly added, and the flask is stoppered. After 15 minutes the dark blue color is discharged by the continuous addition of excess ammonium chloride (ca. 5 g. over a 15-minute period). The argon-inlet tube is disconnected, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is then partitioned between 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator yields 4.36–4.49 g. of crude product. Filtration of the product through 60 g. of Woelm alumina (Grade III) with 150 ml. of petroleum ether affords 4.16–4.31 g. (92–95%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, which on evaporative distillation in a Kügelrohr oven gives 4.12–4.21 g. (91–93%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, b.p. 100° (0.25 mm.), nD28 1.5691.

DESCRIPTION: A. 5-(p-Hydroxybenzal)hydantoin. An intimate mixture of 6.11 g. (0.050 mole) of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 5.5 g. (0.055 mole) of hydantoin is placed in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask. Dry piperidine (10 ml.) is added, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube is fitted to the flask, and the flask is immersed in an oil bath so that the level of the reaction mixture is the same as the oil level of the bath. The oil bath is heated slowly to 130° and is held at this temperature for 30 minutes; foaming and gentle boiling occur. The reaction mixture is cooled, and 200 ml. of water at about 60° is added. The contents of the flask are stirred by means of a glass rod until a clear red solution is obtained. Any traces of tarry material are removed by filtration. The solution is cooled to room temperature, transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and acidified by dropwise addition of 20 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture stands at room temperature a few hours, and then the yellow precipitate of 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with cold water.

(3.4 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 1 l. (10.2 moles) of dry carbon tetrachloride. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath. The stirrer is started and when the temperature of the carbon tetrachloride has dropped to 10–15°, 50 cc. of dry thiophene-free benzene is added all at once. The reaction begins immediately as is indicated by the evolution of hydrogen chloride and a rising temperature. As soon as the reaction has started, salt is added to the ice in the cooling bath in order to get more effective cooling. When the temperature begins to fall after the reaction has started, a mixture of 550 cc. (a total of 6.7 moles) of thiophene-free benzene and 550 cc. (a total of 14.5 moles) of carbon tetrachloride is run in at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 5° and 10°. If efficient cooling is maintained, this addition requires one to two hours. The stirring is continued for about three hours after the benzene-carbon tetrachloride solution has been added, while the temperature is held at about 10°. The stirring is then discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand about twelve hours. During this time the mixture comes to room temperature.

DESCRIPTION: B. 2-Methyl-2-vinylcyclopentanone. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen inlet tube, and a rubber septum is kept under dry nitrogen. To this flask are introduced 8.3 mL (5.99 g, 0.0591 mol) of diisopropylamine and 120 mL of tetrahydrofuran with a syringe through the septum. The flask is cooled in a dry ice–hexane bath. To the solution is slowly added 38.7 mL of butyllithium (1.53 M in hexane, 0.0592 mol) with a syringe and the mixture is kept at 0°C (in an ice bath) for 10 min. The resulting solution of lithium diisopropylamide is again cooled in a dry ice–hexane bath (−78°C), and 11.2 mL (11.57 g, 0.0645 mol) of N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) is added. After stirring for 30 min, 6.47 mL (6.15 g, 0.0539 mol) of methyl tiglate is injected drop by drop at −78°C. After the solution is stirred for an additional 20 min, 13.0 g (0.0537 mol) of 1-iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane 1 is added with a syringe and the dry ice–hexane bath is replaced with an ice bath. The solution is stirred at about 0°C for 1 hr and then poured onto 150 mL of ice-cooled 3 N hydrochloric acid covered with 150 mL of hexane. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 80-mL portions of hexane.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is now transferred to a Claisen flask connected with a water-cooled condenser, and the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at ordinary pressure by raising the temperature of the oil bath gradually to 200–220°. The water condenser is then replaced by a short air-cooled condenser, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. A small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride first distils over, after which the receiver is changed and the temperature rises rapidly to the boiling point of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 197°/73 mm.

The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. During this time, an exotherm is observed (up to 50°C) followed by a slow return to room temperature, and the suspension becomes thicker. The reaction is brought to reflux (in ca. 20 min) by means of a heating mantle and stirring is continued for another 3.5 hr. A two-necked, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser and magnetic stirrer is charged with crushed ice (400 g) and water (100 g), and the hot mixture is added carefully with good stirring. Light petroleum ether (500 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with light petroleum ether (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3 × 50 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (2 × 30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at ambient pressure to give the crude product as a dark oil.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a dropping funnel, mercury-sealed stirrer, and condenser, is placed 625 g. (3.2 moles) of n-butyl sulfite (p. 112). The condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap, and 217 g. (131 cc., 1.6 moles) of sulfuryl chloride is added over a period of thirty minutes, with rapid stirring and cooling with tap water. The dropping funnel is then replaced by a thermometer dipping into the liquid, and the flask is heated slowly, with stirring, until the refluxing of the butyl chloride becomes vigorous (about 100–110°). Sulfur dioxide is evolved copiously during this time. The condenser is replaced with a 40-cm. Vigreux column and downward condenser; the temperature is gradually raised to 130–135° and kept there until no more sulfur dioxide or butyl chloride distils. The heating and distillation require about two hours. The residue of crude n-butyl sulfate is cooled to room temperature, and 100 cc. of saturated sodium carbonate solution is added. The mixture is stirred for about ten minutes, poured into a separatory funnel, and let stand for thirty minutes to allow the layers to separate. The upper layer is dried with calcium chloride, at least overnight, and then allowed to stand over 15 g. of anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate for a day, with occasional shaking. The product is filtered into a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and distilled from an oil bath. The first distillation gives 250–280 g. (74–83 per cent of the calculated amount) of n-butyl sulfate, b.p. 110–114°/4 mm., which has a sharp odor. Redistillation gives a pure material with a slight ester odor, boiling at 109–111° at 4 mm., with only a small mechanical loss.

DESCRIPTION: An intimate mixture of 166 g. (1.2 moles) of anhydrous potassium carbonate and 294 g. (2 moles) of phthalimide is treated with 506 g. (4 moles) of benzyl chloride, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 190° under a reflux condenser for three hours. While the mixture is still hot, the excess benzyl chloride is removed by steam distillation. Near the end of this operation the benzyl phthalimide crystallizes. It is advisable to cool the mixture rapidly with very vigorous agitation so that the material is in as fine a state of division as possible. The solid is filtered on a large Büchner funnel, thoroughly washed with water, and drained as completely as possible by suction. It is then washed once with 400 cc. of 60 per cent alcohol and drained again. The yield of this product, melting at 100–110°, is 340–375 g. (72–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: The clear filtrate, which has only a pale yellow color, is now run, with stirring, into the cuprous chloride solution in a 12-l. flask, while the temperature is kept at 25–30°. A somewhat sticky precipitate first forms, which later becomes crystalline; nitrogen is evolved in a continuous stream. The addition requires about thirty minutes. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath under an efficient reflux condenser until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. It is then distilled in a current of steam (using the apparatus described on p. 479) until no more chloronitrobenzene passed over; 9–10 l. of distillate collects during this process. When quite cold, the water is decanted off, and the solid shaken with 1–2 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50°. The mixture is again allowed to cool, and the light yellow alkaline solution is decanted from the solid product, which is then collected on a filter, washed with a little cold water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. It boils completely at 116–117°/12 mm. or 124–125°/18 mm., and the distillate solidifies to a pale yellow solid which melts at 44–45° and weighs 430–450 g. (68–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).

In a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.8-cm, egg-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a condenser, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (4.86 g, 34.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is dissolved in MeOH (150 mL) and then water (10 mL) is added. Benzylhydrazine dihydrochloride (6.75 g, 34.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is added in one portion. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 3 h, hydrazone 3 is formed. 4-Methyl-β-nitrostyrene (4.51 g, 27.7 mmol) is added in one portion and the reaction solution is stirred at room temperature open to air until complete. The condenser is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel and water (50 mL) is slowly added into the mixture over 20 min and the resulting white suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 h. The resulting white solid is collected on a 250-mL fritted glass Büchner funnel by vacuum filtration (washing with ca. 30 mL of 1:1 MeOH/H2O) and is suction-dried (ca. 10 min). The solid is transferred into a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask and further dried under vacuum at room temperature for 8 h. The title compound is obtained as a white solid (9.12 g, 25.3 mmol, 92%).

DESCRIPTION: The flask A is heated by means of an oil bath maintained at 120–125°; the mixed vapors of alcohol and water, passing through the fractionating column, are condensed in D, and the moist alcohol is delivered under the surface of the alcohol contained in flask B. In flask B are placed 250 cc. of absolute alcohol and about 200 g. of freshly ignited potassium carbonate. Flask B is heated in an oil bath maintained at about 95–100°. The moist alcohol delivered to the flask B is dried by the potassium carbonate and subsequently returned as vapor under the surface of the liquid in flask A. The tube C, which is provided with a calcium chloride tube and is open to the air, acts as a vent for the otherwise closed system. The reaction is run for about five hours. The excess alcohol is then distilled, the residue of ethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 98–101°/21 mm. is collected. The yield is 234–264 g.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is heated by means of an oil bath (inside temperature 130–135°) for 2 hours, care being taken to avoid overheating, and then allowed to cool to 90–95°. The fumaryl chloride is distilled as rapidly as possible (20 minutes), and the portion boiling over a 25° range (60–85°/13–14 mm.) is collected. It is then redistilled slowly (1 hour), and the portion boiling over a 2° range (62–64°/13 mm.) is collected. The yield is 125–143 g. (82–95%) and.

DESCRIPTION: The flask is then heated in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 190–210° and the mixture is distilled with steam. The sulfonate groups are hydrolyzed in this process, and the bromophenol passes over as a heavy, colorless or pale yellow oil. In about one hour the distillate is clear. The product is extracted with ether, the ether is removed by distillation from the steam bath, and the residue is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The fraction boiling at 194–200° represents practically pure o-bromophenol. The yield is 70–75 g. (40–43 per cent of the theoretical amount). o-Bromophenol is a colorless liquid with a very characteristic odor. It is rather unstable and decomposes on standing, becoming brown or red in color.

DESCRIPTION: When the reprecipitated m-nitroacetophenone (50–55 g.) is dry it is dissolved in 100 cc. of hot alcohol in a 300-cc. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath and shaken vigorously while crystallization is taking place. Because of the great change in solubility between 60° and 50° the agitation of the liquid must be vigorous during this temperature interval, or large clumps of crystals will be formed instead of the purer and more easily dried mush.

A 25-mL test tube is charged with 0.3–0.4 g (0.6–0.8 mmol) of bis(copper trifluoromethanesulfonate)benzene complex and sealed with a rubber septum under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. A solution of 5 mL (4.3 g, 0.031 mol) of 4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadien-3-ol in 10 mL of ether is added by means of a syringe. The resulting solution is poured into a nitrogen-flushed Pyrex 250-mL annular reactor fitted with a magnetic stirrer, an internal concentric water-jacketed quartz immersion well, and a water-cooled reflux condenser topped with a gas inlet for maintaining an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. An additional 20 mL (17.4 g, 0.124 mol) of the hydroxydiene 2 in 200 mL of dry ether is added. The resulting solution is stirred and irradiated for 15 hr with a 450-W medium-pressure Hanovia mercury are that is suspended in the immersion well. At the end of that time an opaque film of copper is wiped from the immersion well, and irradiation is then continued for an additional 7 hr. The resulting solution is shaken in a separatory funnel with a mixture of 100 g of ice and 100 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The organic phases are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.

(1.00 mole) of 2-phenylbutyronitrile, 2.3 g. (0.010 mole) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and 50 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide. The gas-inlet tube is adjusted to extend below the surface of the liquid, and a gas-exit tube is attached to the flask. A slow stream of acetylene is passed through the gas-inlet tube into the flask, removing the air. After 5 minutes, 56 g. of finely powdered potassium hydroxide is added and stirring is begun. Acetylene is introduced at the rate of 15–20 l./hour. An exothermic reaction occurs; the temperature rises to 70–80° and is held in this range with a cold water bath. After 40–60 minutes, a warm bath is required to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture at 60–70°, and stirring is continued for an additional 20–30 minutes. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, the inlet tube is replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 500 ml. of water is added slowly. The resulting dark-brown mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed twice with 200-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene layers are combined and washed successively with 200 ml. of water, 100 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and 200 ml. of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation at reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled through a short Vigreux column, giving 125–135 g. of crude product, b.p. 115–125° (13 mm.). Redistillation of this product through a Vigreux column gives 101–107 g.

DESCRIPTION: C. (5S,6R)-4-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenylmorpholin-2-one. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 33.2 g (0.083 mol) of crude ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl) glycinate, 1.90 g (0.010 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 670 mL of benzene. The reaction flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extractor, which is packed with 65 g of calcium chloride (CaCl2, anhydrous, 30 mesh) and a condenser with a drying tube. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 10 hr. After the first 4 hr, the CaCl2 in the Soxhlet extractor is replaced; the total amount of CaCl2 used in the reaction is 130 g. Ultimately, the reaction mixture becomes a suspension. Removal of benzene under reduced pressure yields white solids that are dissolved in 310 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The solution is washed with water and 5% aqueous NaHCO3 in a separatory funnel until the CH2Cl2 solution becomes clear. After removal of CH2Cl2 under vacuum, the resulting white crystals are dissolved by boiling in 600 mL of absolute EtOH; the resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The white crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold EtOH, and dried at 60°C. Concentration of the mother liquor by rotary evaporation affords a residue that can also be recrystallized in absolute EtOH to provide additional product. The above described procedure is performed in duplicate, providing (5S,6R)-4-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenylmorpholin-2-one in yields of 21.7 g and 20.3 g (average yield for the two steps: 71%).

DESCRIPTION: The 1-L flask containing the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 is equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar. The solids are scraped off the walls using a spatula. The flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and charged with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g) and dichloromethane (140 mL). The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and treated sequentially with triethylamine (60.0 mL, 43.6 g, 0.425 mol, 1.5 equiv) and pivaldehyde (95% purity, 35 mL, 28 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.07 equiv corrected for purity). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature. Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 °C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 °C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 °C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.

To the stirred mixture, 24 g (0.234 mol) of triethylamine is added dropwise via the addition funnel. After stirring vigorously for 20 hr at room temperature, the solids are removed by filtration and washed three times with THF. The clear yellowish filtrate and washes are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (to remove solvent, excess triethylamine, and ethyl bromoacetate) to afford an off-white solid, which is collected with a Buchner funnel, then washed with water to dissolve residual salts. The residue is air-dried in the filter funnel with water aspirator vacuum. The crude product is dissolved in 117 mL of boiling absolute ethanol (EtOH) and stored at room temperature overnight. White crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold (0°C) absolute EtOH carefully, and dried at 50°C.

DESCRIPTION: The white, finely divided precipitate of nitrourea is filtered upon a 12-cm. Büchner funnel. A hardened filter paper is used in this operation, and the nitrourea is pressed as dry as possible. The product is washed in the funnel with four portions of cold water just sufficient to cover it, and pressed dry each time. Then it is dried in the air. By strongly cooling the filtrates, a further small amount of nitrourea may be obtained and added to the main portion. The yield of air-dried material is 120–150 g. (70–87 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts with decomposition at 150–164° and is sufficiently pure for use in the preparation of semicarbazide and.

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 50 g. (0.257 mole) of dry hydroquinone diacetate (p. 452) and 116 g. (0.87 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is finely powdered in a mortar and introduced into a dry 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an air condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a gas-absorption trap. The flask is placed in an oil bath which is heated slowly from room temperature so that at the end of about 30 minutes the temperature of the oil reaches 110–120°, at which point the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins. The temperature is then raised slowly to 160–165° and maintained at that point for about 3 hours; at the end of about 2 hours the evolution of hydrogen chloride becomes very slow and the mass assumes a green color and becomes pasty in consistency.

DESCRIPTION: B. Sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate. 2-Nitrobenzenesulfinic acid (3.74 g., 0.020 mole) is suspended in 10 ml. of water, and sufficient 1N NaOH (about 20 ml.) is added to the well-stirred mixture to dissolve the acid and bring the pH to 9. Palladium oxide (0.2–1.0 g.,) is suspended in 20 ml. of water in a 200-ml. glass hydrogenation bottle. The bottle is attached to a hydrogenation apparatus such as that of Adams and Voorhees,2 and the suspension is shaken with hydrogen under a pressure of 1–3 atm. until the palladium oxide is reduced. The solution of 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is added, and the mixture is shaken under a hydrogen pressure of 1–3 atm. The solution becomes completely decolorized in 2–6 hours, during which time about 95% of the calculated amount of hydrogen is absorbed. The catalyst is separated by filtration and washed with two 20-ml. portions of water, which are added to the filtrate. The filtrate, which may have a yellowish color, is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (bath temperature 45°). The residue, a white or light yellow solid, is sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate. After being dried in a desiccator over calcium chloride, it weighs 3.05–3.20 g. (85–89%).

DESCRIPTION: This residue is stirred at room temperature while 150 ml. of triethylamine is added. Triethylamine hydrobromide begins to precipitate soon after the addition is started, and the resulting slurry is refluxed gently for 15 minutes. It is then cooled to room temperature, and the insoluble material is removed by filtration and washed with benzene. Concentration of the combined filtrates under reduced pressure leaves an oily residue, which is dissolved in 600 ml. of diethyl ether. The ethereal solution is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, washed with two 20-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting oil is distilled at reduced pressure. A forerun of 265 mg. is collected below 103° (22 mm.) before 6.7 g.

DESCRIPTION: When the reaction mixture has been at room temperature for 90 minutes, 300 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added slowly, followed by 500 ml. of chloroform. The resulting aqueous layer is separated and washed with three 100-ml. portions of chloroform, and the combined chloroform solutions are dried with sodium sulfate and decolorized with activated carbon. Removal of chloroform with a rotary evaporator leaves an oily residue, which is readily crystallized from 100 ml. of methanol. The colorless crystals are collected by filtration and washed with petroleum ether, giving 33.5–35.3 g. (72–77%) of 2-methylthio-2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane, m.p. 76–78°.

DESCRIPTION: A 500 ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Trubore stirrer, a pressure-compensating dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser with drying tube. The flask is charged with 144 g. of triphenylphosphine (0.55 mole) and 125 ml. of acetonitrile and. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath and 88 g. of bromine is added dropwise over a period of 20–30 minutes. After the addition of the bromine is complete, the ice bath is removed and 72 g. (0.50 mole) of β-naphthol in 100 ml. of acetonitrile is added in one portion and the reaction mixture is heated to 60–70° for at least 30 minutes. The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, stirring is discontinued, and the acetonitrile is distilled under aspirator pressure until the oil bath temperature reaches 110°. After all the acetonitrile has been removed, the condenser is replaced by a short, large glass tube connected to a 500-ml. flask half-filled with water, and the oil bath is replaced by a Wood's metal bath. The bath temperature is now raised to 200–220° and kept at this temperature until all the solid has melted. The mixture is stirred and the bath temperature is raised to 340° and held at this temperature until evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases (approximately 20–30 minutes). The Wood's metal bath is removed and the reaction mixture is cooled to approximately 100° and then poured into a 1-l. beaker and cooled to room temperature. Pentane (300 ml.) is added and the solid is broken into a fine precipitate. The solid is filtered by suction and washed thoroughly with two 300-ml. portions of pentane. The pentane filtrates are combined, washed with 200 ml. of 20% sodium hydroxide, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The pentane extract is then passed through a 25 mm. diameter column filled to 35 cm. in depth with alumina; distillation of the pentane at reduced pressure gives 72–81 g. (70–78%) of 2-bromonaphthalene, a white solid melting at 45–50° (reported:2 55–56.4°),.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride tube is charged with 250 ml. of dry diethyl ether. With an acetone–dry ice bath the temperature of the ether is lowered to −10 to −15° and maintained within this range while a slow stream of hydrogen chloride is introduced, with slow stirring, for about 45 minutes. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a glass stopper, and 10.0 g. (0.0259 mole) of cholestan-3-one is added while the temperature of the stirred solution is kept below −15°. The reaction mixture is cooled to −20°, and 12.3 g. (0.188 g.-atom) of activated zinc is added over a 2–3 minute period. The temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to rise to −5°, and it is maintained between −4° and 0° for 2 hours. Stirring is not interrupted for the duration of the reaction. The mixture is finally cooled to −15° and poured slowly onto about 130 g. of crushed ice. The ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of ether that had been used to rinse the reaction vessel. The ethereal solutions are combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The ether is distilled under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath, leaving 9.3–9.5 g. of a colorless, liquid residue that solidifies on cooling. This solid is dissolved in 30–40 ml. of n-hexane. The solution is poured onto a 3.5 cm. by 17 cm. column of silica gel and eluted with 80–90 ml. of n-hexane. Distillation of the solvent under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath leaves 8.0–8.2 g. (82–84%) of cholestane, which, after recrystallization from ethanol-ether, yields 7.3–7.5 g. (76–77%) of product as plates m.p. 78–79° (lit., m.p. 80°)3.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction is carried out in a catalytic hydrogenation apparatus similar to the one described by Adams and Voorhees.1 In a 1-l. reduction bottle are placed 0.5 g. of platinum oxide catalyst1 and 50 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol. The bottle is connected to a calibrated low-pressure hydrogen tank and alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is then admitted to the system until the pressure is 1–2 atm. (15–30 lb.), and the bottle is shaken for 20–30 minutes to reduce the platinum oxide. The shaker is stopped, air is admitted to the bottle, and a solution of 61.0 g. (1.0 mole) of ethanolamine, 75.4 g. (94 ml., 1.3 moles) of acetone, and 100 ml. of absolute ethanol is rinsed into the reduction bottle with 50 ml. of absolute ethanol. The bottle is alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is admitted to the system until the pressure is approximately 25 lb., and the bottle is shaken until the pressure drop indicates that the theoretical amount (1 mole) of hydrogen has been taken up and absorption ceases (6–10 hours). Air is admitted to the bottle, and the catalyst is removed by filtration through a Hirsch funnel with a filter plate of small diameter. The bottle is rinsed with a total of 75ml. of benzene, which is also poured through the funnel. The filtrate is rinsed into a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask with 25 ml. of benzene, and most of the solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure. Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure yields 97–98 g. of 2-isopropylaminoethanol, b.p. 86–87°/23 mm. (94–95%, based on the ethanolamine used).

DESCRIPTION: The bomb is cooled, the remaining hydrogen is discharged, and the bomb is opened. The solution is transferred to a beaker, and the bomb is rinsed with a little methanol which is added to the solution. The catalyst is removed by filtration (Caution! The catalyst may be pyrophoric), and most of the filtrate is transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask set on a steam bath for distillation of the methanol; the remainder of the filtrate is introduced into the Claisen flask when the volume of the first portion has been reduced sufficiently by distillation. After all the methanol has been removed the aminoacetal is distilled under diminished pressure. The yield of m-aminobenzaldehyde dimethylacetal, a light-yellow liquid boiling at 123–124°/4 mm. or 110–112°/1.5 mm., is 168–196 g. (67–78%).

DESCRIPTION: A. o-Nitrobenzaldiacetate. In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an effective mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, and surrounded by an ice bath, are placed 600 g. (570 ml.) of glacial acetic acid, 565 ml. (612 g., 6 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 50 g. (0.36 mole) of o-nitrotoluene. To this solution is added slowly, with stirring, 156 g. (85 ml., 1.5 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid. When the mixture has cooled to 5°, 100 g. (1 mole) of chromium trioxide is added in small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10°; about 2 hours is required for the addition. Stirring is continued for 5 hours after the chromium trioxide has been added. The reaction mixture is poured into a large jar two-thirds filled with chipped ice, and cold water is added until the total volume is about 6 l. The mixture is then stirred vigorously for at least 15 minutes to promote solidification of the oily layer. The oily solid is filtered with suction on a Büchner funnel, washed with cold water, and then stirred mechanically with 500 ml. of cold 2% sodium carbonate solution. The solid is then collected on a filter, washed with cold water, and dried in the air. The crude substance is digested with 150 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) for 30 minutes, cooled, and filtered. After having been dried in a vacuum desiccator, the product weighs 21–22 g.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Dinitrodurene.—A solution of 13.4 g. (0.1 mole) and of durene (p. 248) in 100 cc. of chloroform is added to 75 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in an 800-cc. beaker provided with a thermometer and an efficient mechanical stirrer. The mixture is cooled to 10°, and 16 g. (10.7 cc.) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.5) is added drop by drop, with stirring, from a 125-cc. separatory funnel, the mixture being cooled in an ice-salt bath and the nitric acid added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 50° (about fifteen minutes is required for the addition). As soon as all the acid has been added the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, the sulfuric acid layer is removed, and the upper chloroform layer is immediately run into 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution. The sulfuric acid layer is discarded because it contains very little dinitrodurene. Four portions are nitrated, and the combined chloroform solutions are washed twice with 2.5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, dried overnight with 30 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and the chloroform distilled until crystals of dinitrodurene begin to appear. At this point four times the volume of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added (about 500 cc.), and the resulting mixture is cooled to 10°. The solid is filtered and washed twice with 50 cc. of cold (10°) 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The yield from four nitrations is 82.5–84 g.

DESCRIPTION: The flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam.

DESCRIPTION: A. (S)-Phenylalanol. A dry, 3-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser connected to a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is loaded with 165 g (1.00 mol) of (S)-phenylalanine, then equipped with a 250-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel capped with a rubber septum through which is inserted a nitrogen inlet needle. The flask is swept with nitrogen and filled with 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the addition funnel is charged with 123 mL (1.00 mol) of freshly distilled boron trifluoride etherate via cannula. The boron trifluoride etherate is added dropwise to the phenylalanine slurry over a 30-min period with stirring, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr, resulting in a colorless, homogeneous solution. The addition funnel is then charged via cannula with 88 g (110 mL, 1.15 mol) of 20 M borane–dimethyl sulfide complex, which is added carefully to the vigorously refluxing solution over a 100-min period. During the course of the addition there is continuous evolution of dimethyl sulfide and hydrogen gas, and the solution turns from orange to light brown. A vigorous exotherm occurs approximately half way through the addition period. (Caution! See) The solution is heated at reflux for an additional 6 hr after the addition is complete and, then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The excess borane is quenched by the slow addition of 125 mL of a 1:1 tetrahydrofuran–water solution followed by 750 mL of 5 M aqueous sodium hydroxide. The resulting two-phase mixture is heated at reflux for 12 hr, cooled to room temperature, and filtered through a coarse fritted funnel. The residual solids are washed with two 25-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove the bulk of the tetrahydrofuran. The resulting slurry is extracted with one 400-mL and three 200-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation, yielding 141–158 g (93–104%) of a white crystalline solid that is recrystallized from ca. 600 mL of ethyl acetate to give 111–113 g (73–75%) of the desired product as white needles in two crops, mp 88.5–91°C.

DESCRIPTION: D. Reduction of (S)-(−)-BINAPO to (S)-(−)-BINAP. In a 300-mL, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser which is connected through a three-way stopcock to an argon inlet tube and a bubbler, is placed 4.5 g (6.9 mmol) of (S)-BINAPO. The flask is flushed with argon followed by the addition of 100 mL of dry, degassed xylene, 4.2 mL of triethylamine (3.1 g, 30 mmol), and 3.0 mL (4.0 g, 29 mmol) of trichlorosilane by means of syringes. The mixture is stirred and heated at 100°C for 1 hr, at 120°C for 1 hr, and finally at refluxing temperature for 6 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, 70 mL of 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is carefully added. The mixture is then stirred at 60°C until the organic and aqueous layers become clear, and it is transferred into a 300-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of warm toluene. The combined organic layer is washed with 70 mL of 30% sodium hydroxide solution and three 100-mL portions of water, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 15 mL, and to this added 15 mL of degassed methanol. The precipitates are collected on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with 15 mL of methanol, and dried at 80°C (0.05 mm) for 6 hr to give 4.2 g (97% yield) of (S)-BINAP as colorless solid, mp 236–238°C, [α]D25 −223° (benzene, c 0.502) and.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5-cm., glass-coated, magnetic stirring bar, a Dewar condenser connected to a static argon line, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, is sealed with a rubber septum. After flushing with argon, 30 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and 19.5 ml. of 1.89 M (0.0368 mole) methyllithium solution are injected through the septum into the flask. A solution of 4.54 g. (0.0249 mole) of benzophenone in 35 ml. of anhydrous ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period. The mixture is allowed to stir for one half hour. The septum is removed, and the side arm is quickly adapted with Tygon® tubing leading through a tower of solid potassium hydroxide to a tank of anhydrous ammonia. After approximately 75 ml. of ammonia is slowly distilled into the flask, the tubing is removed, and 0.525 g. (0.0761 g.-atom, ca. 15 cm. added as 0.5 cm. pieces) of lithium wire is quickly added, and the flask is stoppered. After 15 minutes the dark blue color is discharged by the continuous addition of excess ammonium chloride (ca. 5 g. over a 15-minute period). The argon-inlet tube is disconnected, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is then partitioned between 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator yields 4.36–4.49 g. of crude product. Filtration of the product through 60 g. of Woelm alumina (Grade III) with 150 ml. of petroleum ether affords 4.16–4.31 g. (92–95%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, which on evaporative distillation in a Kügelrohr oven gives 4.12–4.21 g. (91–93%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, b.p. 100° (0.25 mm.), nD28 1.5691.

DESCRIPTION: An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 1000 mL of freshly distilled methylene chloride. One of the outer two necks of the flask is equipped with a gas inlet adapter attached to a nitrogen source and the other with a septum connected through a needle to a bubbler. A 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped with a septum is placed in the center neck of the flask with the stopcock closed. The funnel is charged with 12.1 mL (150 mmol) of methylene iodide dissolved in 75 mL of distilled methylene chloride . The solution is stirred under nitrogen for 1 hr and the flask is cooled in an ice-water bath. Using a syringe, 15.4 mL (150 mmol) of neat diethylzinc is added to the methylene chloride through the septum. The stopcock of the addition funnel is opened carefully and the methylene iodide solution is allowed to drip into the diethylzinc solution over the course of 30 min. After the reaction is stirred for an additional 10 min, 8.0 mL (50 mmol) of methyl 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanoate is added to the flask over a period of 15 sec through the septum using a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 45 min, the septum is removed, and the reaction is quenched through the careful addition of 125 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. Stirring is maintained for an additional 10 min, at which time the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The lower organic layer is withdrawn and placed in a large, round-bottomed flask. The methylene chloride is removed using a rotary evaporator and the residue is diluted with 500 mL of diethyl ether and placed in the separatory funnel. It is washed successively with 125-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate , 1 M aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, deionized water and brine. The aqueous washings are extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 150 mL) and the combined organic layers are dried over 50 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate prior to concentration under reduced pressure. The product is purified by vacuum distillation from anhydrous potassium carbonate (58°C, 1 mm) to give methyl 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-hexanoate (7.63-8.09 g, 89-94% yield) as a clear liquid.

DESCRIPTION: C. Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3). Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 2 (34.1 g crude product) is dissolved in THF (150 mL). Under an atmosphere of argon in a second flame-dried, 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium tert-butoxide (41.6 g, 371 mmol, 4 equiv, assuming 100% purity of 2) is dissolved in THF (100 mL). The resulting cloudy solution is then cooled with an ice bath. At 0 °C the solution of 2 is transferred through a teflon tube (1.5 mm internal diameter) over a period of 15 min into the 500-mL flask. During the period of addition the color changes from orange to brown and finally to black. Then the ice bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 2 h until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the dibromide 2. Distilled water (15 mL) is added and the black mixture is poured onto a pad of silica gel (diameter 10 cm x 4 cm height) that has already been wetted with diethyl ether. The pad is rinsed with 700 mL of diethyl ether, and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction, dried over Na2SO4 (40 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675 to 75 mmHg) and then at 15 mmHg for 1 h. The crude product remains as a brown solid (18.5 g), which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask and dried overnight under vacuum (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Purification by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-145 °C, 0.2 mmHg) affords 13.0 g (69%, two steps from 1) of dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3) as colorless plates.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then, for removal of residual lithium, filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5.0 cm diameter, porosity 0). The funnel is subsequently rinsed with THF (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at a bath temperature of 40 °C (255-225 mmHg) and then at 50 °C (7.5 mmHg) for 1 h in order to remove THF. Dichloromethane (700 mL) is added to the residue. After stirring for 2 min, insoluble material is removed by filtration with a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 4) filled with silica gel (100 g). The residue is washed with dichloromethane (700 mL) and the filtrate dried over Na2SO4 (50 g). The latter is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675-525 mmHg and then 15 mmHg) for 1 h. The crude product remains as a pale yellow semifluidic mass (40.5 g), which solidifies under vacuum overnight (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Finally, the product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-175 °C, 0.25 mmHg) to yield pure 1 (19.6 g, 49%) as colorless plates.

DESCRIPTION: C. 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole ((S)-tert-ButylPHOX). A 150-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a glass valve, a glass stopper, and a 1.7 cm × 0.7 cm, egg-shaped, teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is dried with a heat gun under vacuum and cooled under argon atmosphere. The glass stopper is removed under a positive pressure of argon and the flask is charged with copper(I) iodide (19.0 mg, 0.10 mmol, 0.005 equiv), diphenylphosphine (4.35 mL, 25.0 mmol, 1.25 equiv), N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (53 μL, 0.50 mmol, 0.025 equiv) and toluene (20 mL). The flask is sealed with the glass stopper and the colorless contents are stirred at ambient temperature for 20 min. The glass stopper is then removed under a positive pressure of argon and the flask is charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole (5.64 g, 20.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv), cesium carbonate (9.78 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv), and toluene (20 mL, 0.50 M total) to wash the neck and walls of the flask. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold. The now yellow heterogeneous reaction is placed in a 110 °C oil bath and vigorously stirred under argon atmosphere. Following consumption of starting material, the reaction is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, filtered through a pad of celite, and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (2 × 40 mL). The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 °C, 15 mmHg) to a pale yellow semi-solid. The residue is dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane (ca. 40 mL), dry-loaded onto silica gel (10 g), and purified by silica gel chromatography eluting with 24:1 hexanes/diethyl ether until excess Ph2PH elutes, then with a 9:1 dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture until the desired product elutes. The combined fractions are concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 °C, 14 mmHg) to a viscous, pale yellow oil and layered with acetonitrile (ca. 5 mL) to facilitate crystallization. The flask is swirled while crystals form within seconds. After approximately 15 minutes, the flask is placed under high vacuum to remove volatiles to afford 6.81 g (17.6 mmol, 88% yield) of (S)-tert-ButylPHOX as white blocks.

DESCRIPTION: A flame-dried, three-necked, 1-L flask equipped with a glass stopper, a water-cooled reflux condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stir bar is charged with 13.2 g of 60% sodium hydride (331 mmol, 1.10 equiv) and tetrahydrofuran (250 mL). The flask is immersed in a water bath (22 °C) and a solution of 72.2 g of crude diallyl pimelate (301 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added in a steady stream via cannula during the course of 5 min. Some moderate bubbling (hydrogen evolution) of the reaction mixture is observed during the addition. Following the addition, the suspension is heated to 40 °C and then stirred for 10 h whereupon the reaction mixture turned to a clear, yellowish solution. Once the starting material is consumed (based on TLC, Note 5), 24.3 mL of neat iodomethane (391 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added to the mixture, which became a white suspension. After an additional 15 h at 40 °C, the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature (22 °C) and water (60 mL) is added carefully via syringe over the course of 9 min to obtain a clear, yellowish solution. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, the THF is removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 150 mmHg), and the remaining solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 75 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (1 × 50 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (5 g). After filtration through cotton, the organic solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 75 mmHg) to yield a yellow liquid. The material is purified by short-path distillation until the first drop of the distillate turned yellow to give 52.9–53.0 g (270 mmol, 90% yield) of a clear, colorless liquid boiling from 69-72 °C/0.08 mmHg. GC analysis found >99% product purity.

DESCRIPTION: B. cis-1-Acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene. A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and a rubber septum is charged with 17.5 g (0.1 mol) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene, 0.49 g (2.2 mol) of palladium acetate and 2.4 g (9.0 mmol) of triphenylphosphine. The flask is flushed with nitrogen. To the flask is added 550 mL of a 0.2 M solution (0.11 mol) of sodium dimethyl malonate in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by syringe. The flask is again flushed with nitrogen and the reaction mixture, which now has turned yellow, is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The flask is opened and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added. The stirring is continued for 20 min, and then 100 mL of water and 200 mL of ether are added. The contents of the flask are transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated. The remaining aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 300 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with 200 mL of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 400 mL, and then filtered through a short silica gel column. Removal of the rest of the solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure gives 30.4–31.3 g of a light-brown oil. Excess dimethyl malonate is removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 100°C (1 mm). Kugelrohr distillation (140°C, 0.2 mm) of the remaining crude product affords 25.9–26.7 g (91%) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene as a light-brown oil.

DESCRIPTION: B. 1-Cyclohexenylacetonitrile. The benzene solution is allowed to cool to about 50°, and the flask is attached to a Vigreux column. The benzene is removed under reduced pressure, whereupon the residual cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid solidifies. The flask is then heated slowly in an oil bath to 165–175° while the system is evacuated with a water pump to a pressure of 35–45 mm. (not lower). The acid melts, decarboxylation occurs very rapidly, and the crude 1-cyclohexenylacetonitrile distils at 100–120°/35–45 mm.

DESCRIPTION: To 2750 g. (2 l., 13.6 moles) of 40 per cent hydrobromic acid in a 3-l. flask is added 317 g. (4.5 moles) of ethylene cyanohydrin (p. 256), and the mixture is boiled for two hours under a reflux condenser. The condenser is then arranged for downward distillation and a thermometer immersed in the reaction mixture; dilute hydrobromic acid is distilled off until the temperature in the flask reaches 121°, whereupon the receiver is changed and a fraction consisting of stronger hydrobromic acid is collected over the range 121–129°. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 129°, very little hydrobromic acid remains, and on cooling, the mass sets to an almost colorless solid. This is now dissolved in 2000 cc. of carbon tetrachloride, and the ammonium bromide is filtered off and washed with 500 cc. more of the solvent; a thin aqueous layer is separated and 1500 cc. of the carbon tetrachloride distilled from the filtrate. On cooling, about 470 g. of β-bromopropionic acid crystallizes from the residue; on filtering and drying, this melts at 62.5–63.5°. With further concentration, the mother liquor yields a second crop of β-bromopropionic acid, amounting to 60–70 g.

DESCRIPTION: The well-stirred solution of Caro's acid is poured into the suspension of nitroaminotoluene. The mixture is stirred and warmed, but as soon as the temperature reaches 40°, heating is discontinued. After the solution has been stirred for 2 hours longer, an additional 100 g. (0.37 mole) of powdered potassium persulfate is added in one portion. The heat of reaction is sufficient to maintain the temperature at 40°. Stirring is continued for 2 hours more, and the suspension is then diluted with water to 4 l. The solid is filtered with suction and washed with 400 ml. of water. The wet material is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, about 700 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is steam-distilled. The 2-nitroso-5-nitrotoluene is filtered from the distillate.

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. beaker are placed 108 g. (1 mole) of o-phenylenediamine, 120 g. (115 ml., 2 moles) of glacial acetic acid, and 300 ml. of water. By warming the mixture slightly a clear solution is obtained. The beaker is placed in ice water, and the contents are cooled to 5°. As soon as this temperature is reached, a cold solution of 75 g. (1.09 moles) of sodium nitrite in 120 ml. of water is added all at once, the mixture being stirred with a glass rod or by a slow mechanical stirrer. The reaction mixture turns dark green, and the temperature rises rapidly to 70–80°. The color of the solution changes to a clear orange-red. The beaker is now removed from the cooling bath, and the contents are allowed to stand for 1 hour; as the solution cools, the benzotriazole separates as an oil. The beaker is then packed in ice, and the mixture is stirred until it sets to a solid mass. After being kept cold for 3 hours, the solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 200 ml. of ice water, and sucked as dry as possible under a rubber dam. The tan-colored product, after drying at 45–50° overnight, weighs 110–116 g.

DESCRIPTION: B. 3-Chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran. A dry, 4-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a gas-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask is charged with 51 g. (2.11 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. Methyl bromide (200 g., 2.15 moles) is allowed to distill into the continuously stirred reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. The formation of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide requires approximately 2 hours. The gas-inlet tube is then replaced with a dry, 1-l. dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice–salt bath. The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0°), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, then concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 122–136 g. (65–72%) of a mixture of cis- and trans-3-chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid, boiling over the range 48–95° (17–18 mm.), sufficiently pure for use in the next step.

DESCRIPTION: B. Diethyl tert-butylmalonate. A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen inlet tube is dried in an oven at 110–120°, then flushed with nitrogen and allowed to cool; an atmosphere of nitrogen is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the subsequently described reactions. After 18.3 g. (0.753 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings have been placed in the flask, a solution of 113.5 g. (0.7993 mole) of methyl iodide in 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added dropwise with stirring. The resulting solution of methylmagnesium iodide is cooled to 0–5° with an external ice–salt bath, and 1.0 g. (0.010 mole) of copper(I) chloride is introduced with stirring. The temperature of the resulting mixture is kept at −5° to 0° while a solution of 100 g. (0.500 mole) of diethyl isopropylidenemalonate in 100 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, dropwise and with stirring over a period of 80–90 minutes. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed; the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and poured onto a mixture of 500–1000 g. of ice and 400 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled through a short Vigreux column, yielding 93.5–102 g. (87–94%) of diethyl tert-butylmalonate as a colorless liquid, b.p. 60–61° (0.7 mm.), n20D 1.4250.

DESCRIPTION: (B) Acridone.—In a 500-cc. flask a solution of 42.7 g. (0.2 mole) of N-phenylanthranilic acid in 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is heated on a boiling water bath for four hours and then poured into 1 l. of boiling water. Spattering is minimized by allowing the solution to run down the wall of the container. The yellow precipitate is filtered after boiling for five minutes, and the filtrate is saved. The moist solid is boiled for five minutes with a solution of 30 g. (0.28 mole) of sodium carbonate in 400 cc. of water, collected with suction, and washed well with water. After drying in the air the crude acridone weighs 35.5–37.5 g. (91–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 344–346°.

The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL). Drying with anhydrous sodium sulfate (40 g), filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 40 mmHg) afford the crude product as a light yellow oil. The oil is purified by silica gel column chromatography. Fractions containing the product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 40 mmHg) and are dried to yield 11.0 g (89%) of (4S)-isopropyl-3-propionyl-2-oxazolidinone (2) as a colorless oil.

DESCRIPTION: The mixture is then cooled by means of an ice-sodium chloride bath. When the internal temperatures has reached −7°, a solution of 71.8 g. (0.33 mole) of chlorodiphenylphosphine in 100 ml. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed +10°. The addition requires about 1.25 hours. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring continued for 1.5 hours. The flask is then again immersed in an icesodium chloride bath, and 150 ml. of a cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added slowly. The ether is decanted and the remainder acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with 125 ml. of benzene each. From the combined ether and benzene solutions, the solvents are evaporated and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. After the low-boiling material, some p-dibromobenzene distills and crystallizes in the distillation bridge. At 2 × 10−2 mm., heating is continued until the phosphine reaches the stillhead. At this stage the distillation is interrupted, the stillhead and condenser containing p-dibromobenzene replaced by a clean, short distillation bridge without condenser, and the phosphine distilled at 2 × 10−2 to 10−3 mm., no forerun being taken. The main bulk distills at 180–185° (2 × 10−2 mm.). The colorless, oily distillate begins to crystallize in the receiving flask during or shortly after the distillation and weighs 81–83 g. (73–77% yield), m.p. 64–71°. This material is sufficiently pure for further reactions, e.g., Grignard reaction. A sample may be recrystallized from methanol to give colorless needles, m.p. 79–80°.

A dry, 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 14.0 g (67.2 mmol) of 1-menthoxy-1-butyne, 0.7 g of 10% palladium on barium sulfate and 180 mL of pyridine. The flask is capped with a rubber septum and by means of syringe needles is degassed and connected to a hydrogen-filled balloon. The mixture is stirred for 6 hr, whereupon the hydrogen is replaced with argon, and the reaction mixture is filtered through a glass frit under water aspirator pressure. The filtrate is diluted with 300 mL of pentane and washed first with saturated copper sulfate solution (5 × 120 mL) and then with water (1 × 200 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to give 15.8 g of a yellow oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation (0.02 mm, oven temperature 70–90°C) provides 12.7 g (90%) of (Z)-1-menthoxy-1-butene as a colorless oil.

DESCRIPTION: The solvent and excess dimethyl carbonate are removed by rotary evaporation, and the remaining yellow liquid (13.2 g of 2) is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (10%, 60 mL) is added to the flask, and the mixture is heated with magnetic stirring in an oil bath at reflux temperature for 4.5 hr. The course of the reaction is monitored by gas-chromatographic analysis. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is extracted with diethyl ether to remove nonacidic material (primarily traces of amide). An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (15%, 50 mL) is added portionwise. The suspension that forms is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (60 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the yellow liquid residue is distilled from a 25-mL flask, under reduced pressure, in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 2-cm Vigreux column and a fused-on Liebig condenser. Distillation affords 2-phenylpropionic acid (3) (14.3 g, 93%) as a pale-yellow liquid, bp 93-94°C/0.9 mm (lit.2 bp 147°C/11 mm), with > 98% purity by gas chromatography.

DESCRIPTION: One kilogram (805 cc., 9.8 moles) of 90 per cent glycerol (sp. gr., 1.243) and 20 g. of acetic acid are placed in a weighed 2-l. flask which is immersed in an oil bath heated to 100–110°. The flask is fitted with a two-holed stopper, which carries a long tube reaching to the bottom of the flask and a short exit tube. The long tube is connected to a hydrogen chloride generator; the short one, to a catch-bottle and some system for absorbing any excess of hydrogen chloride (see Fig. 7 on p. 97). A stream of dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. The absorption of gas is very rapid at the start but gradually falls off towards the end of the reaction; the stream of hydrogen chloride should be regulated accordingly. The flask is removed from time to time and weighed; when the absorption of gas practically ceases, the increase in weight will be about 875 g. (25 per cent more than the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a separatory funnel, are placed 615 g. (3.3 moles) of ethylene dibromide, 1250 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, and 450 cc. of water. The stirrer is started and the mixture heated to boiling. To the well-stirred boiling mixture a solution of 125 g. (1 mole) of anhydrous sodium sulfite in 450 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel over a period of about two hours. The solution is boiled under a reflux condenser for two hours after all the sulfite solution has been added. The condenser is then set for distillation, and the alcohol and the ethylene bromide are distilled. The remaining water solution is poured into a large evaporating dish and evaporated to dryness on the water bath. The sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate is extracted from the sodium bromide and unchanged sodium sulfite with 2 l. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol. On cooling the solution, most of the salt crystallizes; the mother liquor is used for a second extraction of the residue. The yield is 165–190 g. (78–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product may be further purified by recrystallizing from alcohol and drying in an oven at 110°. The recovery on recrystallization is 75–80 per cent.

DESCRIPTION: C. 2-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-1-[2-(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)- ethyl]-1 H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6). A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv), DMF (30 mL) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 °C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 °C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4. The stirred mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid. The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper using a ceramic Büchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid and). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator. The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid.

DESCRIPTION: B. Ethyl 3-amino-4-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)benzoate (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm). The flask is charged with nitro compound 3 (7.00 g, 18.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and methanol (285 mL). The flask is then fitted with a 3-way gas inlet adapter with an argon-filled balloon attached to one of the arms. While stirring the resultant yellow suspension, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times. While stirring under a blanket atmosphere of argon, the adapter on the flask is briefly removed and Pearlman's catalyst (500 mg,) is added as a suspension in methanol (10 mL + 5 mL rinse). The argon balloon is then replaced with another balloon filled with hydrogen gas and, while stirring the mixture, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with hydrogen gas three times. The dark yellow-black suspension is allowed to stir under the hydrogen atmosphere for a period of 24 h, after which TLC analysis indicate the disappearance of compound 3. The hydrogen balloon is once again replaced with an argon-filled balloon and the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times. The 3-way stopper is then removed, Celite 545(r) (10g) is added and the suspension stirred under the argon blanket for 10 min. The solid is removed by suction filtration over filter paper using a ceramic Büchner funnel and the solids are washed with two portions of methanol (20 - 30 mL each). The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 °C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.

DESCRIPTION: The mixture is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, and is then poured into a 5-l. flask containing 650 g. of ice and 25 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. One liter of benzene is then added, and the mixture heated on a steam bath under a return condenser. After gently boiling for five or ten minutes, the mixture is allowed to cool to 40–50°, when the benzene layer is separated, washed with 700 cc. of warm water containing 25 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and distilled. After the benzene has been removed under atmospheric pressure, the residue is transferred to a 300-cc. flask and distilled under reduced pressure, and a fraction boiling over the range 190–215°/10 mm. collected. This weighs 135–160 g.; it solidifies on cooling. It is recrystallized from 550–650 cc. of ethyl alcohol, and a colorless product, crystallizing in needles which melt sharply at 92°, is obtained. This is filtered off and washed twice with 30-cc. portions of fresh alcohol. The alcoholic mother liquor is concentrated and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, material which distils over at 190–200°/10 mm. being collected. This is recrystallized from ethyl alcohol, and 6–7 g. more of pure material is thus obtained. The total yield of recrystallized product is 125–154 g. (68–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are mixed 152 g. (2 moles) of finely divided thiourea and 70 cc. of water. To this is added 138 g. (1.1 moles) of technical methyl sulfate. The flask is immediately attached to a long reflux condenser carrying a trap. The reaction is allowed to progress spontaneously, with occasional cooling as the reaction becomes more rapid and the flask becomes filled with vapor. After the initial vigorous reaction is completed, the mixture is refluxed for one hour, during which time crystallization takes place. The mixture is then allowed to cool, the flask is removed, 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added, and the contents of the flask are then filtered with suction. The residue is washed twice with 100-cc. portions of 95 per cent alcohol and allowed to dry in air. The yield is 190 g. of a product which melts with decomposition at 235°. Another crop of crystals weighing 43 g. and melting at 230° can be obtained from the alcoholic filtrate by concentrating it to a paste to which, after cooling, is added 120 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. The total yield is 220–233 g. (79–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: Water (1.5 l.) is added and the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer, which contains the potassium salt of 3-acetyloxindole, is separated and is then extracted with ethyl ether three times to remove a purple impurity. The aqueous layer is then made acidic to litmus by addition of hydrochloric acid; this causes precipitation of crude, tan-colored 3-acetyloxindole. The mixture is chilled, and the product is collected by suction filtration and washed well on the filter with water. The yield of crude 3-acetyloxindole, m.p. 204–206°, is 65–68 g. (74–78%). It may be purified by recrystallizing it from 1.7 l. of chloroform in the presence of 2 g. of decolorizing carbon. A heated filter funnel must be used in separating the carbon because the product starts to crystallize only slightly below the boiling point of chloroform. The recrystallized 3-acetyloxindole weighs 53–59 g. (61–67%) and is in the form of white needles, m.p. 204–205.5°.

DESCRIPTION: The clear filtrate, which has only a pale yellow color, is now run, with stirring, into the cuprous chloride solution in a 12-l. flask, while the temperature is kept at 25–30°. A somewhat sticky precipitate first forms, which later becomes crystalline; nitrogen is evolved in a continuous stream. The addition requires about thirty minutes. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath under an efficient reflux condenser until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. It is then distilled in a current of steam (using the apparatus described on p. 479) until no more chloronitrobenzene passed over; 9–10 l. of distillate collects during this process. When quite cold, the water is decanted off, and the solid shaken with 1–2 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50°. The mixture is again allowed to cool, and the light yellow alkaline solution is decanted from the solid product, which is then collected on a filter, washed with a little cold water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. It boils completely at 116–117°/12 mm. or 124–125°/18 mm., and the distillate solidifies to a pale yellow solid which melts at 44–45° and weighs 430–450 g. (68–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: After stirring has been continued for two hours longer, the crock is surrounded by hot water or steam and warmed to 50° without stirring. The mixture is then allowed to stand until cool, when the aqueous layer is drawn off by means of a siphon. The upper oily layer is transferred to a 12-l. flask and distilled in a current of steam until no more oil passes over; about 10 l. of distillate is collected. The water is drawn off and the benzene removed by distillation, by means of a 2-l. round-bottomed flask and a fractionating column about 90 cm. long. When benzene no longer distils over, the distillation is continued in the same apparatus under reduced pressure, and the fraction that boils at 94–96°/20 mm. is collected. A small amount of dark-colored residue remains in the flask. The yield of almost colorless o-tolunitrile is 300–330 g. (64–70 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: (B) Ethyl Ethoxyacetate.—The ethoxyacetic acid, which should amount to about 125 g. (1.2 moles), is placed in a 750-cc. Erlenmeyer flask containing 230 cc. (3.9 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol. The flask is set in a pan filled with cold water, and dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. After the mixture becomes saturated it is allowed to stand twenty-four hours to ensure the completion of the reaction at room temperature. The solution is cooled, and a saturated solution of sodium carbonate is added cautiously and with stirring to avoid excessive foaming. The addition is continued until the mixture is faintly alkaline to litmus; an excess of sodium carbonate lowers the yield and should be avoided. The ester is extracted with four 100-cc. portions of ether; the extract is dried with 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled at ordinary pressure. The yield of ester boiling at 153–155° is 110–115 g. (55–58 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid, or 69–72 per cent based on the ethoxyacetic acid).

The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 16 hr. The mixture is recooled to 0°C, and poured into 260 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 800 mL of ice water. The mixture is extracted with three 300-mL portions of ether and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is held under high vacuum (0.03 mm) at room temperature for 3 hr to give 93.3 g (92%) of cyclobutyl tosylate as a pale-yellow oil.

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is poured into a mixture of 300 mL of toluene and 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The resulting milky solution is washed twice with 100-mL portions of deionized water and twice with 100-mL portions of brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure in a 50°C bath. The semisolid residue is slurried in 55 mL of ether and then collected by filtration on a sintered-glass funnel. After the solid is washed 4 times with 10 mL of ether, it is set aside and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The residue is slurried in 10 mL of ether. The solid is collected on a glass frit and washed twice with 10 mL of ether.

DESCRIPTION: A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and two 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnels. One of the dropping funnels is fitted with a rubber septum and the air in the system is replaced with dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 400 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 51.6 g (71.5 mL, 0.51 mol) of anhydrous diisopropylamine. The flask is cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. A 1.7 M hexane solution of butyllithium (288 mL, 0.49 mol) is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-min period. The resulting lithium diisopropylamide is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice–acetone bath. A solution of 53.9 g (0.385 mol) of 3-ethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one in 250 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise with stirring at −78°C over a 1-hr period. The solution is stirred at −78°C for 30 min followed by the rapid addition of 114 g (50 mL, 0.80 mol) of methyl iodide. After 5 min, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred overnight. The reaction is quenched with 300 mL of water and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted four times with 75 mL of diethyl ether. The organic phases are combined and washed twice with 150 mL of water, once with 150 mL of brine, and dried over magnesium sulfate.

DESCRIPTION: A. 1-[(Isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl]cyclohexanol. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a magnetic stirrer, a three-way stopcock, and a reflux condenser connected with a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is charged with magnesium turnings (2.43 g, 100 mg-atm) that are dried under a rapid stream of nitrogen with a heat gun. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the rate of nitrogen flow is reduced. Several milliliters of a solution of (isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl chloride (16.67 g, 100 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (120 mL) and about 50 μL of 1,2-dibromoethane are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature and within a few minutes an exothermic reaction starts. The remaining solution is added dropwise at room temperature over ca. 45 min at such a rate as to maintain a gently exothermic reaction. After the addition is complete, the tan-gray mixture is refluxed for 0.5 hr and then cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. A solution of freshly distilled cyclohexanone (7.36 g, 75 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL) is added dropwise with stirring over 30 min. The resultant mixture is stirred at 0°C for another 30 min and then hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of an aqueous 10% solution of ammonium chloride (100 mL) at 0°C over 10 min. The organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 40-mL portions of diethyl ether.

DESCRIPTION: B. erythrol-1-(3-Hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylpropanoyl)piperidine. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with nitrogen. One neck is connected with a balloon charged with nitrogen, and the other neck is capped with a rubber septum. Into the flask are placed 50 mL of trifluoroacetic acid and 11.9 g of 1-(2-benzoylpropanoyl)piperidine (48.7 mmol) prepared as described in Part A; then the flask is immersed in an ice–water bath. To the flask is added 7.3 g of dimethylphenylsilane (8.24 mL, 54 mmol) over a 5-min period with the aid of a 10-mL syringe, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 4 hr in the ice bath. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 200 mL of water. After the organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The crude oil is placed in a 200-mL, one-necked flask and dissolved in 100 mL of methanolic 1 M sodium hydroxide. The solution is stirred for 1.5 hr at ambient temperature with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual oil is subjected to column chromatography using 100 g of silica gel. After the first fraction (800t mL) of hexane is eluted, the second fraction, eluted with 500 mL of diethyl ether, is collected and concentrated. Recrystallization of the resulting oil from diethyl ether–hexane gives 10.2 g of material, mp 85–86°C. The yield is 90%.

DESCRIPTION: When cool, the reaction mixture is poured slowly with stirring into 1 l. of ice and water. If the stirring is thorough, most of the triphenylstibine is to be found in the ether layer. The hydrolysis mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel and the residue on the filter extracted three times with 100-cc. portions of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted twice with 200-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether portions are evaporated slowly on a steam bath to remove the ether, and there remains behind a yellow semi-solid which crystallizes to a white solid on cooling. The yield of crude product melting at 49° is 145–160 g. (82–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). For purification from a small amount of biphenyl which is present in the crude product, 90 g. of triphenylstibine is dissolved in 200 cc. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–50°) by warming on a steam bath. There is generally a small amount of insoluble residue which is filtered and the filtrate cooled in a freezing mixture. The triphenylstibine separates as small prisms and weighs 58–65 g.; by further concentration of the filtrate to an approximate volume of 50 cc. and then cooling again, an additional 15–20 g. of product separates. Both portions melt at 50°.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a tube to carry off hydrogen chloride and acetic acid vapors, are placed 915 cc. of glacial acetic acid, 327 g. (5 gram atoms) of zinc dust, and 352 g. (1 mole) of cetyl iodide (m.p. 20–22°) (p. 322). The mixture is saturated with dry hydrogen chloride and then stirred and heated on a steam bath. At the end of every five hours of heating, the mixture is again saturated with hydrogen chloride. After the reaction has proceeded for twenty-five hours, the mixture is allowed to cool, and the layer of hexadecane, which rises to the top of the reaction mixture, is separated. The residue is poured into 3 l. of water and filtered on a Büchner funnel to remove the zinc dust. The zinc dust is washed with 500 cc. of water and then with 250 cc. of ether. The combined water layers are extracted with two 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and added to the hexadecane, and the resulting solution is washed with two 250-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide and then with water until free of alkali. The ether solution is dried with 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled from a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. The yield of n-hexadecane boiling at 156–158°/14 mm. and melting at 16–17° is 192 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount).

(0.67 mole) of acetophenone, 60 ml. of ether, and 100 ml. of water. The apparatus is assembled in a well-ventilated hood, the flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and 82 g. (1.67 moles) of granulated sodium cyanide is added all at once with vigorous stirring. When most of the sodium cyanide has dissolved and the temperature of the mixture has fallen to 5°, 140 ml. (1.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains between 5° and 10°. The addition requires about 1.7 hours. After all the acid has been added, the cooling bath is removed and vigorous stirring is continued for 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to settle, and the liquid portion is decanted into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The water layer is returned to the reaction flask, and 100 ml. of water is added to dissolve the salts. The aqueous solution is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of ether, and the original ether layer and extracts are combined in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. The ether is distilled at 20–30 mm. pressure (water aspirator), and the residual oil is poured slowly with stirring into 160 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture then is saturated with hydrogen chloride gas in the hood and and allowed to stand overnight.

DESCRIPTION: B. 2-Cyano-6-methylpyridine. In a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing, dropping funnel without a stopper, and a thermometer-gas inlet adapter fitted with a thermometer which reaches deep into the flask is placed a solution of 147 g. (3.0 mole) of sodium cyanide dissolved in 400 ml. of water. The stirrer is started and the apparatus is flushed with prepurified nitrogen for 1 hour. The solution in the flask is then cooled to 0° with an ice bath, and a solution of 235 g. (1.0 mole) of 1-methoxy-2-methylpyridinium methyl sulfate dissolved in 300 ml. of water is added dropwise over a period of 2 hours. The dropping funnel and the thermometer-adapter are then quickly removed and replaced by stoppers, and the flask is allowed to stand in a refrigerator overnight (12–16 hours). The flask, containing needles of the crude nitrile, is removed from the refrigerator and the contents stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. After addition of 200 ml. of chloroform, the contents of the flask are transferred to a large separatory funnel and the layers separated. Extraction of the aqueous phase is repeated twice with 100-ml. portions of chloroform, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent by filtration, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to remove chloroform, and the residual crude cyanopicoline (90–110 g.) is transferred, while hot, to a distilling flask. Distillation under reduced pressure (30 mm.) gives three fractions: Fraction I, b.p. 99–106°, weighs 15–20 g.; Fraction II, b.p. 106–124°, weighs 5–10 g.; and Fraction III, b.p. 125–131°, weighs 60–70 g.. Fraction III is dissolved in 1 l. of hot 10% ethyl alcohol, treated with 0.5 g. of activated carbon, filtered, and the filtrate is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.

After the addition of the bromine the reaction mixture is stirred for one-half hour and then warmed on the steam bath (internal temperature about 85°) for one hour in order to remove as much of the excess bromine as possible. The last traces of bromine are removed by passing a stream of air into the reaction mixture, which then has a yellow or brown color. The mixture is treated with 1.1 l. of cold water, stirred until cool, and allowed to stand in ice, or in an ice chest, overnight. The pale yellow crystalline product is collected on a 19-cm. Büchner funnel and washed first with 500 cc. of 50 per cent aqueous acetic acid and then thoroughly with water. It is dried in an oven at 40–60° or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide. The yield is 570–583 g. (96–98 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a nearly colorless product melting with decomposition at 138–140°.

DESCRIPTION: B. 3,5-Dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and set upon a steam bath are placed 315 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate hydrate and 600 ml. of Claisen's alkali. Saponification is brought to completion by heating on the steam bath for 1 hour. A yellow homogeneous solution results which is diluted with 400 ml. of water and acidified to Congo red paper by pouring it into a rapidly stirred solution of 320 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 380 ml. of water in a 4-l. beaker. The thick white slurry is then cooled to 0–10°; the acid is collected on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with two 250-ml. portions of cold water. After being freed from as much water as possible by suction, the filter cake is broken up and dissolved in a boiling mixture of 1 l. of ethanol and 350 ml. of water. Cooling to 0° gives the first crop of crystals, weighing about 200 g. Concentration of the mother liquors to 750 ml. and cooling to 0° yields an additional 40–50 g. of product of equal purity. After drying in an oven at 85–95° for 8 hours, the white crystalline acid weighs 240–250 g. (93–97%) and melts at 266–268°.

DESCRIPTION: (B) 2,6-Dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide.—The chlorostannate is conveniently oxidized in two batches. In a 3-l. flask is placed a solution of 115 g. (2.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 175 cc. of water, 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and 108 g. (1.52 moles) of chlorine gas is passed into the mixture. About 80 per cent of the ice is melted by the operation. In a 5-l. flask 110 g. (0.127 mole) of the tin salt of 2,6-dibromo-4-aminophenol is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water and 12 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Solution is effected by warming the mixture to 40–50°, after which it is cooled to 15–17° and 600 g. of ice is added. The sodium hypochlorite solution is then added all at once with vigorous stirring (Hood). A yellow precipitate of 2,6-dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide separates immediately, and chlorine is evolved. As soon as the sodium hypochlorite solution has been stirred in, 120 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added in order to keep the tin salts in solution. The fine, yellow precipitate is filtered under the hood on a Büchner funnel and washed with 1.5 l. of 5 per cent hydrochloric acid to remove tin salts and chlorine. The product is dried on a glass tray at 30–40°, or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide. From two such batches the yield of chloroimide melting at 80–82° is 126–130 g. (84–87 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the weight of 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol used in Part A).

DESCRIPTION: In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube is placed 82 g. (3.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings. A solution of 459 g. (6 moles) of dry, freshly distilled allyl chloride in 2.4 l. of anhydrous ether is added to the flask through the dropping funnel in the following manner: A 100- to 200-ml. portion of the solution and a small crystal of iodine are added, and the mixture is warmed, if necessary, until the reaction starts. The remainder of the solution is added with stirring and cooling in an ice bath as rapidly as possible without loss of material through the condenser. By sponging the upper part of the flask with ice water from the cooling bath, the addition can be completed in 1–1.5 hours.

DESCRIPTION: A. 1,5-Hexadien-3-ol. In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel and an ice-water condenser are placed 153.0 g. (6.28 g. atoms) of magnesium turnings, 360 ml. of anhydrous ether, and a few crystals of iodine. A solution of 351.0 g. (2.90 moles) of allyl bromide in 2.6 l. of ether is added in small portions until the reaction begins, and then at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing of the ether. The addition requires about 3 hours, after which the reaction mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for an additional hour. Acrolein (104.0 g., 1.86 moles) is added during 2 hours, and this causes gentle refluxing. After an additional hour at room temperature the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 2 l. of ice water. The precipitate is dissolved by adding slowly a solution of 120 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 400 ml. of water. The organic layer is separated and the water layer extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are dried over 8–10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether, the residue is distilled through a 6-in. column packed with glass helices to yield 104–108 g.

DESCRIPTION: When one-half the sodium cyanide solution has been added, all the ammonium chloride will be in solution. At this point, the addition of 380 cc. of glacial acetic acid is started at such a rate (2–2.5 cc. per minute) that the addition of both the acid and the remainder of the sodium cyanide solution will be completed at the same time. The methyleneaminoacetonitrile begins to separate in white crystals shortly after the addition of the glacial acetic acid has commenced. After all the sodium cyanide solution and acetic acid have been added, the mixture is stirred for one and one-half hours longer; then the precipitate is filtered off, transferred to a beaker, and stirred with 1.5 l. of water. The product is filtered with suction, washed with 500 cc. of water, and dried on filter paper. The yield is 410–475 g. (61–71 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 129°,, and.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.—In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide. The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234–238°, amounts to 80–90 g. (66–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser is placed a solution of 1 g. of iodine in 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. One hundred grams (0.27 mole) of benzopinacol is added, and the flask is heated over a wire gauze, with shaking, until the solution boils gently. It is then refluxed for five minutes during which the solid benzopinacol disappears completely and a clear red solution is obtained. The solution is transferred at once to a 1-l. beaker, and, upon cooling, the benzopinacolone separates in fine threads. The product is filtered with suction, washed with two or three 60-cc. portions of cold glacial acetic acid until colorless, and dried. The filtrate is reserved for subsequent preparations. The yield of practically pure benzopinacolone melting at 178–179° is 90–91 g. (95–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a purer product is desired the material may be dissolved in 450 cc. of hot benzene, filtered, and treated with 250 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–100°). After cooling in ice the benzopinacolone is filtered and dried. The purified product weighs 82–83 g. and melts at 179–180°.

DESCRIPTION: C. Methyl n-hexylcarbamate. In a dry, 100-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, to which a calcium chloride drying tube is attached, are placed a boiling chip, 14.8 g. (0.0622 mole) of the inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide, and 6.0 g. (0.058 mole) of freshly distilled 1-hexanol. After a mildly exothermic reaction (occasionally there is a 5-minute induction period), the viscous, yellow reaction mixture is heated with an oil bath at 95° for 1 hour. The mixture is cooled to 30°, diluted with 50 ml. of water, and extracted with three 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic extracts are combined, washed successively with 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid and 50 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

DESCRIPTION: B. 1-Chloro-N,N,2-trimethylpropenylamine. The flask is equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser protected from moisture with a sulfuric acid trap. The iminium chloride is suspended in 200 ml. of anhydrous dichloromethane, and 140 g. (1.39 moles) of triethylamine is slowly added to the mixture from the dropping funnel, with vigorous stirring, over 1 hour. The temperature rises to 45°, and the solvent begins to reflux. The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 hours, after which 150 ml. of dry, low-boiling petroleum ether is added to complete the precipitation of triethylamine hydrochloride. The mixture is quickly filtered under nitrogen into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask through an Iena sintered-glass filter. A 300-ml. portion of petroleum ether is used to wash the flask and the triethylamine hydrochloride on the filter. The solvent is removed by distillation under nitrogen. Further distillation through a Vigreux column under nitrogen gives 93–103 g. (69–77%) of 1-chloro-N,N,2-trimethylpropenylamine, b.p. 125–130° (760 mm.) and. The compound is very sensitive to humidity and should be immediately stored in ampoules.

DESCRIPTION: After six hours, the solution is cooled to room temperature and a cold solution of 192 g. (4.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 350 cc. of water is poured down the side of the flask so that most of it settles to the bottom without mixing with the solution in the flask.

DESCRIPTION: A. 9-Tetradecylcarbazole (1). A single-necked 500-mL, round-bottomed, side-armed flask equipped with a glass stopper and a magnetic stirring bar is connected to a nitrogen-vacuum manifold. After evacuating and backfilling with nitrogen three times, the flask (with stopper removed), in which a positive flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is sequentially charged with carbazole (12.5 g, 0.072 mol), 1-bromotetradecane (24.3 mL, 0.079 mol), THF (60 mL) and DMF (20 mL). To the stirred solution, NaH (60% in oil, 4.32 g, 0.11 mol) is added to the solution in small portions within 20 min, avoiding vigorous bubbling and heating. The flask is capped with a glass stopper and the resulting suspension is stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen.

DESCRIPTION: B. Lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two glass stoppers and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a gas inlet connected to an argon-vacuum manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. After evacuating and backfilling with argon three times, the flask is charged with substituted aniline 1 (11.3 g, 63.7 mmol) and n-hexane (220 mL) under argon purge. The solution is cooled to −78 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath and a solution of n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 48 mL, 76.8 mmol) is added via the dropping funnel over 10 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 12 h during which time it is gradually warmed to room temperature; a white precipitate forms upon warming. The dropping funnel is replaced by a distillation head and condenser and all volatiles are removed under vacuum (approximately 7.5 mmHg) at room temperature without exposing the contents to the open atmosphere. Then ether (25 mL) and n-hexane (50 mL) are added to the remaining viscous liquid causing further precipitation of a white solid. The resulting suspension is kept at −30 °C under argon for 12 h. The white solids of lithium anilide etherate (2•Et2O) formed are collected by filtration under argon, washed with cold n-hexane (2 × 10 mL) and dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) to give lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate as colorless crystals (9.41 g, 57%).

DESCRIPTION: A mixture of 212 g. (1 mole) of benzoin, 110 g. (1.8 moles) of urea and 800 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask is heated under a reflux condenser for seven hours. The hot solution is quickly poured into a 2-l. beaker and allowed to stand at least three hours. The cold mixture is then transferred by means of a large wooden spoon or spatula to a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible with the help of a rubber dam. The crystals are pressed down during the suction filtration. The filtrate is discarded. The crystals are returned to the beaker, stirred mechanically with 500 cc. of ether for thirty minutes, filtered again by suction, and spread out to dry at least overnight. The product is dissolved by heating with 1 l. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser, and the clear solution is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2.5 l. of water in a 4-l. (1-gal.) crock. Stirring is continued for thirty minutes. The mixture is filtered on a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The crystals are transferred to the 2-l. beaker and stirred mechanically for ten minutes with 1 l. of water. After filtration, the washing with water is repeated. The product is then returned to the beaker, stirred with 750 cc. of ether, and filtered again. The material is then air-dried to constant weight. The yield of white fluffy crystals of diphenylglyoxalone melting at 330–335° (corr.) is 220–230 g. (93–97 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: In a 500-cc. three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer, are placed 45.5 g. (0.25 mole) of 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 85 g. (1.5 moles) of iron, and 100 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol. The mixture is heated to boiling on a water bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 5.2 cc. (0.06 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 25 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol is added slowly. The mixture is refluxed for two hours after addition of the acid is complete. At the end of this time the apparatus is disconnected and the hot mixture is made just alkaline to litmus by the addition of the calculated amount of 15 per cent alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution. Without allowing the mixture to cool, the iron is removed by filtration and the reaction flask is rinsed with two 50-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; the same alcohol is used to wash the iron residue. To the filtrate is added 84 cc. of 6 N sulfuric acid; the normal sulfate of 2,4-diaminotoluene precipitates. The mixture is cooled to 25° and filtered by suction. The product is washed with two 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, dried in the air for two hours and then dried to constant weight at 110°. The yield is 49 g.

DESCRIPTION: Three hundred grams of β-naphthol (2.1 moles) is converted into nitroso-β-naphthol (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 411), and the product is transferred to a 6-l. (1.5 gal.) crock which is wide enough to admit the Büchner funnel (30-cm.) employed. A cold solution of 600 g. (5.8 moles) of sodium bisulfite and 100 cc. of 6 N sodium hydroxide solution in 2 l. of water is used to rinse the material adhering to the funnel into the crock. The mixture is diluted with water to 4–4.5 l. and stirred until solution of the nitroso-β-naphthol is complete (about fifteen minutes). The dark solution is siphoned onto a large Büchner funnel and filtered by suction, thus removing a small amount of tarry material which is always present. The clear, yellowish brown filtrate is transferred to an 8- to 10-l. wide-mouthed bottle and diluted with water to 7 l. While the solution is vigorously stirred, 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is poured slowly down the walls of the bottle; the mixture is then placed in the hood and protected from the light. The temperature rises from 20–25° to 35–40° at once and to about 50° in the course of two hours, when the reaction is nearly complete. After standing for a total of five hours or more, the precipitate, which sets to a stiff paste in the bottle, is collected on a filter. The residue is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and washed with 200 cc. of water. The mixture is filtered, and the residue is washed with 300 cc. of water on the filter. The moist material weighs 700–800 g. No appreciable decomposition takes place on drying the product to constant weight at 120°. A light powder of fine, gray needles is thus obtained. The yield is 410–420 g. (82–84 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the β-naphthol used).

DESCRIPTION: The reaction mixture is concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure. At first the solvent may be distilled rapidly, but, after the mixture becomes syrupy, the distillation should be carried out below 30° until the residue is almost solid. At a pressure of 10 mm. the concentration requires about 2 hours. The residue is diluted with 500 ml. of cold water, which should be added in several portions with thorough shaking to break up all the lumps. The product is collected on a filter and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid until the filtrate comes through colorless.

DESCRIPTION: The crude product is purified by recrystallization from hot ordinary methyl alcohol. On account of the low solubility of the dinitroanisole in hot methyl alcohol, the best results are obtained by boiling the crude product with a few grams of decolorizing carbon (Norite) in about 500 cc. of methyl alcohol, filtering the hot solution through a hot funnel, cooling the solution, filtering, and using the mother liquors for another extraction. After five extractions no more of the product is dissolved. The yield of pure product melting at 105° is 29–35 g. (63–77 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: Thirty grams (0.14 mole) of 2-methyldodecanoic acid is brominated exactly as described in the preparation of 2-methylenedodecanoic acid (p.616). The crude product, after the 18-hour heating period, is allowed to cool; then 56 ml.

The resultant pale-orange two-phase mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 15 minutes, cooled, and diluted with 150 ml. of water containing about 2 g. of sodium sulfite. The bromo ester is extracted with two portions (75 ml. and 25 ml.) of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation of the filtered solution from a 250-ml. flask heated on a steam bath, and the last traces of solvent are eliminated by reducing the pressure with a water aspirator.

The mechanical stirrer, fitted with a 60 X 20 mm Teflon paddle, is started at 120–150 rpm. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one (29.9 g, 112 mmol) is dissolved in 50 mL of 2-propanol (gentle heating is required) and added to the reaction flask, rinsing with an additional 50 mL, then 20 mL of 2-propanol. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the solution for 15 min. The septum is removed and replaced with a glass funnel, through which 10% Pd/C (5.98 g, 50% w/w in water) is added, the septum is replaced, and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The septum is removed again, replaced with a glass funnel, and sodium formate is added in a single portion (38.1 g, 559 mmol, 5.0 equiv, Note 3), rinsing with 25 mL of 2-propanol The septum is replaced and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The flask is heated in an oil bath to an internal temperature of 80 °C, and is maintained at this temperature with stirring for 18 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and a 60-μL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 μL of ether. A 4-μL sample of this solution is analyzed by GC, and shows complete conversion. The slurry is filtered with suction through a pad of Celite (8 cm diameter sintered glass funnel, 350 mL volume, with a 4 cm pad of Celite), into a 1-L filter flask rinsing with four 50-mL portions of 2-propanol. The filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to a cloudy, yellow oil, which is then diluted with 150 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, Note 3) and then is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with three portions of half-saturated brine (75 mL each), once with saturated brine, then is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a clear, orange oil (17.2 g, 86.7 mmol, 77% yield) with traces of MTBE and 2-propanol. This material is used without further purification in the next reaction.

DESCRIPTION: C. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione. A three-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal temperature probe, 50-mL addition funnel with nitrogen inlet, a septum with nitrogen outlet and magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen and charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]-heptan-6-one (17.1 g, 81.0 mmol) and 33 mL each of 2-propanol and water. The solution is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 °C with an ice-water bath, and 26 mL of 2:1 water-acetic acid (v/v) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 30 min. At this rate of addition, the internal temperature remains below 5 °C throughout the addition. The solution is then allowed to stir for 16 h and gradually come to room temperature. A 60-μL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 μL of ether from which a 4-μL sample is used for GC analysis, which shows complete conversion to cycloheptane-1,3-dione. The reaction mixture is poured into 200 mL of MTBE in a 500-mL separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with an additional 100 mL of MTBE. The organic solutions are combined, washed with 50 mL of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration through cotton, rinsing with 50 mL MTBE and concentration on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 °C water bath) provides the crude product as a clear, amber oil. 1H NMR analysis shows the diketone contaminated with residual MTBE and acetic acid. The oil is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, and treated with 22.5 g of silica gel. Concentration on the rotary evaporator provides a tan, free-flowing solid, which is placed on the top of a 7.5 × 23 cm column of silica gel packed as a slurry in hexane/Et2O, 2:1. The column is eluted with hexane/Et2O, 2:1 (500 mL) and 1:1 (3.8 L), followed by combination of the product-containing fractions (TLC in hexane/Et2O, 1:1, visualization with p-anisaldehyde stain). The combined fractions are concentrated via rotary evaporator, under vacuum (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide cycloheptane-1,3-dione as a clear, pale-yellow oil (6.69 g, 53.1 mmol, 61% yield). This material is approximately 95% pure as determined by 1H NMR analysis and is suitable for most subsequent uses, although the chromatographed material fails combustion analysis. If necessary, further purification can be achieved by short path vacuum distillation.

DESCRIPTION: B. Methyl 2-(diethylphosphoryloxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate. A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a gas inlet tube connected to a nitrogen source and a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 1.58 g (0.0329 mol) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil. The sodium hydride is freed from the mineral oil by washing with four 40-mL portions of anhydrous diethyl ether and withdrawing the supernatant solvent with a syringe, after which 120 mL of anhydrous ether is added. The mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice bath as 4.68 g (0.0300 mol) of methyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate in 10 mL of ether is added at a moderately rapid rate such that vigorous but controlled evolution of hydrogen occurs. The resulting creamy suspension is stirred at 0°C for another 30 min, after which time 4.5 mL (5.37 g, 0.031 mol) of diethyl chlorophosphate is injected through the septum with a syringe. The ice bath is removed, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr, and 0.6 g of solid ammonium chloride is added. Stirring is continued for 30 min, and the salts are then separated by suction filtration through a medium porosity fritted-glass funnel. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure affords 8.18–8.63 g of the enol phosphate that is used in Step C without purification.

Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 °C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 °C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 °C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.

DESCRIPTION: The residual liquid in the flask is allowed to cool, and a cold solution of 320 g. (3.3 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 450 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel. This should be done slowly and with stirring in order to prevent foaming. The solution becomes hot and may reflux spontaneously. After all the sulfuric acid has been added the solution is refluxed for about three hours. A layer of organic acid appears and the reflux condenser is replaced by an automatic separator. The solution is distilled with the separator attached, and the aqueous portion is returned to the distilling flask. This operation is continued until practically all the organic acid has been driven over; from ten to fifteen hours is required. At the end, about 100 cc. of water is collected in the separator and extracted with ether in order to remove the dissolved acid. The ether is distilled; the crude acid is mixed with an equal volume of dry benzene and distilled from a modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. Benzene and water distil first and then 3-methylpentanoic acid distils at 193–196°/743 mm. The yield is 66–69 g. (62–65 per cent of the theoretical amount).

O-Trimethylsilylquinidine ( 4 , O-TMS QND) .3 A 250-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer (PTFE stirrer blade 1.9 × 6 cm) is flame-dried with a stream of nitrogen and left to cool down to ambient temperature for 10 min. To the flask are added quinidine (4.00 g, 12.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and CH2Cl2 (100 mL) followed by distilled trimethylsilyl chloride (1.9 mL, 15 mmol, 1.2 equiv), which is added slowly via syringe pump over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred at ambient temperature for 24 h and then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, to which was added CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and NaHCO3 (aq) (100 mL). After shaking, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is reextracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 °C). The residue is then left to dry under reduced pressure at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h at 23 °C to afford 4.02 g (82%) of O-trimethylsilylquinidine (4) as a clear oil, which was of sufficient purity for use without purification.

DESCRIPTION: After all the ester-ketone mixture has been added and the reaction has subsided, the ice bath is removed and replaced by a steam bath. The crust on the mixture is broken up and the mixture heated on a steam bath until all the sodium has reacted (30–60 minutes). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is poured with stirring onto 300 g. of crushed ice. Ninety-five milliliters of glacial acetic acid in 350 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes. The organic layer which separates is removed by means of a separatory funnel, and the water layer is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the original organic material, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. To the residue are added 150 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, after which it is allowed to cool to room temperature.

DESCRIPTION: Into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are introduced 100 g. (0.385 mole) of technical grade triphenylcarbinol, 105 g. (0.81 mole) of dry aniline hydrochloride, and 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The mixture is heated at the reflux temperature for 3 hours. During the period of reflux a clear brown homogeneous solution is formed. The solution while still hot is poured with stirring into a 4-l. beaker containing 2 l. of water. p-Aminotetraphenylmethane hydrochloride, which is not very soluble in water, separates as a light-brown solid. It is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 1 l. of water. The solid is then put back into the beaker, and a solution of 40 g. of sodium hydroxide in 2 l. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling for 1 hour to convert the hydrochloride to the free base, which likewise is not very soluble in water. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered with suction through a Büchner funnel. The solid material is washed with 500 ml. of water and is dried in an oven at 110–120°.

DESCRIPTION: For purification, 200 g. of the crude product is suspended in 1 l. of hot water and treated with a solution of 88 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water. The solution is stirred mechanically and the isatin passes into solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then added, with stirring, until a slight precipitate appears. This requires about 290–300 cc. of an acid made by diluting one volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with two volumes of water. The mixture is then filtered at once, the precipitate is rejected, and the filtrate is made acid to Congo red paper with hydrochloric acid. The solution is then cooled rapidly, and the isatin which separates is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The pure product thus obtained weighs 150–170 g. and and melts at 197–200° (corr.).

The united oil and extract are dried with a small quantity of calcium chloride and distilled, first under atmospheric pressure to remove the benzene, and finally under reduced pressure. The m-nitrotoluene passes over entirely at 113–114°/15 mm. On cooling, it forms a pale yellow solid which melts at 16°. The yield of pure material is 95–110 g.

DESCRIPTION: After the bromine has been added the ether and dissolved hydrogen bromide are removed at once under reduced pressure with a slight current of air. The phenacyl bromide remains as a solid mass of brownish yellow crystals; the color is removed by shaking with a mixture of 10 cc. of water and 10 cc. of petroleum ether.

DESCRIPTION: The aqueous distillate is treated with 650 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated on a steam bath, under reduced pressure, until the residual liquor becomes a syrupy mass. This is desiccated further by adding 150 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol and evaporating under reduced pressure. Two or three such treatments with alcohol dry the crystalline material sufficiently so that it no longer sticks to the sides of the flask. The crude product is dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride. The pale yellow, dry, crystalline solid weighs 200–215 g. (77–83 per cent of the theoretical amount). The dried product may be purified by dissolving it in an equal weight of boiling absolute ethyl alcohol and then chilling in an ice bath. The yield of pure white crystals melting at 81–82° is 180–190 g. (69–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).

DESCRIPTION: The solvent and excess dimethyl carbonate are removed by rotary evaporation, and the remaining yellow liquid (13.2 g of 2) is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (10%, 60 mL) is added to the flask, and the mixture is heated with magnetic stirring in an oil bath at reflux temperature for 4.5 hr. The course of the reaction is monitored by gas-chromatographic analysis. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is extracted with diethyl ether to remove nonacidic material (primarily traces of amide). An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (15%, 50 mL) is added portionwise. The suspension that forms is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (60 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the yellow liquid residue is distilled from a 25-mL flask, under reduced pressure, in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 2-cm Vigreux column and a fused-on Liebig condenser. Distillation affords 2-phenylpropionic acid (3) (14.3 g, 93%) as a pale-yellow liquid, bp 93-94°C/0.9 mm (lit.2 bp 147°C/11 mm), with > 98% purity by gas chromatography.

DESCRIPTION: C. L-Allylglycine . A 1-L, single-neck, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient reflux condenser, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a heating mantle is charged with 25.0 g (0.0953 mol) of pseudoephedrine L-allylglycinamide and 500 mL of water. The resulting suspension is heated to reflux, causing the solids to dissolve to afford a colorless, homogeneous solution. After 10 hr at reflux, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 23°C, whereupon (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine is observed to crystallize. Concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution (10 mL) is added, whereupon the resulting aqueous slurry is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with three 200-mL portions of dichloromethane , reserving the aqueous layer. The three organic layers are individually and sequentially extracted with a single aqueous solution prepared by combining 250 mL of water and 5 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution. The aqueous extract is combined with the aqueous extract reserved earlier and the resulting solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to provide a white solid residue. The solid is triturated, sequentially, with one 100-mL and one 50-mL portion of absolute ethanol . The triturated solid is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to afford 10.2 g (93%) of L-allylglycine of ≥99% ee. If desired, (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine can be recovered from the organic extracts. The organic extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a solid. The solid is recrystallized by dissolving it in a minimum volume of hot water (ca. 350 mL). The resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23°C, by which time extensive crystallization of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine has occurred. The recrystallization flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. After standing at 0°C for 1 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to afford 10.8 g of pure (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine (mp 116-117°C).

The resulting slurry is heated to reflux whereupon a clear, colorless homogeneous solution is obtained. After 2 hr at reflux, the reaction mixture is cooled to 23°C, inducing the crystallization of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine. The reaction suspension is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted sequentially with one 200-mL and one 100-mL portion of dichloromethane , reserving the aqueous layer. The two organic layers are individually and sequentially extracted with a single 150-mL portion of water. The aqueous layer is combined with the earlier aqueous extract and the resulting solution is reserved. If desired, (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine can be recovered from the organic extracts, as follows. The organic extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a solid.

DESCRIPTION: A. (R,R)-(−)-Pseudoephedrine glycinamide. An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an argon inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 150-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with argon and charged with 30.8 g (0.726 mol, 2 equiv) of anhydrous lithium chloride, 60.0 g (0.363 mol, 1 equiv) of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine, and 500 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). The resulting slurry is cooled in an ice bath. After 15 min, 6.89 g (0.182 mol, 0.5 equiv) of solid lithium methoxide is added to the reaction flask in one lot. The resulting mixture is stirred at 0°C for 10 min, after which time the pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with a solution of 40.4 g (0.454 mol, 1.25 equiv) of glycine methyl ester in 100 mL of dry THF, and dropwise addition of this solution is initiated. The addition is completed within 1 hr, and the reaction flask is maintained at 0°C for an additional 7 hr. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 500 mL of water. The bulk of the THF is removed from the resulting colorless solution by concentration under reduced pressure. An additional 250 mL of water is added to the aqueous concentrate, and the resulting aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted sequentially with one 500-mL and four 250-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure.

Molybdenum trisamide 4 (5.31 g, 8.48 mmol), magnesium turnings (2.54 g, 106 mmol) and THF (160 mL) are added to the flask by removal of the septum. To the stirred solution, 1,1-dichloropropane (1.7 mL, 17 mmol) is added dropwise via syringe within 5 min, resulting in a color change from red to dark amber. The resulting mixture is stirred for 2.5 h at room temperature under argon. The rubber septum is replaced by a distillation head connected to the vacuum line, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure (approximately 7.5 mmHg), and the residue is redissolved in pentane (100 mL). After vigorous stirring/manual shaking, the solid precipitate (MgCl2) and excess magnesium turnings are removed by filtration under argon. The filtrate is concentrated to approximately 1/10 of its volume and slowly cooled to −78 °C, causing the molybdenum propylidyne complex to precipitate. The supernatant is removed via cannula and the remaining beige crystals are dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) (3.08 g, 54%).

DESCRIPTION: A 1-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 145 g. (1.00 mole) of 2-phenylbutyronitrile, 2.3 g. (0.010 mole) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and 50 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide. The gas-inlet tube is adjusted to extend below the surface of the liquid, and a gas-exit tube is attached to the flask. A slow stream of acetylene is passed through the gas-inlet tube into the flask, removing the air. After 5 minutes, 56 g. of finely powdered potassium hydroxide is added and stirring is begun. Acetylene is introduced at the rate of 15–20 l./hour. An exothermic reaction occurs; the temperature rises to 70–80° and is held in this range with a cold water bath. After 40–60 minutes, a warm bath is required to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture at 60–70°, and stirring is continued for an additional 20–30 minutes. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, the inlet tube is replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 500 ml. of water is added slowly. The resulting dark-brown mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed twice with 200-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene layers are combined and washed successively with 200 ml. of water, 100 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and 200 ml. of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation at reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled through a short Vigreux column, giving 125–135 g. of crude product, b.p. 115–125° (13 mm.). Redistillation of this product through a Vigreux column gives 101–107 g.

DESCRIPTION: A. α-Bromo-α-phenylacetone. A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a water-cooled reflux condenser provided with a short inverted U-tube on the open end; the equipment is assembled in the hood. In the flask are placed 200 ml. of dry, thiophene-free benzene and 37 g. (36.89 ml., 0.276 mole) of phenylacetone. The stirrer is started, and 45 g. (14.42 ml., 0.28 mole) of reagent bromine is added dropwise during a period of 1 hour. The reaction mixture first becomes cloudy but changes to a clear orange-red solution by the time all the bromine is added. After the addition of bromine is complete, a rapid stream of dry nitrogen or carbon dioxide is passed through the solution by means of an inlet tube which now replaces the dropping funnel. The hydrogen bromide issuing from the inverted U-tube at the top of the condenser may be trapped in water in an Erlenmeyer flask or other container adjusted so that the water surface is about 1 cm. below the outlet of the tube. The reaction is complete when no more hydrogen bromide fumes can be detected in the gas issuing from the condenser. This operation requires 3–6 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes yellow to green. The benzene solution of α-bromo-α-phenylacetone is then transferred to a dry 500-ml. separatory funnel.

DESCRIPTION: C. 2,2-Difluorosuccinic acid. In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel, 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 2 l. of water and 158 g. (1 mole) of potassium permanganate is then added. The mixture is cooled to 15–20° with an ice-salt bath, and 107 g. (0.75 mole) of 1-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutene is added through the dropping funnel during 1 hour while the permanganate solution is stirred and maintained at 15–20°. After the solution has been stirred for 2 hours more at this temperature, the manganese dioxide is removed by filtration and rinsed with three 300-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to a volume of 500 ml. by evaporation on a steam bath. The solution is then cooled and 85 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly with stirring. The cold solution is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. Drying of the ether extract is accomplished by agitating it for 5 minutes with 30 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. When the drying agent has been removed by filtration and rinsed with ether, the filtrate and the ether washings are combined and concentrated to give 91–97 g. (79–84%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid. The acid is recrystallized by dissolving it in hot nitromethane (1.25 ml. per g.), filtering the solution through a layer of filter aid if necessary, and cooling the solution to 3°. The crystals are collected by suction filtration and rinsed with 30 ml. of cold nitromethane. After drying, this gives 85–92 g. (74–80%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid, m.p. 144–146°.

The flask is immersed in a water bath (22 °C) and a solution of 72.2 g of crude diallyl pimelate (301 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added in a steady stream via cannula during the course of 5 min. Some moderate bubbling (hydrogen evolution) of the reaction mixture is observed during the addition. Following the addition, the suspension is heated to 40 °C and then stirred for 10 h whereupon the reaction mixture turned to a clear, yellowish solution. Once the starting material is consumed (based on TLC, Note 5), 24.3 mL of neat iodomethane (391 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added to the mixture, which became a white suspension. After an additional 15 h at 40 °C, the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature (22 °C) and water (60 mL) is added carefully via syringe over the course of 9 min to obtain a clear, yellowish solution. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, the THF is removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 150 mmHg), and the remaining solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 75 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (1 × 50 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (5 g). After filtration through cotton, the organic solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 75 mmHg) to yield a yellow liquid. The material is purified by short-path distillation until the first drop of the distillate turned yellow to give 52.9–53.0 g (270 mmol, 90% yield) of a clear, colorless liquid boiling from 69-72 °C/0.08 mmHg. GC analysis found >99% product purity.

DESCRIPTION: B. 1-Methoxymethyl-1-phenylethane. The reaction flask containing a toluene solution of chloromethyl methyl ether (250 mmol, 1.5 equiv) prepared above is immersed in a cold water bath and the contents cooled to 5–10 °C. α-Phenethyl alcohol (20 mL, 166 mmol, 1 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added in one portion. Diisopropylethylamine (36.0 mL, 208 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added to the reaction mixture dropwise over 30 min. The internal temperature of the mixture is maintained below 25 °C during and immediately after the amine addition, and once heat evolution has ceased, the reaction mixture is allowed to come to ambient temperature and then stirred for 12 h. At this time the starting material is consumed. The orange solution is diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (100 mL), and the biphasic mixture stirred vigorously for a minimum of five minutes to ensure all residual chloromethyl methyl ether is decomposed. The layers are separated and the resulting clear, colorless organic layer is washed once with water (100 mL), once with brine (100 mL), dried with MgSO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation to a clear, colorless oil. The material is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a short-path distillation head. The product is purified by distillation, collecting a single fraction (bp 60–63 °C, 0.5 mmHg) of 1-methoxymethoxy-1-phenylethane as a clear, colorless oil (26.2 g, 157 mmol, 95% yield).

DESCRIPTION: C. 4-Methylpyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet, a glass stopper, a stopcock gas inlet and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar is evacuated and flame-dried before it is flushed with argon and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The flask is charged with 1-(2-(1-propynyl)phenyl)pyrrole (4.53 g, 25 mmol), toluene (100 mL, Note 1) and InCl3 (277 mg, 1.25 mmol, Note 10) and the resulting mixture is stirred at 80 °C bath temperature for 4 h until GC analysis shows complete conversion of the substrate. For workup, the dark mixture is filtered through a pad of silica gel (5 cm × 3 cm, approximately 30 g), which is then carefully rinsed with toluene (150 mL). The crude product was obtained as a yellow solid after removal of the solvent under reduced pressure. The product is dissolved in toluene (20 mL) and this solution is adsorbed on silica gel (approximately 10 g) and the resulting slurry is evaporated to dryness. The adsorbate is placed in a Soxhlet thimble (8.0 cm × 3.5 cm) and is extracted with pentane (80 mL, Note 1) for 18 h using a Soxhlet apparatus of ca. 50 mL inner volume. Evaporation of the resulting pentane extract provides 4-methylpyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline as a pale yellow solid, which is pure enough for most applications (mp 63–65°C, ≥95% by GC, Note 11) (4.12 g, 91%). Analytically pure material is obtained by subsequent sublimation (60 °C bath temperature, 5 × 10−3 mmHg for 3.5 h, Note 13) as a white solid (3.05 g, 67%, Notes 14-16), mp 67–68 °C.

DESCRIPTION: A. trans-9,10-Dihydro-9,10-phenanthrenediol (1). Phenanthrenequinone (6 g., 0.03 mole) is placed in a fritted-glass (coarse porosity) extraction thimble of a Soxhlet apparatus over a 1-l. flask containing a suspension of 3 g. of lithium aluminum hydride in 500 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. Extraction of the quinone over a period of 16 hours affords a green solution. The reaction is quenched by the cautious addition of water and neutralized with glacial acetic acid. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed consecutively with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and water, then dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gives the crude product, which is recrystallized from benzene, giving 3.8–4.1 g. (62–68%) of pure diol 1 as fluffy, white needles, m.p. 185–190°,.

DESCRIPTION: A. Tetramethyl 3,7-dihydroxybicyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,6-diene-2,4,6,8-tetracarboxylate. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, reflux condenser, and a heating mantle. A solution of 64 g (1.60 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 1.15 L of methanol is prepared in the flask, cooled in an ice bath, and stirred as 273 g (1.57 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate is added dropwise. The resulting slurry is stirred and heated to reflux, at which point the white salt dissolves. The heating mantle is removed, and the solution is stirred rapidly while 128.5 g of aqueous 40% glyoxal (51.4 g, 0.886 mol) and is added at a rate sufficient to maintain the internal temperature at 65°C. After the addition is completed (40–60 min,), the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred overnight. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with 500 mL of methanol, and dried under reduced pressure. The yield of the white to light yellow disodium salt is 197–215 g (58–63%).

In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, carrying a separatory funnel, a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, and a thermometer, are placed 160 g. (1 mole) of ethyl malonate and 212 g. (1.05 moles) of trimethylene bromide. The thermometer is adjusted so that the bulb is immersed in the liquid in the flask; the stirrer is started, and a solution of 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of sodium in 800 ml. of absolute ethanol is added through the separatory funnel while the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at 60–65°. During the addition of the first quarter of the ethoxide solution (20 minutes) it is necessary to cool the reaction mixture occasionally in order to maintain the proper temperature, but after this point the remainder of the ethoxide solution is added just rapidly enough to keep the reaction mixture at 60–65°; this part of the addition requires about 30 minutes.

DESCRIPTION: A 500-ml. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a two-armed addition tube, one arm of which bears a reflux condenser and the other arm of which is fitted with a thermometer. t-Butyl alcohol (79 g., 1.07 moles) is added to the flask and the thermometer arranged so that its bulb is immersed in the liquid but out of the path of the stirrer. The flask is heated by means of an electric mantle until the temperature of the liquid is 80–85°, and the mantle then is removed. Anhydrous sodium acetate (0.4 g., 4.8 mmoles) is added with stirring, and then 96 g. (1.14 moles) of diketene is added dropwise over a period of 2.5 hours. The temperature of the solution drops to 60–70° during the first 15 minutes and then increases slowly to 110–115°. When all the diketene is added, the reaction subsides and, after the resulting brown-black solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, the product is distilled immediately under reduced pressure through a short column. After a small fore-run, the yield of t-butyl acetoacetate, b.p. 85°/20 mm., nD20 1.4200–1.4203, is 127–135 g. (75–80%).

DESCRIPTION: In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 82 g. (0.62 mole) of t-butyl carbazate,2 72 g. of glacial acetic acid, and 100 ml. of water. The solution is cooled in an ice bath, and 47.0 g. (0.68 mole) of solid sodium nitrite is added over a period of 40–50 minutes, the temperature being kept at 10–15°. The mixture is allowed to stand in the ice bath for 30 minutes, 100 ml. of water is added, and the floating oil is extracted into four 40-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 50-ml. portions of water and with 40-ml. portions of 1M sodium bicarbonate solution until no longer acidic (about three washings are required). The solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation from a water bath maintained at 40–45°; water aspirator pressure of 140–150 mm. is used. The pressure is then lowered to 70 mm., and the water bath temperature is raised to 90–95°. The azide is distilled (Caution!) using a Claisen flask and is collected at 73–74° (70 mm.), n24D 1.4227, after a few drops of fore-run. The yield is 57–72.8 g. (64–82%) and.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Preparation of Cuprous Cyanide.—(Note 1)—In a 6-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stopper carrying a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a gas exit tube leading to a good hood, is placed a solution of 650 g. (2.6 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate in 4 l. of water. The flask is surrounded by an oil bath and heated to about 80°. The stirrer is started and a solution of 255 g. (5.2 moles) of sodium cyanide in 650 cc. of water is added from the separatory funnel over a period of about one-half hour. Then the mixture is boiled until no more cyanogen gas is evolved. This requires about five to ten minutes.

DESCRIPTION: (A) Ethoxyacetic Acid.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser 70 to 80 cm. long, is placed 1250 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol. Through the condenser tube 69 g. (3 gram atoms) of metallic sodium is added rapidly enough to keep the alcohol refluxing gently. When the sodium has completely dissolved, a solution of 142 g. (1.5 moles) of chloroacetic acid in 180 cc. of absolute alcohol is added slowly in 20-cc. portions to the sodium ethoxide solution. After all the acid has been added, the mixture is heated gently for ten minutes. The excess alcohol is removed as completely as possible by distilling from a steam bath and finally by passing steam into the residue. The aqueous solution is cooled, and 140 cc. (1.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The sodium chloride is removed by filtration with suction and is washed with two 50-cc. portions of ether. The original filtrate is saturated with dry sodium sulfate (30–35 g.) and is then extracted with the ether which was used for washing the precipitate, together with an additional 100 cc. of ether. The ether is separated from the aqueous layer, and the latter is extracted four times with 100-cc. portions of fresh ether. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure, using a 500-cc. Claisen flask equipped with a 500-cc. receiver.

The apparatus is flushed with argon introduced through the septum and a positive pressure of argon is maintained with an argon-filled balloon. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 24 hr. After complete consumption of starting material, monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC,), the reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with EtOAc (250 mL) and water (125 mL) and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 200 mL of EtOAc and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is recrystallized from 2.5 mL of ether and 250 mL of 20% EtOAc/hexanes to afford ca. 30 g (80%) of 3 as nearly colorless crystals. A second crop totaling 5.9 g (16%, 96% in total) is also obtained.

DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stopper holding a dropping funnel and a mechanical stirrer, is placed a mixture of 275 cc. (4.3 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 275 cc. (4.9 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). This is cooled to 10° in a freezing mixture, and 100 g. (0.85 mole) of benzyl cyanide (free from alcohol and water) is run in slowly, at such a rate that the temperature remains at about 10° and does not exceed 20°. After all the benzyl cyanide has been added (about one hour), the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for one hour and then poured onto 1200 g. of crushed ice. A pasty mass slowly separates; more than half of this mass is p-nitrobenzyl cyanide, the other constituents being o-nitrobenzyl cyanide, and a variable amount of an oil which resists hydrolysis; apparently no dinitro compounds are formed. The mass is filtered on a porcelain funnel with suction, pressed well to remove as much oil as possible, and dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol.
