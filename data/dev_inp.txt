A. (1S,2R)-Indene oxide . A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, a 125-mL addition funnel, and a thermocouple is charged with indene ((Note 1), 29.0 g, 0.25 mol, 1 equiv), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (30 mL), (S,S)-(N,N')-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediaminomanganese(III) chloride (0.953 g, 1.5 mmol, 0.6 mol% ,), and 4-phenylpyridine N-oxide ((Note 3), 1.28 g, 7.5 mmol, 3.0 mol%) under a nitrogen (N2) atmosphere. The resulting brown mixture is cooled to −5°C, and then a cold sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution (191 mL, 1.7 M, 1.3 equiv,) is added slowly with vigorous stirring while maintaining the reaction temperature between 0°C and 2°C. Upon complete addition of the bleach, the reaction is stirred for an additional 1 hr at 0°C. At this point, hexanes (200 mL) are added in one portion with stirring, and the reaction mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite on a large Büchner funnel. The filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL), and the filtrate is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer is removed, and the brown organic layer is washed with aqueous saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution (100 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. A small amount of calcium hydride (CaH2) (100 mg) is added to the brown residue, and the epoxide is isolated by short path vacuum distillation, bp 58-60°C (0.025 mm), to yield 24.0 g of epoxyindane (84-86% ee) as a colorless to slightly yellow liquid (0.197 mol, 71% yield,,, and).
A 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser attached to a hydrogen chloride absorption trap,1 and a very sturdy mechanical stirrer, which may be of the mercury-sealed or rubber-sleeve type. In the flask are placed 350 ml. of dry carbon disulfide and 80 g. (0.48 mole) of fluorene. The stirrer is started, and, after the fluorene has dissolved, 128 g. (0.96 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is added in one portion. In the dropping funnel is placed 49.4 g. (0.48 mole) of redistilled acetic anhydride, and about 1 ml. of it is added dropwise to the vigorously stirred dark red reaction mixture. If the reaction does not start immediately it is initiated by warming the reaction flask in a water bath. After the reaction has started, the balance of the acetic anhydride is added at such a rate that the carbon disulfide refluxes gently; about 45–55 minutes is required. When approximately one-half of the acetic anhydride has been added an addition complex separates as a heavy mass which makes stirring very difficult. However, stirring must be maintained to prevent excessive local reaction at the point of introduction of the acetic anhydride. The mixture is stirred and refluxed on the water bath for an hour after the addition of the acetic anhydride is complete.
Five hundred grams (2.6 moles) of technical p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is ground in a mortar to break up all lumps. Three liters of water is placed in a 12-l. crock provided with a large brass stirrer and a tube for passing steam directly into the liquid. Dry steam is passed into the water until the temperature reaches 70°. The steam is then shut off and 400 g. (5.5–6.1 atoms) of zinc dust (90 to 100 per cent pure) is added. The sulfonyl chloride is then added in small portions by means of a porcelain spoon. The addition takes about ten minutes. The temperature rises to about 80°. Stirring is continued for ten minutes after the last of the chloride has been added. Steam is then passed into the mixture until the temperature reaches 90°. If it is heated any hotter, bumping takes place. The steam is shut off, and 250 cc. of 12 N sodium hydroxide solution is added. Finely powdered sodium carbonate is then added in 50-g. portions until the mixture is strongly alkaline. The mixture froths considerably, but this causes no trouble unless too small a crock is used. The stirrer is loosened and the crock is removed.
The reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight and is then heated for one hour on the steam bath. It is transferred to a modified Claisen flask (p. 130), and the β-chloropropionic acid is isolated by distillation under reduced pressure, employing a water pump. Nitric acid is collected up to 100°/20 mm., using a water condenser. The condenser is replaced by a distilling flask, and the residual material is fractionated. The yield of β-chloropropionic acid boiling at 107–109°/20 mm. and freezing at 39° is 179–181 g. (78–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
C. 5,5-Dicyano-4-phenyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one 1,3-propanediol ketal. Benzylidenemalononitrile (3.85 g, 25 mmol) and cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal (5.6 g, mmol) are combined in 25 mL of dry distilled toluene in a sealed tube with a magnetic stirring bar. The reaction mixture is heated at 80°C for a 6.5 hr with stirring. The crude reaction mixture is filtered through a short plug of glass wool and applied to a Waters Associates Prep LC/System 500, eluting with 2.5 : 1 hexane/ethyl acetate. The fractions containing product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 4–4.2 g (60–64%) of 5,5-dicyano-4-phenyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one 1,3-propanediol ketal as a white solid: mp 139–141°C (ethanol,).
B. 3-Methyl-1H-indazole ( 2 ). A 2-L single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 1-(2-aminophenyl) ethanone oxime (9.76 g, 65.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and dichloromethane (1 L ). Triethylamine (18.1 mL, 130 mmol, 2.00 equiv) is added via syringe, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min at ambient temperature before being cooled to 0-5 °C in an ice/water bath. Methanesulfonyl chloride (6.00 mL, 78.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is added to 300 mL dichloromethane, and the resulting solution is cooled to 0-5 °C in an ice/water bath. The cold solution of methanesulfonyl chloride is added via cannula to the colorless oxime mixture over 30 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred at 0-5 °C for 1.5 h. Silica gel is added, and the green/brown solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature is 25 °C, 30-60 mmHg). The resulting brown solid is loaded on a flash chromatography column (2.50 in. diameter glass column and ca 410 g of silica). The product is eluted using 3.00 L of 2:3 ethyl acetate-hexanes, followed by 2.00 L of 1:1 ethyl acetate-hexanes. The fractions (50 mL size) containing the desired product are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation to afford 5.86 g (44.1 mmol, 68.2%) of 3 as a tan solid.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 760 g. (844 cc.) of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) and to this is slowly added 150 g. (0.77 mole) of α-bromocaproic acid. The flask is well stoppered and allowed to stand in a warm place (50-55°) for twenty to thirty hours. The amino acid separates and is filtered off with suction and washed with methyl alcohol. This crop of crystals weighs 51–56 g. The aqueous filtrate is evaporated nearly to dryness on a steam bath and then treated with about 250 cc. of methyl alcohol. This precipitates a second crop of amino acid contaminated with ammonium bromide. On washing with methyl alcohol and recrystallizing from water, there is obtained 10–15 g. more of pure product. The total yield is 63–68 g. (62–67 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A second portion of 80 ml. of ethanol-free ether is then added to the reaction mixture with stirring, followed by 15 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid over a period of 5 minutes. After 3 minutes' contact, the ether layer is removed as before, washed immediately with 50 ml. of fresh 10% sodium carbonate solution, and dried over 10 g. of sodium sulfate. This procedure is repeated (about 6 or 7 times) until the ether layer is no longer yellow.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 360 g. (1.5 moles) of crystalline sodium sulfide and 1.5 l. of 95 per cent alcohol. The flask is heated on a steam bath until the sulfide dissolves. Then 48 g. (1.5 atoms) of finely ground sulfur is added, and the heating is continued until the sulfur has dissolved, forming a brownish-red solution of sodium disulfide. A solution of 315 g. (2 moles) of ochloronitrobenzene in 500 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is prepared in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The sodium disulfide solution is added slowly to this solution through a funnel placed in the top of the reflux condenser. The addition should be slow until the violence of the reaction abates somewhat.
The solution is cooled to room temperature, saturated with sodium chloride (about 170 g. is required), and extracted with ether in a continuous extractor. The extraction time is 15–20 hours. The ether extract is adjusted to a volume of 1 l., dried over 4–5 g. of sodium hydroxide pellets, and filtered, and the ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath. The residue crystallizes on cooling. The yield of dark red crystals melting at 61–63° is 39–41 g. (85–89%).
To a slurry of 33.5–33.9 g. of the pure (−)-amine (−)-DAG salt in 130 ml. of water is added 56 ml. of 2 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the resulting oily suspension is extracted with four 80-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 50 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator, the crude base is distilled under reduced pressure through a 20-cm. Vigreux column, affording 10.9–11.7 g. (85–90% yield, based on the amount of the salt used) of the pure (−)-amine as a colorless liquid, b.p. 156–157° (11 mm.), nD24 1.6211–1.6212, d424 1.056, [α]D25 −80.1° (neat), [α]D25 −60.4° (c 10.0%, methanol), [α]D25 −59.3° (c 0.65%, methanol) and.
The mother liquor and washings are returned to the flask and again boiled for seventy-two hours under reflux. The liquid is concentrated to 800 cc. and again chilled to 0°, inoculated, and allowed to stand at 0° for twenty-four hours. The second crop of glucoside so obtained is filtered by suction and washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. This yield is 110–145 g., melting at 164–165°. The mother liquor and washings are combined and concentrated to about 300 cc., chilled to 0°, and again inoculated and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The resulting mush of crystals is diluted with twice its weight of absolute methyl alcohol, and, after standing twenty-four hours at 0°, the third crop of glucoside is filtered. This is recrystallized from 2.5 parts of methyl alcohol. The yield is 30–36 g., melting at 164–165°.
D. (1S)-1-Phenylpropan-1-amine hydrochloride (5). A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar is charged with 4 (11.62 g, 92.9% purity, 32.19 mmol). A mixture of methanol (270 mL) and concentrated aqueous HCl (60.9 mL) is added to the flask. The flask is capped and the resulting clear, bright yellow solution is allowed to stir at room temperature for 16.5 h. The reaction mixture is then concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (10 mmHg) and the residue is dissolved in 1.21 M aqueous HCl (300 mL). The precipitate is removed by filtration on a sintered-glass funnel. The acidic filtrate is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 300 mL), then it is basified (pH ≥ 12, Note 24) by adding 2 M NaOH (~300 mL). The resulting milky solution is extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 300 mL). The combined extracts are dried over Na2SO4 (160 g) and filtered. A solution of HCl in diethyl ether (1 M, 67.6 mL, 67.6 mmol) is added to the organic layer and the mixture is concentrated at 30 °C by rotary evaporation (200–250 mmHg), then at 50–100 mmHg. The resulting off-white to yellow solid (5.60 g) is triturated with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and filtered to afford 4.89 g (88% yield, 97% ee) of the pure title compound as a white solid.
D. 2-Methyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one. A dry, 500 mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet, and a thermometer is charged with 84 g (0.72 mol) of 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentan-3-one and 74 g (0.36 mol) of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide. The mixture is heated at 100°C for 12 hr with stirring and then cooled to room temperature, at which point the mixture becomes a semisolid as the acetamide crystallizes. The semisolid mixture is diluted with 50 mL of water and stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After the stirring is stopped, 200 mL of hexane is added and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 mL of hexane. The combined hexane extracts are washed with four 100-mL portions of water and then dried over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr. After removal of the drying agent by filtration through a coarse sintered-glass funnel, the hexane is evaporated with a rotary evaporator (25°C water bath) at aspirator pressure. The crude, pale-yellow oil is distilled to afford 105–112 g (75–80%) of 2-methyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)pentan-3-one, bp 71–75°C (15 mm), as a colorless liquid.
C. Diethyl dioxosuccinate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with dihydroxytartaric acid disodium salt hydrate (100 g, 0.44 mol,) and absolute ethanol (750 mL,). The suspension is cooled to 0°C with an ice bath and anhydrous hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled into the reaction mixture with stirring (0°C, ca. 30 min). The reaction mixture is stoppered and placed in the refrigerator for 72 hr. The mixture is filtered using a Büchner funnel and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude diethyl dioxosuccinate is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 39.60 g (44%) of pure diethyl dioxosuccinate is, bp 109–116°C (6–8 mm); lit.4 bp 109–114°C (6 mm).
A. 2,2-Dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser (the top of which is connected to a calcium chloride drying tube) are placed 50.4 g (0.4 mol) of 2-methylcyclohexane-1,3-dione2 and 500 mL of dry methanol. To this stirred solution is added dropwise 168 mL of commercial Triton B (40% in methanol) and. After the additional is complete, the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 10 min and 60.0 g (0.423 mol) of methyl iodide is added portionwise. This solution is then stirred and heated under reflux for 16–20 hr. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, about 400 mL of methanol is removed by rotary evaporation. The residue is poured into a mixture of 100 mL (1.2 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 100 g of ice to decompose the O-alkylated product, and the mixture is stirred for 30 min. The precipitated solid (recovered starting material) is collected by filtration and the filtrate is extracted 4 times with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are washed with 5% sodium thiosulfate solution (4 × 100 mL), saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 × 100 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Ethyl acetate is removed by rotary evaporation and the residue is distilled to give 30–32 g (54–57%) of 2,2-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione bp 92–97°C (4 mm) as a glassy solid and.

The oil and ether extracts are combined, the ether is removed, and the residue distilled from a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask having a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The fraction boiling at 95–100° at 5 mm. weighs 170–190 g. and melts at 78–80°. This product is transferred to a large mortar, allowed to cool, and ground with 120 cc. of petroleum ether (b.p. 35–60°). After filtering with suction, and allowing the solvent to evaporate from the crystals, there is obtained 133–147 g. of cyclohexanone oxime (59–65 per cent of the calculated amount) melting at 86–88°.
A. Heptoic anhydride (enanthic anhydride). In a 250-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask, equipped with a stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer, are placed 15.8 g. (16.1 ml., 0.2 mole) of dry pyridine and 25 ml. of dry benzene. Then 14.8 g. (15.5 ml., 0.1 mole) of heptoyl chloride is added rapidly to the stirred solution. The temperature rises only slightly, and a pyridinium complex separates. While stirring is continued, 13.0 g. (14.1 ml., 0.1 mole) of heptoic acid is added from the dropping funnel over a period of 5 minutes. The temperature rises rapidly to 60–65°, and pyridine hydrochloride is formed. After stirring for 10 minutes, the solid is collected on a chilled Büchner funnel and washed twice with 25-ml. portions of dry benzene.
Five hundred grams of castor oil is added to a solution of 100 g. of potassium hydroxide in 1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol. The mixture is placed in a 3-l. flask equipped with a reflux condenser and is boiled for three hours. The solution is then poured into 3 l. of water and acidified by the addition of a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 cc. of water. The acid which separates is washed twice with warm water, shaken intermittently for one hour with 100 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and then filtered with suction. The yield of crude ricinoleic acid thus obtained is 480 g. The acid should be oxidized at once.
A. 1-(4-Bromophenyl)-4-methylphenyl)but-3-yn-1-ol (1). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter and two rubber septa, is charged with THF (40 mL) and 4-ethynyltoluene (4.08 mL, 32.2 mmol) via syringes. The reaction vessel is placed in a dry ice-acetone bath. After 10 min, lithium diisopropylamide solution (LDA) (16.1 mL, 32.2 mmol) is added within 5 min via syringe to the stirred reaction mixture. The mixture is allowed to stir for 10 min after which time the bath is removed and the reaction vessel is allowed to warm to room temperature. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (75 mL) is added over 5 min via syringe to the reaction vessel, followed by a solution of 4-bromostyrene oxide (4.94 g, 24.8 mmol) in 5 mL of THF over 1 min via syringe. The reaction mixture acquires a dark red wine color and is allowed to stir at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the reaction flask is placed in an ice-bath and quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (100 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel using saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (50 mL) as a rinse. The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 150 mL). The combined ether extracts are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (2 × 200 mL). The organic phase is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (10 g) and filtered through a fritted-glass funnel of medium porosity. The solvent is removed via rotary evaporation (23 °C, 25 mmHg) followed by high vacuum (23 °C, 0.6 mmHg, 3 h). The crude product is purified by recrystallization and chromatography of the mother liquor on SiO2 to yield 1 as a white crystalline solid (6.01 g, 19.1 mmol, 77%).

A 350-mL, round-bottomed pressure flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, rubber septum, and argon inlet needle is charged with (Ph3P)4Pd (3.46 g, 2.99 mmol, 0.03 equiv) and 150 mL of toluene, and then vinylidene chloride (11.98 mL, 14.54 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added via syringe over 2 min. The resulting yellow mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min and then a mixture of 1-octyne (14.75 mL, 11.02 g, 100.0 mmol) and n-butylamine (14.82 mL, 10.97 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is transferred into the reaction mixture via cannula over 5 min from a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a septum and an argon inlet needle. The flask is rinsed with two 3-mL portions of toluene, which are transferred into the pressure flask by cannula. The septum is temporarily removed from the pressure flask and copper(I) iodide (0.571 g, 2.99 mmol, 0.03 equiv) is added in one portion. Material adhering to the sides of the pressure flask is rinsed into the reaction mixture with 5 mL of toluene. The pressure flask is then sealed under argon with a threaded Teflon cap and submerged in a preheated oil bath at 40 °C behind a safety shield. The color of the clear yellow solution darkens to red over 4 h. After 8 h, the cloudy red mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and then filtered through a medium frit sintered glass funnel to remove the precipitated ammonium salt. The solid is washed with 100 mL of hexanes, and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 20 mmHg). The resulting red oil (28.0 g) is diluted with 20 mL of CH2Cl2 and concentrated onto 40 g of silica gel (40 °C, 16 mmHg, Note11). The clumpy powder is transferred to a column (25 × 8 cm) of 600 g of silica gel and is eluted with hexanes. After elution with 1000 mL of hexanes, 50-mL fractions are collected. Fractions 6 to 20 are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford 12.80–12.97 g (75–76%) of the desired enyne as a yellow liquid.
A. Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)tellurium dichloride. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 27.0 g. (0. 100 mole) of tellurium tetrachloride and 64.8 g. (0.600 mole) of dry anisole. The mixture is heated to 160° over a period of 30 minutes and maintained at this temperature for 6 hours. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the solvent is removed with the aid of a vacuum pump. The crude solid is dissolved in ca. 250 ml. of boiling acetonitrile and filtered while hot. Upon cooling to −25°, crystals deposit, which weigh 35.5–38.5 g. (84–90%), m.p. 182–183°.
In a 3-l. three-necked flask a mixture of 182 g. (1.2 moles) of vanillin and 450 cc. of boiling water is heated on a steam bath. A solution of sodium hydroxide is prepared by dissolving 150 g. of u.s.p. sodium hydroxide in 200–300 cc. of water and diluting to 750 cc. A 360-cc. portion of this solution is heated to about 100° and added in one lot to the hot mixture of vanillin and water. The flask is now fitted with a reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, and 250-cc. separatory funnel.
A. 2,3-Dichlorotetrahydropyran. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a glass-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask, a low-temperature thermometer, an exit tube attached to a calcium chloride drying tube, and a Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with a solution of 118 g. (1.40 moles) of dihydropyran in 400 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. While the solution is stirred continuously it is cooled to −30° with an acetone–dry ice bath. Anhydrous chlorine is passed through the solution and introduced at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction solution does not rise above −10°. Completion of the addition process (ca. 1 hour) is indicated by a rapid development of a yellow color (excess chlorine) in the reaction solution and a distinct decrease in the temperature of the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, several drops of dihydropyran are added to discharge the yellow color, and the colorless solution is stored at −30° until it is used in the next step.
A. t-Butyl phenyl carbonate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with thermometer, dropping funnel, and mechanical stirrer are placed 248 g. (3.35 moles) of t-butyl alcohol, 430 g. (3.33 moles) of quinoline, and 500 ml. of methylene dichloride. The solution is stirred while 520 g. (3.32 moles) of phenyl chloroformate is added dropwise over a period of 4 hours. During the addition the temperature is maintained at 28–31° by cooling the flask, as needed, by a stream of tap water. The solution is allowed to stand overnight and is then treated with 800 ml. of water to dissolve the precipitated quinoline hydrochloride. The mixture is shaken well in a separatory funnel; the organic layer is separated and washed with two 200-ml. portions of water and three or four 200-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid. After the extract has dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 5 hours, the solvent is removed by distillation, a water aspirator being used to remove the last portions of the methylene dichloride. Distillation of the residue from a 1-l. Claisen flask by means of an air bath maintained at 125–135° gives 460–495 g. (71–76%) of a colorless oil, b.p. 74–78° (0.5 mm.), n24D 1.4832. This product is sufficiently pure for use in the preparation below.
B. Dimethyl 2,3-pentadienedioate. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a gas-inlet adapter, a 50-ml. addition funnel, a ground-glass stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 27.0 g. (0.145 mole) of the diester from Part A and 100 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (freshly distilled from sodium). The flask is flushed with nitrogen (or argon), and a positive pressure is maintained while the contents are cooled to 0° in an ice–salt bath and stirred with an efficient motor. Triethylamine (22 ml., 0.16 mole, freshly distilled from calcium hydride) is added through the addition funnel over a 10-minute period, the gas-inlet adapter is replaced with a calcium chloride tube, and the mixture is stirred at 0–5° for 18 hours. The precipitate is removed by vacuum filtration and washed with three 100-ml. portions of anhydrous diethyl ether. The combined filtrate and washings are washed successively with three 75-ml. portions of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual oil is distilled, yielding 13.3–13.9 g. (61–64%) of dimethyl 2,3-pentadienedioate3, b.p. 58° (0.02 mm.).
After the evaporation of most of the liquid, the nicotinic acid nitrate from two runs is transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker, 400 cc. of distilled water is added, and the mixture is heated until complete solution results. On cooling, the nicotinic acid nitrate separates as yellow granular crystals and is filtered off. To obtain it absolutely pure, it may be recrystallized in a way similar to that just described but with the use of animal charcoal. It contains one molecule of water of crystallization and has a melting point of 190–192° (corr.). The yield is 420–460 g. 83–91 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 2-l. flask are placed 375 g. (1.3 moles) of commercial sodium dichromate, 225 cc. of water, and 300 g. (2.3 moles) of glycerol α,γ-dichlorohydrin (p. 292) (b.p. 68–75°/14 mm.). The flask is set in a water bath and equipped with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer. The contents are vigorously stirred, and 450 g. (245 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, diluted with 115 g. of water, are introduced during the course of seven to eight hours. It is convenient to add the acid at ten-minute intervals. The temperature is kept between 20° and 25° during the entire reaction; this is accomplished by adding a little ice to the water bath from time to time. The stirring is continued for sixteen to seventeen hours after all the acid has been added; as there is very little heat evolved during this part of the reaction, the water bath may be allowed to come to room temperature.
B. GlcNAc-thiazoline triacetate. A 1000-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere immersed in an oil bath is fitted with Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (41 × 19 mm), a rubber septum and a reflux condenser capped with a septum, through which nitrogen is affixed by use of a needle. The septum on the flask is temporarily removed, a funnel inserted and the vessel is charged with 300 mL of isopropyl acetate and 18.3 g (40 mmol) of phosphorus pentasulfide (P4S10). The resulting suspension is stirred rapidly while 76.3 mL (360 mmol) of hexamethyldisiloxane is added via syringe over a 5-min period. The mixture is heated at reflux for 10 min while vigorous stirring is maintained. The solution is allowed to cool to just below reflux, the septum on the flask is replaced with a funnel and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranose (40.0 g, 103 mmol) is added in four portions with continuous stirring over a 5-min period. The septum is replaced and the reaction mixture is then brought back to reflux, and held at that temperature for 2–3 h, during which period it becomes homogeneous and orange. TLC analysis (3:1, dichloromethane / ethyl acetate) indicates complete conversion to product (Rf = 0.40 on silica).
The Vigreux column, dropping funnel, and distilling head are then replaced by a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with 100 ml. of methanol. With the top of the funnel left open to the atmosphere, the methanol is added slowly to the oily flask contents. After vigorous boiling has ceased, the solution is heated under reflux for one hour, cooled in an ice bath, then treated slowly with a solution of 56 g. (1.0 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 25 ml. of water and 50 ml. of methanol.2 The resulting mixture is heated under reflux for 19 hours, dissolved in 600 ml. of water, and extracted three times with 100 ml. of ether. The extracts are combined, washed once with 50 ml. of 5 N hydrochloric acid, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Ether is removed by distillation as described above, using a 300-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a 50-ml., round-bottomed distilling flask, and a 100-mm. Vigreux column. Vacuum distillation of the remaining liquid gives 12.5–13.4 g. (74–80%) of 2-methylbiphenyl, b.p. 76–78° (0.5 mm.), n20D 1.5920 and.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 400 ml. of 0.2N nitric acid (5 ml. of concentrated nitric acid, sp. gr. 1.42, and 395 ml. of water) and 168.3 g. (2 moles) of dihydropyran. The mixture is heated on a steam bath or a boiling water bath; the yellowish upper layer dissolves suddenly after 25 to 45 minutes of heating. The flask is swirled to aid the dissolution at this time, and the period of heating is extended for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.
D. 3-Methyl-2-buten-1-yl diazoacetate. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a stoppered, pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with a solution of 30.5 g (0.179 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl acetoacetate and 23.3 g (0.231 mol) of triethylamine> in 150 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile. A solution of 55.85 g (0.233 mol) of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide in 150 mL of acetonitrile is added dropwise over 30 min with continuous magnetic stirring. A white precipitate of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonamide is observed after ~30 min (additional acetonitrile is added if necessary to facilitate stirring). The resulting heterogeneous yellow mixture is maintained at room temperature for an additional 2.5–3 hr. A solution of 24.6 g (0.586 mol) of lithium hydroxide (LiOH·H2O) in 200 mL of water is added to the reaction mixture (the precipitate dissolves), and the resulting light brown mixture is stirred for 8 hr. The reaction mixture is extracted with two 50-mL portions of 2:1 ether:ethyl acetate. The combined organic phases are washed with one 25-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resulting orange liquid, containing some solid sulfonamide, is purified by flash column chromatography on silica (200 g) with 1:10 ethyl acetate:hexane as the eluent. Collection of the yellow band and concentration under reduced pressure affords 22.39 g (81% yield) of 3-methyl-2-butenyl diazoacetate as a yellow oil.
The cold distillate is filtered with suction, and the white crystalline solid is sucked thoroughly dry on the filter. The crystals are dried further in a vacuum desiccator (at about 1 mm.) at room temperature or below for about 12 hours. The melting point of the 2-indanone is 57–58°. The yield is 90–107 g. (69–81%).
To the reaction flask containing the crude trimethylethylene dibromide is added 540 cc. of water, and the flask is fitted with a long reflux condenser and a mercury-sealed stirrer. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for three to five hours until hydrolysis is practically complete. The reflux condenser is then replaced by a condenser for distillation, and the crude methyl isopropyl ketone is removed from the reaction mixture by direct distillation, with stirring, until the temperature rises and the oil nearly stops coming over (about one and one-half hours), or until the oil coming over is heavier than water. The residue in the flask can be distilled to yield about 380 cc. of constant-boiling hydrobromic acid.
A. Binor-S.2 A 2-l., three-necked flask equipped with Teflon sleeves, a thermometer, a condenser, a dropping funnel, and a mechanical stirrer is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 200 g. (2.18 moles) of freshly distilled norbornadiene, 400 ml. of dry toluene, and 7.8 g. of cobalt bromide–triphenylphosphine catalyst. While stirring at room temperature, 2.1 ml. of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate co-catalyst is added dropwise. The mixture is heated slowly to 105°, and the heating mantle is lowered. The ensuing exothermic reaction maintains the temperature at 105–110° for 15 minutes. When the temperature begins to fall, the mantle is raised, the mixture is brought to the reflux temperature, and stirring and refluxing are continued for 12 hours. The cooled mixture is diluted with 650 ml. of dichloromethane, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with three 650-ml. portions of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvents are evaporated at reduced pressure. The residual crude material, 185–203 g., is distilled at 106–107° (1.5 mm.), giving 165–170 g. (82–85%) of Binor-S, which solidifies on cooling to a white solid, m.p. 59–63°.
A. 2-Hydroxybutanenitrile. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer and charged with 312 g (3.0 mol) of sodium bisulfite and 1050 mL of water. The stirrer is started and after the sodium bisulfite has dissolved, the flask is placed in an ice–salt bath. A solution of 147 g (3.0 mol) of sodium cyanide in 450 mL of water and 174 g (3.0 mol) of propanal are separately cooled to 0°C in ice–salt baths. When the temperature of the vigorously stirring sodium bisulfite solution has stabilized at 0°C the cold propanal is added in one portion. The temperature of the reaction solution immediately increases to ca. 35°C and then returns to ca. 0°C. After 30 min the cold sodium cyanide solution is added in one portion. The reaction mixture again warms to ca. 15°C and then returns to ca. 0°C. This mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 0°C, during which time a thick white precipitate of sodium sulfite forms. The supernatant liquid is decanted into a 4-L separatory funnel and the precipitate is washed with 1 L of ice–water. The combined aqueous solution is extracted with three 1-L portions of ethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 1 L of saturated brine and dried by stirring (magnetic stirring bar) over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr. The solution is filtered through a coarse, sintered-glass funnel and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure. After the pH of the residue is adjusted to 5 with a few drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid, the residue is distilled to give 154–192 g (60–75%) of 2-hydroxybutanenitrile, bp 108–114°C (30 mm), as a colorless liquid.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a cork bearing a thermometer and a large bent glass tube, is placed 6 l. of 32 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.163). The acid is heated to 50°, and 1 kg. (2.9 moles) of powdered sugar is dissolved in the liquid with shaking. The dark-colored solution is heated rapidly to 70–72°, kept at this temperature for ten minutes, and poured at once onto 3 kg. of cracked ice in a large earthenware crock (preferably in a hood). When the mixture has cooled to room temperature, 600 g. (2.67 moles) of commercial stannous chloride crystals (SnCl2·2H2O) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred thoroughly for ten minutes and then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours.
The ice-cold solution of fluoboric acid is then poured into the diazonium solution, which has been cooled below 0°. The temperature should remain under 10° during the addition, which is carried out fairly rapidly. Powerful stirring is required to agitate the thick magma at this stage. After twenty to thirty minutes' stirring, the brown-colored mass is filtered with suction, using two 24-cm. Büchner funnels. The yellowish crystalline solid is washed with about 800 cc. of iced water, with the same volume of methyl alcohol, and with about 900 cc. of commercial ethyl ether. The solid should be sucked as free as possible from liquid after each washing. This washing is important, since it improves the stability of the product.
The yield of crude product is 199–216 g. (75–81 per cent of the theoretical amount). The material may be recrystallized by dissolving it in 1 l. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. Upon cooling, crystals which melt at 106–107° separate. The yield of recrystallized product is 190–210 g.
When the mixture has cooled to about 60°, there are added from the separatory funnel, first, a solution of 114 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl laurate in 150 cc. of absolute alcohol, then 500 cc. more of alcohol, as rapidly as is possible without loss of material through the condenser. The time required for the addition of the ester solution and the alcohol is less than five minutes, usually two or three minutes. When the reaction has subsided, the flask is heated on a steam bath until the sodium is completely dissolved. The mixture is then steam-distilled to remove the toluene and ethyl alcohol. The contents of the flask are transferred to a separatory funnel while still hot and washed three times with 200-cc. portions of hot water to remove the sodium laurate. The lauryl alcohol is extracted with ether from the cooled mixture and the washings. The combined ether extracts are washed with water, sodium carbonate solution, and again with water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is evaporated and the lauryl alcohol distilled under diminished pressure. The yield is 60–70 g. (65–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product boiling at 143–146°/18 mm. or 198–200°/135 mm..
A. Bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-1-ol (1). To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum, is added at room temperature a mixture of 2.0 g (15.6 mmol) of methyl 5-hexenoate, 11.2 mL (11.2 mmol) of a 1M solution of chlorotitanium triisopropoxide in hexane, and 54 mL of anhydrous ether under a nitrogen atmosphere. A 1M solution of n-butylmagnesium chloride in ether (52 mL, 52 mmol;) is added over a period of 6.5 hr via a syringe pump at room temperature. After the addition is complete, the resulting black reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min. The mixture is cooled to 0°C with an ice bath, diluted with 50 mL of ether and then quenched by slow addition of water (14 mL). The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hr at room temperature. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (2 × 50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Purification of the crude product by column chromatography on 40 g of silica gel using a gradient of 5% to 10% ether/pentane as the eluent provides 1.09 g (71%) of bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-1-ol (1)2 as a colorless oil.
B. 4-Chloro-4-hexenyl trifluoroacetate. A 500-ml., one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 200 ml. of redistilled trifluoroacetic acid and 6-chloro-2-hexyne (0.16 mole, calculated from GC analysis) containing 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. The flask is fitted with a Friedrichs condenser, and the mixture is refluxed for 3 hours. The flask is transferred to a vacuum distillation apparatus; with the aid of an aspirator and a controlled leak, excess trifluoroacetic acid is removed under slightly reduced pressure, maintaining the pot temperature below 65° to prevent reactions of the acid with the double bond. The remaining trifluoroacetic acid is removed by pouring the product into 100 ml. of ice water and extracting with 100- and 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic extracts are brought to pH 7 with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (ca. 40 ml.). The resulting aqueous layer is extracted once with an additional 25 ml. of dichloromethane, and the combined dichloromethane extracts are dried in three stages by stirring over magnesium sulfate. The final stage is allowed to stand in a refrigerator for 24 hours. The solvent is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Widmer column ((Note 8)) at atmospheric pressure. Distillation at reduced pressure gives 16.0–16.4 g. of 4-chloro-4-hexenyl trifluoroacetate, b.p. 86–89° (22 mm.), which contains trace amounts of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane. On the basis of the alkyne present in the reactant the yield is 50–52%.
B. (+)-Isopinocampheol. To the stirred solution of (+)-diisopinocampheylborane in tetrahydrofuran, prepared above, 50 mL of distilled water is slowly added dropwise via syringe [CAUTION!] followed by the slow addition of 16.41 g (0.107 mol) of solid sodium perborate tetrahydrate through an appropriate addition funnel at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 35°C. Stirring is continued at room temperature (22°C) for 2 hr to ensure completion of the oxidation reaction. The contents of the flask are then poured into 70 mL of ice-cold water in a separatory funnel. After thorough mixing, the organic layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 25 mL of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 20-mL portions of water and then with 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is purified by short-path vacuum distillation to give 14.1–14.3 g (91–92%) of isopinocampheol, bp 68°C (0.7 mm), as white needles (mp 53–55°C) that crystallize in the receiving flask. Recrystallization from pentane gives pure isopinocampheol as needles, mp 54–55°C (uncorrec.), [α]25D 34.4° (benzene, c 10) indicating 96.4% enantiomeric purity based on the highest reported literature value of 35.7°.3
A 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 200 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide and 26.0 g. (0.399 mole) of potassium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes before 11.7 g. (0.100 mole) of indole is added. Stirring is continued for 45 minutes before 34.2 g. (0.200 mole) of benzyl bromide is added. After being stirred for an additional 45 minutes the mixture is diluted with 200 ml. of water. The mixture is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and each ether layer is washed with three 50-ml. portions of water. The combined ether layers are dried over calcium chloride, and the solvent is removed at slightly reduced pressure. The excess benzyl bromide is removed by distillation at approximately 15 mm., and the residue is distilled, yielding 17.5–18.4 g. (85–89%) of 1-benzylindole, b.p. 133–138° (0.3 mm.). The distillate crystallizes upon cooling and scratching; recrystallization from ethanol gives material melting at 42–43° and.
A 3-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. The flask is contained in a pneumatic trough through which water at room temperature is circulated. A mixture of 30 ml. of ethyl cyanoacetate and 100 ml. of ethanol is placed in the flask. Meanwhile 54 g. (0.5 mole) of p-benzoquinone in a 1-l. flask is heated to 40° with 500 ml. of 95% ethanol, and, when practically all the quinone is dissolved, 56 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate is added and the mixture is stirred until solution is complete. Most of this solution is placed in the 500-ml. dropping funnel, the remainder being added when the funnel becomes sufficiently emptied after the reaction has started.
B. Diethyl mercaptoacetal. A 12-l. three-necked flask, equipped with an efficient Hershberg stirrer, a Dry Ice condenser, and a stopper, is placed in an enameled container. The flask is charged with 500 g. (1.38 moles, calculated as tetrasulfide) of 1,1,1',1'-tetraethoxyethyl polysulfide and 500 ml. of anhydrous ether. The condenser is filled with acetone and Dry Ice, and the contents of the flask are cooled by means of acetone and Dry Ice kept at −35° to −45°. Liquid ammonia is introduced into the stirred solution until 4.5–5.0 l. has been added. The solution is stirred for several minutes to ensure homogeneity, and 200 g. (8.7 g. atoms) of sodium is added in 2- to 5-g. lumps to the mixture over a period of 30–45 minutes. The last 2–10 g. of sodium causes the solution to turn deep blue. The mixture is stirred for 30 additional minutes, and ammonium chloride (about 200 g.) is cautiously added with stirring until the blue color is discharged. The cooling bath is removed and replaced by a bath of hot water into which steam may be introduced. The mixture is stirred while the ammonia is removed by distillation or evaporation (the distillation should be continued until the residue can no longer be stirred or is difficult to stir). The soft, semisolid mass containing small amounts of ammonia is cooled in ice, and 1 l. of ice-cold water is added with stirring. When most of the solid has dissolved, ice-cold hydrochloric acid is added cautiously, with frequent checks of the pH, until a pH of 8.0–8.5 is reached. The pH is then adjusted to 7.8–8.0 (preferably by a pH meter) by passing carbon dioxide into the cold solution. The oil is separated from the aqueous layer, which is extracted with two 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and two 100-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride, and are dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled from a 500-ml. flask using a small Vigreux column or a Claisen head. The product weighs 320–372 g. (77–90% yield, based on polysulfide; 71–83% yield, based on bromoacetal), boils at 62–64°/12 mm., and has n25D 1.4391–1.4400. The residue, 23–27 g., n25D 1.4702–1.4730, consists mainly of 1,1,1',1'-tetraethoxyethyl sulfide.
C. 1-Phenyl-3,4-dihydro-6,7-methylenedioxyisoquinoline. The reaction mixture containing the aryllithium intermediate is stirred for 15 min (internal temperature −65 to −68°C), and then 4.3 mL (42 mmol) of distilled benzonitrile is added quickly. The mixture is allowed to warm gradually to room temperature and the stirring is continued overnight. The yellow solution is diluted with 25 mL of ether, the mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, and the reaction flask is rinsed with an additional 75 mL of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 150 mL of water and then extracted with three 75-mL portions of 10% (w / w) hydrochloric acid. The combined acid extracts are rendered basic by the addition of 100 mL of 20% (w / w) aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting milky white mixture is extracted with three 75-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation, to give 8.96 g (94% crude yield) of orange-tan solid. This material is purified by recrystallization from ethyl acetate : acetone 2 : 1 (v : v) to give a first crop (6.8 g), and by flash chromatography3 of the residue from the mother liquor, using 150 g of 230–400-mesh silica gel (Merck), a 40-mm diameter column, and elution with 10 : l (v : v) ethyl acetate : methanol. A fast-moving orange band and a slower moving lemon–yellow band can be seen clearly on the column. The lemon-yellow band is collected from the column and evaporation gives a second crop (1.4 g) of comparably pure material. The total yield of the pale-yellow isoquinoline is 8.2 g (86%), mp 135–137°C.
A 2-l. beaker placed on a piece of board in the bottom of a 4-l. (1-gallon) crock is fitted with a mechanical stirrer. In the beaker are placed 650 cc. of commercial sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) and 500 g. (3.4 moles) of technical phthalic anhydride. The mixture is stirred, and steam is passed into the crock. When the mixture reaches 80°, the steam is shut off and 210 cc. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.51) is added slowly from a separatory funnel at such a rate as to maintain the temperature of the stirred mixture at 100–110°. The addition requires one to two hours. After the fuming acid has been added, 900 cc. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is added as rapidly as possible without causing the temperature to rise above 110°. The mixture is then stirred and heated by passage of steam into the crock for two hours longer.
A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by the cautious addition of 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of clean sodium to 600 cc. of anhydrous ethyl alcohol in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a mercury-sealed stirrer, and a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube. The flask is then immersed in an ice-salt bath and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the solution has reached 10° an ice-cold solution of 196 g. (2 moles) of cyclohexanone in 292 g. (2 moles) of ethyl oxalate is added from the dropping funnel over a period of about fifteen minutes. Vigorous stirring is required to prevent complete solidification of the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, the ice bath is retained for an hour, and then the mixture is stirred at room temperature for about six hours.
A. Isopropylideneacetophenone. A 1-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a condenser equipped with a two-way stopcock leading to a balloon of argon gas. To the flask is added a solution of 18.4 g of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-1-butanone in 60 mL of dry methylene chloride. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and 28.5 g of triethylamine, a catalytic amount of 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, and 20 mL of methylene chloride are added. A solution of 25.8 g of trifluoroacetic anhydride in 40 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise over a period of 15 min, and the mixture is stirred for 2.5 hr.
C. Recrystallization of (R)-(+)-1,1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diol. A 200-mL flask with a reflux condenser is charged with 11.4 g of crude (R)-(+)-1,1'-binaphthalene-2,2'-diol and 1.5 g of Norit A, and refluxed for 5 min. The hot solution is filtered through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit. The Celite and Norit A from the frit are slurried together with 1.5 g of Norit A in 70 mL of toluene, refluxed for 5 min, and filtered hot through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit. The Celite is washed with 70 mL of hot toluene. The combined filtrates are warmed to 50°C to dissolve the precipitated crystals and filtered once again while warm through a pad of 5 g of Celite on a glass frit, which is then washed with 40 mL of hot toluene. The filtrate is freed from solvent on a rotary evaporator and the residue is recrystallized from 75 mL of toluene with stirring. The mixture is stirred overnight at ambient temperature. The resulting suspension is filtered and the filter cake is washed with two 10-mL portions of toluene. The recrystallized product is then dried under reduced pressure (high vacuum) to give 9.62 g of white, microcrystalline material in the first crop. This material melts at 207–209°C, [α]D25 +33.6° (THF, c 1.11) and.
A. trans-7,8-Diacetoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene. A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, an efficient stirrer, and a thermometer dipping well into the solution is charged with a suspension of mercury(II) acetate (160 g., 0.502 mole) in glacial acetic acid (400 ml). While the suspension is stirred, 52.0 g. of cycloöctatetraene (0.500 mole) is added rapidly. The white addition compound that separates after 10–15 minutes is decomposed by careful heating of the reaction mixture at 70–75° for 2 hours. While still warm, the mixture is poured through funnels containing glass wool plugs into two, 4-l. beakers, each containing 2 l. of water. The mixture is allowed to stand for several hours, and the solid that separates is collected on a Büchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible on the funnel. The moist, yellow solid is spread out on a large piece of filter paper and allowed to dry overnight, yielding 83–86 g. (75–77.5%) of trans-7,8-diacetoxybicyclo[4.2.0]octa-2,4-diene, m.p. 52–55°; it may be used in the next step without further purification.
B. Di-tert-butyl malonate. A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer, a mercury- or rubber sleeve-sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride guard tube, and a dropping funnel (either pressure-equalized or protected by a calcium chloride guard tube). A mixture of 100 ml. (about 1 mole) of tert-butyl alcohol, dried by distillation from sodium (p. 134, Note 2), and 80 ml. (0.63 mole) of dry dimethylaniline is placed in the flask, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 28.0 g. (0.2 mole) of malonyl dichloride in about 60 ml. of dry, alcohol-free chloroform is added slowly from the dropping funnel while the reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath. The reaction is strongly exothermic, and the rate of dropping is regulated so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 30°. After the addition is complete (about 30 minutes) the light-greenish mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours. The mixture is then cooled, 150 ml. of ice-cold 6N sulfuric acid is added with stirring, and the product is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with 6N sulfuric acid, twice with water, twice with 10% potassium carbonate, and once with saturated sodium chloride, and are finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate to which a small amount of potassium carbonate is added. The ether is removed by distillation at reduced pressure (water aspirator), and the residue (to which a pinch of magnesium oxide is added) is distilled at reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask. The yield of colorless di-tert-butyl malonate, distilling at 65–67°/1 mm., 110–111°/22 mm., is 35.8–36.2 g. (83–84%), nD25 1.4159, m.p. about −6°.
An alcoholic solution of sodium hydrosulfide is prepared by dissolving 4.6 g. (0.2 gram atom) of sodium in 150 cc. of absolute alcohol and saturating the solution with dry hydrogen sulfide.
In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer, and surrounded by an ice-salt mixture, is placed 700 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The stirrer is started, and when the acid is cooled to −3° or below, 200 g. (1.62 moles) of dry, powdered urea nitrate is added in small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0°. The addition will require about one-half hour. Stirring is continued for another one-half hour, the temperature being kept below + 3°. Then the mixture is poured upon 1 kg. of ice.
The yellow residue is loaded neat onto a pad of silica gel (15 cm × 6 cm) that has already been wetted with n-pentane, and the flask is rinsed with pentane (2 × 10 mL). The pad is rinsed with 1000 mL of n-pentane and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction. Rotary evaporation under reduced pressure (40 °C, 760 mmHg to 15 mmHg) for 2 h gives 6.47 g (58%) of (E)-2-methyltetradeca-1,3-diene as a colorless oil. The E/Z ratio of this product is determined to be 97:3.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a side arm through which a capillary tube is inserted are placed 108 g. (1.1 moles) of cyclohexanone, 85 g. (1.0 mole) of cyanoacetic acid, 3.0 g. (0.04 mole) of ammonium acetate, and 75 ml. of benzene. The flask is attached to a modified Dean and Stark constant water separator,2,3 which in turn is attached to an efficient reflux condenser. The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 160–165° so that a vigorous reflux is maintained, and the water that collects in the separator is removed at intervals. The theoretical amount of water (18 ml.) is collected in the course of 2 hours, and the mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 1 hour. At this point, Part A is followed for the isolation of cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid, or Part B for the preparation of 1-cyclohexenylacetonitrile.
A 600-ml. steel reaction vessel is precooled before loading by filling it between one-fourth and one-half full of methanol and Dry Ice. After removal of the methanol and Dry Ice, the autoclave is charged with 120 g. (176 ml., 1.76 moles) of isoprene, 113 g. (80 ml., 1.76 moles) of liquid sulfur dioxide, 88 ml. of methanol, and 4 g. of hydroquinone. The vessel is sealed, heated slowly to 85°, and maintained at that temperature for 4 hours. It is then cooled, the sulfone removed, the bomb rinsed with methanol, and the combined product and washings are treated hot with 5 g. of Norite. The filtered solution is concentrated to a volume of 250–300 ml., and the sulfone is allowed to crystallize. The material is filtered and washed with 50 ml. of cold methanol. Recrystallization from methanol (20 ml. per 25 g. of sulfone) yields 140–150 g. of thick, colorless plates. Concentration of the mother liquors raises the total yield to 182–191 g. (78–82%), melting at 63.5–64°.
A. (R)-(−)-Methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask is charged with 50 g (0.58 mol) of poly-[(R)-3-hydroxybutyric acid] (PHB) and 500 mL of absolute 1,2-dichloroethane. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr. A solution of 10 mL of concd sulfuric acid in 200 mL of absolute methanol is added and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 3 days. During this time the mixture becomes homogeneous.
To 1035 g. of sirupy arsenic acid (80–85 per cent, sp. gr. 2.00/20°; in a 12-inch evaporating dish, is added 828 g. (800 cc.) of aniline in 100-cc. portions; meanwhile the lumps of aniline arsenate which are formed are broken up by rapid stirring with a porcelain spatula. When all the aniline has been added, the powdered solid is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the lower part of the vessel, and a condenser arranged for downward distillation; an additional 800 cc. of aniline is added and the flask heated on an oil bath at 155–160° with stirring for four and one-half hours. The mass will have assumed an intense violet color.

(0.0265 mole) of cholest-4-en-3-one, 5.53 g. (0.0297 mole) of p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide, and 17 ml. of 95% ethanol. The solution is stirred and heated at reflux for 10 minutes and allowed to cool to room temperature. The precipitated solid is collected by filtration and recrystallized from 95% ethanol, affording 13.1–13.3 g (89–91%) of cholest-4-en-3-one p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone, m.p. 139–141°, in two crops.
The colorless to pale yellow filtrate is transferred to a distilling flask, the solvent is evaporated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. After a small forerun (0.5–1.0 g.), 18 g. (78%) of the product is obtained at 82–86° (10 mm.) as a colorless liquid, n25D 1.4331.
The furnace is heated to 590°, and after the air has been displaced 200 g. (216 ml., 2 moles) of ethyl acrylate is placed in the separatory funnel and admitted to the reaction tube at a rate of about 90 drops a minute, so that the addition requires about 2 hours. At the end of the addition the contents of the receiver and the small amount of liquid in the traps are combined. The total weight of crude acrylic acid containing some ethyl acrylate is 126–136 g.
The diazonium solution is added to the hot cuprous chloride solution while the latter is shaken by hand but is not cooled. After the solutions are thoroughly mixed, 840 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is steam-distilled to separate the m-chlorobenzaldehyde, which is collected practically completely in the first 1.5 l. of distillate. The m-chlorobenzaldehyde is removed from the aqueous distillate by extraction with two 150-cc. portions of ether, and the ethereal solution is dried with 10–15 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. After being decanted from the drying agent, the ether is distilled, and the residual liquid is distilled under diminished pressure. The m-chlorobenzaldehyde boils at 84–86°/8 mm., 107–109°/26 mm.. The yield is 70–74 g. (75–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
are placed 3 l. of anhydrous ether and 1290 g. (943 cc., 10 moles) of glycerol α,γ-dichlorohydrin (p. 292). The flask is surrounded by a cold-water bath, and 440 g. (11 moles) of finely powdered sodium hydroxide, which has been passed through a 20-mesh sieve, is added through the hopper in small portions, with continual stirring, while the temperature is kept at 25–30°. The addition requires about twenty minutes. The cold water is replaced by water at 40–45°, and the mixture boiled gently with stirring for four hours. It is necessary to cool the vessel at least once every hour during this period and break up with a rod or wire any lumps which cling to the side of the flask and are not incorporated by the stirrer.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stopper, a reflux condenser, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel are placed 1.5 kg. (22.9 g. atoms) of amalgamated zinc and 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The flask is heated to cause gentle refluxing to occur. A solution of 152 g. (1.0 mole) of vanillin in 450 ml. of 95% ethanol and 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added dropwise through the dropping funnel over an 8-hour period. After the addition of the vanillin is complete the mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes more. The liquid, consisting of two layers, is decanted from the zinc into a 4-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and washed three times with 200-ml. portions of benzene, and the benzene extracts are combined with the crude creosol separated initially. The residual amalgamated zinc is washed twice with 100-ml. portions of benzene, and this benzene solution is added to the combined extracts. The extracts are washed twice with 200-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and the resultant precipitate of metallic salts is removed by filtration. The solution is washed once with 200 ml. of water.
A. Copper(I) chloride–tetramethylethylenediamine complex. A 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, nitrogen inlet tube, and bubbler is charged with acetone (90 mL) and copper(I) chloride (5 g, 51 mmol). After the flask is purged with nitrogen, the mixture is stirred and N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA) (2.5 mL, 16.6 mmol) is added. Stirring is maintained for 30 min, and the solid material is then allowed to settle, leaving a clear deep-blue-green solution of the CuCl–TMEDA catalyst that is used in the oxidative coupling reaction.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an inlet tube, is placed 200 g. (253 cc.) of absolute alcohol. The flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and the alcohol is saturated with dry hydrogen chloride at 0°. The stem of a 200-cc. separatory funnel is fitted to a one-holed stopper inside a large short-stemmed funnel (Fig. 6). The space between the funnels is filled with finely cracked ice and water. In the separatory funnel is placed 112 g. (2 moles) of cold acrolein (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 15).
B. (S)-2-tert-Butyl-1-carbomethoxy-2,3-dihydro-4(1H)-pyrimidinone, 3. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two electrodes, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with a solution of 60.0 g of heterocycle 1 (0.232 mol) in 620 mL of methanol and 3.2 mL (2.34 g, 23.2 mmol) of triethylamine. The temperature is maintained at ≤20°C with a circulating water bath, while 0.60 amp is applied for 26 hr. After transfer to a suitable vessel, the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure providing heterocycle 2 as a clear, colorless syrup. The residue is dissolved in 425 mL of acetone, 20 g of cation exchange resin is added, and the suspension is then heated at reflux for 1 hr. The resin catalyst is collected by filtration and rinsed with an additional 100 mL of acetone, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure affording heterocycle 3 as a light yellow gum. The crude material is dissolved in 150 mL of ethyl acetate and washed twice with 50-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer is dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and crystallization is allowed to occur by slow evaporation of the solvent. The crystals are collected affording 30–46.8 g (48–68% from asparagine) of large, clear, colorless crystals of heterocycle 3, mp 142–143°C, [α]D+416.6° (EtOAc, c 1.70).
This filtrate is stirred into 3 l. of cold water; the 6-bromo-2-naphthol which is precipitated is filtered with suction, removed from the funnel, and washed by stirring with 1 l. of cold water. After filtering again and drying at 100° there is obtained 214–223 g. (96–100%) of 6-bromo-2-naphthol. This crude product, which is pink and melts at 123–127°, contains some tin but is pure enough for most purposes.
A. α,α'-Dicyano-β-ethyl-β-methylglutarimide. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 452 g. (4.0 moles) of ethyl cyanoacetate, 144 g. (2.0 moles) of methyl ethyl ketone, 2 g. of ammonium acetate, and 800 ml. of 95% ethanol which contains 80 g. (4.7 moles) of anhydrous ammonia and. The flask is stoppered and placed in a refrigerator.
A solution of 156 g. (1.32 moles) of ethyl carbonate in 200 cc. of ether is added to the Grignard reagent, with rapid stirring, over a period of approximately three hours. The reaction is vigorous, and the ether refluxes continually. After all the diethyl carbonate has been added, the flask is heated on a water bath and stirring is continued for another hour.
A. 1-Methyl-2-oxo-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid 2-propenyl ester. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stir bar (38 × 8 mm) is charged with 50.0 g of pimelic acid (313 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 156 mL of toluene, and 63.9 mL of allyl alcohol (939 mmol, 3.00 equiv). The mixture is stirred vigorously to create a uniform suspension, and 297 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (1.57 mmol, 0.005 equiv) is added. A Dean-Stark trap and a water-cooled condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold are affixed to the flask, and the resulting suspension is heated to reflux (120 °C oil bath temperature). The mixture in the flask soon became homogeneous. After 16 h at reflux, approximately 11 mL of water had accrued in the Dean-Stark trap. The vessel is cooled to ambient temperature and the solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL). The organic solution is washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 × 15 mL) and brine (2 × 15 mL) and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (6 g). After filtration through cotton, the organic solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (60 °C, 15 mmHg) and then the last traces of solvent are removed under high vacuum (0.15 mmHg) to yield 72.3–74.6 g of diallyl pimelate (301–311 mmol, 96–99% yield) as a slightly yellow-colored, free-flowing liquid. GC analysis indicated >99% purity.
(B) Epibromohydrin.—In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 2140 g. (1 l., 9.8 moles) of glycerol α,γ-dibromohydrin (p. 308) is suspended in 1.5 l. of water, and 400 g. of technical, powdered calcium hydroxide (88 per cent) is added gradually, with shaking, in the course of about fifteen minutes. A further 400 g. of calcium hydroxide (total, 9.5 moles) is added at once, and the epibromohydrin is distilled at reduced pressure in the manner described for epichlorohydrin. The combined lower layers from two such distillations (about 750 cc.) are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and fractionated at atmospheric or reduced pressure. The yield of epibromohydrin, b.p. 134–136° or 61–62°/50 mm., is 1130–1200 g. (84–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A solution of 64 g. (0.5 mole) of cycloöctanol in 1.25 l. of acetone is added to a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a long-stem dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a powerful mechanical stirrer. The vigorously agitated solution is cooled in a water bath to about 20°. The chromic acid oxidizing reagent is added from the dropping funnel as a slow stream, and the rate of addition is adjusted so that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 35°. The addition is continued until the characteristic orange color of the reagent persists for about 20 minutes and. The volume of reagent added is about 120 ml.
The product, (mp 122–146°C, 33–36 g, 81–88%) can be shown from its 1H NMR spectrum to be a 5:1 mixture of the E- and Z-isomers of 4-acetylpyridine oxime. To obtain pure E-isomer, the product is recrystallized twice as follows. The crude product is dissolved in 600 mL of hot water in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask, the hot solution is decanted from any undissolved residue, and the supernatant liquid is allowed to cool slowly to 30°C during 2–3 hr by placing the flask on a cork ring. The precipitate is collected at this temperature by suction filtration. A second crystallization by the same procedure yields pure E-oxime, which is dried under reduced pressure over Drierite to constant weight. The yield of E-4-acetylpyridine oxime, mp 154–157°C, is 27.1–28.3 g (66–69%).
The precipitate is collected on filter paper in a Büchner funnel by vacuum filtration and washed with 100 ml. of absolute ethanol. The solid is slurried in three 75-ml. portions of distilled water, 100 ml. of absolute ethanol, two 100-ml. portions of reagent grade acetone, and two 100-ml. portions of anhydrous ethyl ether. The filter cake is pressed dry in the funnel with suction using a piece of rubber dam, transferred to a tared, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, and dried under reduced pressure (0.01 mm.) at room temperature for 24 hours, yielding 51–54 g. (88–94%) of the silver salt of succinimide.
D. 2,5-Di-tert-butyl-3,6-dichloro-1,4-benezoquinone. A 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with a solution of 116.6 g. (0.3582 mole) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-3,5,6-trichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione in 800 ml. of ether. To the vigorously swirled solution is added, in one portion, 26.2 g. (0.359 mole) of diethylamine dissolved in ca. 50 ml. of ether. The reaction,which is instantaneous, results in a voluminous precipitate. The reaction mixture is washed with two 1-l. portions of water and then with 500 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product, a yellow semisolid (109 g.), is dissolved in 300 ml. of hot ethanol, then cooled first to room temperature and finally to 0°. After crystallization has begun, the flask is left at −5° to −10° overnight. The product is filtered, washed with 85% ethanol, and air dried, yielding 62–70 g. (60–67%) of yellow crystalline 2,5-di-tert-butyl-3,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone, m.p. 68–69° and.
C. 1-(Dimethyl(phenyl)silyl)propan-1-one. A flame-dried, 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen inlet, a Teflon-coated thermocouple and a rubber septum, is charged with of 1-morpholinopropan-1-one (6.0 g, 41.9 mmol) by syringe under a nitrogen atmosphere from a manifold. To the flask is added 45 mL of THF by syringe. The solution is then cooled to −74 °C (internal) with a dry ice/acetone bath and dimethylphenylsilyllithium in THF (0.97 M solution, 52 mL, 50.4 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is added dropwise by syringe over 8 min such that the internal temperature never rises above −60 °C. The purple reaction mixture is stirred for 70 min at −75 °C, quenched with 100 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution, and then is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The mixture is diluted with 40 mL of water in a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted with hexanes (150 mL) and ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (50 mL) and brine (100 mL), then are dried over 11 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered through glass wool, and concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (10 mm Hg). The residue is further dried by azeotropic evaporation with hexanes (2 × 50 mL, 10 mmHg) to afford 10.0 g of a light-yellow oil. The product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (50 mm column diameter, 150 g silica gel, packed with precooled hexanes (−15 °C)) using a gradient of precooled solvents (hexanes/CH2Cl2: 1/0 (350 mL), 10/1 (500 mL), 5/1 (550 mL), 1/1 (450 mL), 0/1 (250 mL), 60 mL fractions) to provide the acylsilane (5.30 g, 66%) as a light yellow oil and 0.63 g (8%) of a less pure fraction. The larger portion was distilled using a 65-mm Vigreaux column (oil bath, 130 °C) to afford 4.73 g (59%) of 1-(dimethyl(phenyl)silyl)propan-1-one as a light-yellow oil (bp 69–72 °C at 0.94 mmHg).
(1R)-(+)-α-Pinene (25.0 g, 0.183 mol, [α]D20 +50.9° (neat), 98.6% ee) and 350 mL of dry benzene are placed in a base-washed, 1000-mL Morton flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, internal thermometer, and gas inlet. The flask is set in a heating mantle and warmed to 65°C, at which point lead tetraacetate (77.8 g, 0.175 mol) is added via Gooch tubing over 20 min. The reaction mixture becomes bright yellow, this color slowly changing to tan after heating at 65°C with stirring for 1 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 1-in pad of Celite. The Celite is washed with several 50-mL portions of benzene. To the filtrate is added 300 mL of water, at which point brown-black lead oxide precipitates. The two-phase system is swirled vigorously at 10-min intervals for an hour and then filtered through a 1-in pad of Celite. The layers of the filtrate are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 150-mL portions of ether. The combined organic fractions are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at room temperature to give a mixture of acetates as a colorless liquid.
In a 2-l. two-necked flask fitted with a short reflux condenser and mechanical stirrer are placed 400 cc. of dry xylene and 29 g. (1.26 atoms) of clean sodium cut in small pieces. The flask is surrounded by an oil bath and heated until the sodium has melted. At this point the stirrer is started and the sodium is broken up into very small particles. The oil bath is removed, but stirring is continued until the sodium has solidified in very fine particles. The xylene is then poured off, and to the sodium is added 460 cc. (4.7 moles) of absolute ethyl acetate containing 3–4 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol. The flask is quickly cooled to 0° and 106 g. (1 mole) of pure benzaldehyde is added slowly from a separatory funnel while the mixture is stirred. The temperature is held between 0 and 5°. The reaction starts as soon as the benzaldehyde is added, as is shown by the production of a reddish substance on the particles of the sodium. About one and one-half to two hours are required for this addition. The stirring is continued until practically all of the sodium has reacted (one hour after all the aldehyde has been added).
D. 1-(4-tert-Butylcyclohexen-1-yl)-2-propen-1-one. To a dry, 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, and a gas inlet connected to a static argon atmosphere, are added 1.12 g (0.968 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), 13.2 g (0.312 mol) of lithium chloride, and 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran, followed by a solution of 28.6 g (0.100 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate and 19.1 g (0.100 mol) of trimethylvinyltin in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and then an additional 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran. A gas bag filled with carbon monoxide is attached to the gas inlet and the apparatus is flushed with carbon monoxide. The gas bag is refilled with carbon monoxide and reattached to the gas inlet. The mixture is then heated to 55°C. After 2–4 hr, a large amount of the carbon monoxide has been absorbed into solution and the gas bag is refilled and reattached to the gas inlet. After a total of 40 hr, the reaction mixture darkens and is cooled to room temperature. This solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, diluted with 500 mL of pentane, and washed successively with two 300-mL portions each of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, water again, and saturated sodium chloride solution. The resulting yellow solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 6 × 4-cm pad of silica gel, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Slow bulb-to-bulb distillation and of the brown oil at 85–95°C (0.35 mm) gives 14.3–14.5 g (74–75%) of the product as a colorless oil.
A. Triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate (not isolated). A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. All parts of the apparatus should be scrupulously dry. Three hundred milliliters of anhydrous ethanol is placed in the flask, and 14.1 g. (0.61 g. atom) of clean sodium, cut in pieces as large as will easily pass through a neck of the flask, is added rapidly. The neck of the flask is immediately closed, and the mixture is stirred until all the sodium has dissolved; the cooling bath is removed, and heat is applied if the reaction becomes sluggish at the end.
The condenser is set for reflux, and the steam bath is replaced with a more potent source of heat (electric heating mantle, oil bath, or direct flame). Concentrated hydrochloric acid is added with stirring, cautiously at first because a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is evolved. A total of 800 ml. of acid is added in about 10 minutes. The mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 20 minutes, then cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 480 g. of sodium hydroxide in 600 ml. of water is added to the stirred mixture as rapidly as possible, without allowing the temperature to go above 50°. The mixture is then heated under reflux for an additional 30 minutes.
Four hundred milliliters of a saturated aqueous solution of potassium-sodium tartrate is added to the mixture, and the organic layer becomes clear and orange. The stirrer assembly is removed, and the mixture is steam-distilled until about 6 l. of distillate has been collected. The residual mixture is cooled and extracted successively with one 300-ml. portion and two 100-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform is removed by distillation on the steam bath at reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residual viscous amber oil is dissolved by heating in 150 ml. of methanol. When the solution has cooled to about 40°, seeds of cholestenone are added, and the flask is wrapped with a small towel to ensure slow cooling. After the bulk of the material has crystallized, which requires several hours, the mixture is stored at 0° overnight. The product is collected by suction filtration, washed with 40–50 ml. of methanol previously cooled in an ice-salt bath, then dried at reduced pressure, first at room temperature and finally at 60°. The yield of light-cream-colored Δ4-cholesten-3-one is 81–93 g. (81–93%), m.p. 76–79°. Recrystallization from methanol gives material melting at 79.5–80.5° in 90% recovery.
After the nitric acid has been added, stirring is continued for fifteen minutes longer; the mixture is then poured upon 1300 g. of cracked ice. The crude methyl m-nitrobenzoate separates as a solid and is filtered off by means of suction and washed with water. The product is placed in a flask and agitated with 200 cc. of ice-cold methyl alcohol in order to remove a small amount of o-nitrobenzoic ester and other impurities that are present. The cooled mixture is then filtered by means of suction, washed with another 100-cc. portion of cold methyl alcohol, and the solid dried. The yield is 220–230 g. (81–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of an almost colorless product melting at 74–76°. In order to obtain a product of maximum purity, which melts at 78°, it is advisable to recrystallize the ester from an equal weight of methyl alcohol.
Magnesium turnings (72.6 g, 3 g-atom) and 1000 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether are placed under argon in a dry, 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a Claisen adapter, a thermometer, an ice–water-cooled condenser, and an argon inlet. The dropping funnel is charged with allyl bromide (158 mL, 1.8 mol) in 150 mL of anhydrous ether. Stirring is initiated and a 10–12-mL portion of the allyl bromide solution is run into the reaction flask. The resulting mixture is treated with a few crystals of iodine, whereupon a rise in temperature and clouding of the reaction mixture occurs, indicating that the reaction has begun. The remainder of the allyl bromide solution is added dropwise with continued stirring at such a rate as to maintain a gentle reflux. The addition requires approximately 1.5 hr. The mixture is then refluxed for an additional 1.5 hr.
B. 2α,4α-Dimethyl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one (2). A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 100-ml. dropping funnel having a nitrogen inlet tube, a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and an efficient double-surface condenser carrying a nitrogen outlet tube connected to a bubbler, and placed on a combined hotplate–magnetic stirring unit in a heat-resistant glass dish, acting as a water bath. Dry acetonitrile (200 ml.) is introduced into the flask, followed by 90 g. (0.60 mole) of dried powdered sodium iodide, with vigorous stirring under a slow stream of nitrogen. When the stirring bar rotates steadily, 20 g. (0.31 g.-atom) of powdered copper bronze is added, followed by 28 g. (30 ml., 0.41 mole) of freshly-distilled furan. The dropping funnel is then charged with a solution of 24.4 g. (0.100 mole) of dibromoketone 1 in 50 ml. of dry acetonitrile, which is rapidly added to the stirred reaction mixture. On addition of dibromoketone 1, the temperature rises to 45–50°, and a characteristic oatmeal-colored precipitate forms. After about 2 hours the temperature begins to drop, and the reaction is maintained at 50–60° with the water bath for a total reaction time of 4 hours.
D. Resolution of the dl-diamine: (R,R)-(+)-N,N'-Dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine and (S,S)-(−)-N,N'-Dimethyl-1,2-diphenylethylenediamine . A 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a water condenser, is charged with pure dl-diamine (12 g, 0.05 mol) , natural L-(+)-tartaric acid (7.1 g, 0.05 mol) and absolute ethanol (350 mL). The heterogeneous mixture is brought to reflux and the precipitate dissolves completely. After 30 min the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and stand overnight (17 hr). The precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with ethanol (2 × 50 mL). The salt is added to a mixture of aqueous 35% (w/w) NaOH (30 mL), demineralized water (100 mL) and Et2O (100 mL). The solution is stirred for 30 min, and the phases are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (2 × 100 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over K2CO3. The solids are removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to give 5.5 g (90%) of crude (R,R)-diamine as a white powder, mp 49-50°C. The mother liquor is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residue is stirred with a mixture of aqueous 35% (w/w) NaOH (30 mL), demineralized water (100 mL) and Et2O (100 mL). The solution is stirred for 30 min, and the phases are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (2 × 100 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over K2CO3. The solids are removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to give 6.15 g (101%) of crude (S,S)-diamine as an oil that solidifies upon drying under reduced pressure, mp 45-48°C.
The aniline recovered amounts to 250–260 g. (89–92 per cent of the theoretical amount), and the yield of benzylaniline is 155–160 g. (85–87 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzyl chloride). The product solidifies on cooling and melts at 33–36°. It is practically colorless and sufficiently pure for most synthetic purposes. A pure compound melting at 36° may be obtained by crystallizing the product from about 100 cc. of ligroin (b.p. 85–90°). The solution is cooled in a freezing mixture to cause crystallization, the crystals filtered with suction, washed with a little cold ligroin, pressed, and dried. The recovery is about 90 per cent of the original product.
C. Diethyl 2-(cyclohexylamino)vinylphosphonate. A 1-l., two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 90.0 g. (0.500 mole) of diethyl formylmethylphosphonate and 400 ml. of dry methanol. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, 49.6 g. (0.501 mole) of cyclohexylamine is added in portions to the stirred solution, over a period of 5 minutes. During the addition the temperature is maintained at 0–5° with an ice bath. The mixture is stirred for an additional 10 minutes at room temperature, and then the methanol is distilled from the mixture under reduced pressure (10–35 mm.) at water bath temperatures (25–30°). The residue is dissolved in 300 ml. of dry diethyl ether, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate (70 g.), and evaporated to dryness. The residual oil is fractionated under reduced pressure in the presence of 300 mg. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the fraction boiling at 126–141° (0.08 mm.) is collected, giving 89 g. (68%). The fraction above is crystallized from dry pentane, yielding 79 g. (60%) of diethyl 2-(cyclohexylamino)vinylphosphonate, m.p. 58–61°.
A. 1-Cyclopropylcyclopropanol. A 4-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and reflux condenser is charged under nitrogen with 120.2 g (122 mL, 1.2 mol) of methyl cyclopropanecarboxylate, 85.3 g (89.3 mL; 0.30 mol) of titanium tetraisopropoxide , and 1.45 L of anhydrous ether. To the well-stirred solution, 840 mL (2.52 mol) of ethylmagnesium bromide as a 3 M solution in ether is added over a period of 4 hr. The temperature is maintained between 20°C and 25°C with a water bath. After the addition is complete the black or dark-brown mixture is stirred for an additional 0.5 hr at the same temperature, then cooled to −5°C, and the reaction is quenched by careful addition of 1.56 L of ice-cold aqueous 10% sulfuric acid while the temperature is maintained between −5°C and 0°C with an acetone-dry ice bath. The mixture is stirred at 0°C for an additional 1 hr, in which time the precipitate should have completely dissolved, and then is transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel. The inorganic phase is extracted with 360 mL of ether. The combined ethereal phases are washed with two 600-mL portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, 600 mL of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , and filtered. The solvent is removed from the filtrate under water-aspirator vacuum at 20°Cto give 116 g (99%) of 1-cyclopropylcyclopropanol that is used without further purification.
The reaction mixture is placed in a separatory funnel; the aqueous phase is separated and extracted twice with chloroform (CHCl3). The organic phases are combined, washed twice with water, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate overnight. After filtration to remove sodium sulfate, concentration under vacuum affords a residue, which is heated (5 mm, 130°C oil bath) to remove and recover excess di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. A total of 33.2 g (83 mmol) of crude ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl)glycinate, is obtained as an oil and used directly in the subsequent lactonization reaction.
B. 1,3-Bis(methylthio)-2-methoxypropane. A dry, 1-l., three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 60-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 13.8 g. (0.339 mole) of sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil. The mineral oil is removed by washing the dispersion with five 100-ml. portions of hexane, which is removed with a pipet after the sodium hydride has been allowed to settle.
B. 1,2-Dimethyl-1,2-epoxycyclohex-4-ene. A 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel is charged with 41 g. (0.38 mole) of 1,2-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadine. Over a period of 2 hours 80 g. (0.46 mole of 85% assay) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid dissolved in 1 l. of chloroform is added with vigorous stirring. The mixture is heated to reflux on a steam bath for 3 hours and kept overnight. The contents of the flask are cooled in an ice bath and the precipitated m-chlorobenzoic acid is removed by filtration. The organic layer is washed with 25 ml. of 20% sodium bisulfite solution, three 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, in that order. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and distilled through a 30-cm. glass bead-packed column to afford 32.3–36.8 g. (68–78%) of the epoxide, b.p. 55–57° (15 mm.); n20D 1.4642–1.4650.
A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and an air-driven stirring apparatus. After the system has been thoroughly purged with nitrogen, it is charged with a solution of 100 g. (0.615 mole) of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexamethylbicyclo[2.2.0]hexa-2,5-diene (Hexamethyldewarbenzene) in 200 ml. of toluene. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0° with a bath of ice water and stirred rapidly while a solution of 130 g. (0.640 mole) of 85% m-chloroperbenzoic acid in 1.5 l. of chloroform is added dropwise over 3–4 hours. Throughout the addition and for 4 hours following its completion the reaction mixture is kept at 0°, after which it is stirred at room temperature for 36 hours. The white precipitate that forms during the reaction (mainly m-chlorobenzoic acid) is removed by filtration through a 650-ml., sintered-glass funnel (porosity 10–15 μm), and the filter cake is washed with two 100-ml. portions of chloroform. Combination of the filtrates gives a chloroform–toluene solution, which is condensed on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 35–40°. When all of the chloroform has been removed, the residual toluene solution is diluted with 500 ml. of pentane and refiltered. The filtrate is washed with four 200-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide and two 250-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 50°. Traces of toluene are removed under high vacuum (0.02 mm.) at 25°, and the residue is distilled. Collection of material boiling between 72° and 95° (4 mm.) gives about 50 g. of crude product, which is further purified by dissolving it in 50 ml. of pentane and cooling the pentane solution at −78° for several hours. The resulting white crystals are collected by filtration and dried, giving 31.3–37.5 g. (29–34%) of pure 5-acetyl-1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene, m.p. 54–56° and.
The crude product contains a small amount of unreduced dilactam, which can be detected in the IR spectrum. Treatment of the crude diimine again under the identical reduction conditions using the same amounts of the reagent and solvent gives 10.6 g. (83%) of product. Distillation under reduced pressure through a semimicro Vigreux column (10-cm.) yields 9.5 g. (75%) of pure 1,10-diazacycloöctadecane, b.p. 120–130° (0.05 mm.), m.p. 59–61°.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser is placed 2.0 l. of anhydrous ethanol. To this is added 11.5 g. (0.5 g. atom) of sodium cut into small pieces. When the sodium is completely dissolved, 23.6 g. (21.0 ml., 0.25 mole) of 1,2-ethanedithiol (p. 401) is added, followed by 47.0 g. (21.7 ml., 0.25 mole) of ethylene dibromide. The mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 4 hours, cooled, and filtered to remove some sodium bromide mixed with polyethylene sulfide. The solid is washed with 100 ml. of ethanol, and the combined filtrates are distilled with stirring. When bumping becomes troublesome, as it generally does when 1.3–1.5 l. of distillate has been collected, the hot reaction mixture is filtered to remove sodium bromide, and the sodium bromide is washed with 100 ml. of hot ethanol.
C. 3,6,9-Tris(p-tolylsulfonyl)-3,6,9-triazaundecane-1,11-diol (3). A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser, and heating mantle is charged with 226 g. (0.400 mole) of triamine 1, 77.5 g. (0.881 mole) of ethylene carbonate, and 0.7 g. of powdered potassium hydroxide. The stirred mixture is heated at 160–170° for 4 hours. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to 90°, and 500 ml. of methanol is added through the condenser as rapidly as possible. The solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, treated with 5 g. of activated carbon, and filtered through Celite. Water (120–140 ml.) is added dropwise to the stirred filtrate until the cloud point is reached. After crystallization is complete, diol 3 is collected and washed with 3 : 1 water–ethanol and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°, yielding 225–240 g. (86–92%) of colorless product, m.p. 108–112°.
C. (1S,2S)-(−)- and (1R,2R)-(+)-1,2-Diphenyl-1,2-ethylenediamine. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer is charged with 42.5 g (0.200 mol) of the racemic diamine and 230 mL of ethanol. The solids are dissolved by heating the mixture to 70°C whereupon a hot (70°C), homogeneous solution, of 30.0 g (0.200 mol) of L-(+)-tartaric acid in 230 mL of ethanol is added. The tartrate salts precipitate immediately, and after the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, the crystals are collected by filtration, washed twice with 60 mL of ethanol, and dried under reduced pressure. The solids are dissolved in 230 mL of boiling water, 230 mL of ethanol is added and the homogeneous solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The crystals are collected by filtration, washed with 40 mL of ethanol and dried under reduced pressure. The recrystallization procedure is then repeated twice using the same volumes of solvents (230 mL of water and 230 mL of ethanol) to give 23–25 g (63–69%) of the tartrate salt as colorless crystals, [α]23D −10.8 ± 0.2° (H2O, c 1.3), lit.5 [α]23D −11° (H2O).
Purification by the Method of Anderson and Nabenhauer.1—A solution of 20 g. of crude, partially or completely acetylated dihydrocholesterol in 200 cc. of carbon tetrachloride is placed in a separatory funnel and treated with 100 cc. of acetic anhydride. About 5 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added dropwise through the stem of the inverted funnel with cooling and shaking until there is no further increase in color. A blue or green color develops, the intensity depending on the amount of cholesterol present in the sample. After fifteen to twenty minutes about 10 cc. of water is added, by drops and with cooling and gentle shaking until two distinct layers form. The carbon tetrachloride solution (upper layer) is separated and washed free of acid with sodium chloride or sodium carbonate solution (pure water gives emulsions). After drying with sodium sulfate, the solvent is removed by distillation at diminished pressure and the residue is saponified as above with alcoholic alkali and crystallized from alcohol. The purified dihydrocholesterol weighs 12–14 g. and melts, after thorough drying, at 142–143°. It gives a faint Liebermann-Burchard reaction only after ten to fifteen minutes.
B. Diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate. A mixture of 112 g. (0.47 mole) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1] hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate and 125 ml. of absolute ethanol is placed in a standard Paar bottle along with 0.2 g. of 5% palladium on carbon catalyst. The bottle is attached to the Paar hydrogenation apparatus, and shaking is begun using an initial pressure of 60 p.s.i. After 2 hours, hydrogen uptake ceases. The mixture is gravity-filtered twice and the ethanol is removed using a rotary evaporator. The entire procedure is repeated on a second batch and the crude product from the combined runs is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed boiling flask fitted with a 15-cm. Vigreux column. Fractional distillation gives 218–223 g. (95–97%) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate, b.p. 107–108° (0.05 mm.), n22D = 1.4730.
Thirteen hundred milliliters of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (glyme) is distilled from lithium aluminum hydride (Caution! Under no circumstances should distillation be carried to dryness since explosive decomposition of the residual hydride may occur.) directly into a 2-l., nitrogen-flushed, three-necked, Morton flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet, an outlet, and a high-speed stirrer with a stainless steel propeller-type blade. The flask is charged with 89.7 g. (0.87 mole) of t-nitrobutane and 19.9 g. (0.87 g. atom) of sodium cut into pea-sized pieces. The stirrer is started and initially operated at a speed just adequate to draw some of the sodium through the blade. The onset of reaction is signaled when the solution is pale lavender and the sodium surface is clearly etched and colored bright gold. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 25–30° by directing an air blast at the sides of the flask and by controlling the rate at which sodium is drawn through the blades of the stirrer. As the reaction progresses, colorless solid is formed, and at the end of the reaction (ca. 24 hours) the reaction mixture consists of solid and a colorless glyme solution. Most of the glyme is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure at room temperature with a water bath at 20–25° to leave a thick, colorless slurry. To the slurry under nitrogen is added 270 ml. of water, and the reddish brown organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with several portions of pentane until the extract is colorless. The organic layer and pentane extracts are combined, cooled to 0°, and washed rapidly and thoroughly with two 70-ml. portions of ice-cold 0.25N hydrochloric acid to remove hydroxylamine impurities. The pentane solution of the product is washed immediately with 70 ml. of cold water followed by 70 ml. of cold, aqueous 0.2N sodium hydroxide. The combined, cold, aqueous acidic washings are extracted with small portions of pentane until colorless. This pentane extract is used to extract the aqueous sodium hydroxide layer and is then washed with water and combined with the initial pentane extract.
A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a dry ice condenser charged with an ice-salt mixture. Three hundred milliliters (240 g., 3.7 moles) of aqueous 70% ethylamine solution is placed in the flask, the stirrer is started, and 200 g. (1.00 mole) of 2,3-dibromopropene is added dropwise over a period of 1 hour. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hours. Ether (300 ml.) is added, and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. Sodium hydroxide (100 g.) is added with stirring and cooling. The cold mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the phases are separated. The organic layer is dried in two stages over 25-g. portions of sodium hydroxide. The organic layer and the small amount of water that separates during the second stage of drying are decanted into a separatory funnel, and the phases are separated. Most of the ether and unreacted ethylamine are removed from the organic layer by distillation through a 250-mm. × 13-mm. column packed with glass helices, and the residue is distilled through the same column at reduced pressure under nitrogen to give 115–128 g. (70–78%) of N-(2-bromoallyl)ethylamine; b.p. 53–55° (27 mm.), 79–81° (75 mm.); n25D 1.4765–1.4770.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask, fitted with an efficient stirrer, a stopper, and a reflux condenser, are placed, in order, 184.2 g. (1 mole) of benzidine, 500 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol, about 125 g. of Raney nickel,2 and 500 ml. of ethanol. The mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for a total of 15 hours. The volume is brought to 3 l. with 95% ethanol, and about 150 g. of filter aid ("Super-Cel") is added with stirring. The mixture is heated to boiling, filtered rapidly through a ¼-in. layer of filter aid on a Büchner funnel into a 4-l. filter flask and, and the nickel is washed well with hot 95% ethanol. The filtrate is concentrated to a volume of 1.5 l., cooled slowly to room temperature, then chilled in a refrigerator and filtered. The yield is 185–202 g. (77–84%) of light gray or purplish gray flakes, m.p. 105–115°.
About 5 minutes later, the liquid contents of the beaker are poured cautiously into a 2-l. glass beaker, and this is tipped and rotated slowly so as to spread the congealing mass in a thin film on the beaker walls. When the material in the beakers has cooled, a total of 1 l. of water is poured into the beakers and the water is stirred well for at least 1 hour. The cold suspension is filtered with suction to separate 200–210 g. of an insoluble mixture of lead monoxide and red lead, which is washed on the filter with six 50-ml. portions of water.
A. Diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate. To a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an efficient reflux condenser are added 69 g (64.4 mL, 0.5 mol) of diethyl phosphite, 15 g (0.5 mol) of paraformaldehyde, and 5.1 g (0.05 mol) of triethylamine. The mixture is placed in an oil bath preheated to 100–120°C. The temperature is increased to 120–130°C, and the mixture is stirred at this temperature for 4 hr. The stirring bar is removed, the flask is transferred to a rotary evaporator, and most of the triethylamine is removed by heating under reduced pressure of ca. 15 mm and with a bath temperature of ca. 80°C. Kugelrohr distillation at 125°C (0.05 mm) gives 41.4–54.9 g (49–65%) of material of sufficient purity for the next step and.
C. Hexahydro-4,4,7-trimethyl-4H-1,3-benzoxathiin. To a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with 325 mL of benzene is added 140.0 g (0.753 mol) of 5-methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-thioethyl)cyclohexanol, 26.0 g (0.87 mol) of paraformaldehyde and 1 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The flask is fitted with a Dean–Stark trap and a Friedrich condenser and the contents are refluxed for 4 hr, by which time the benzene distillate is clear. After the solution is cooled, 5 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate is added and the solution is stirred overnight, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation and the residual liquid is distilled in a good vacuum to give a fraction of bp 69–94°C (0.1 mm), which weighs 130–134 g (86–89%). This fraction is dissolved in 250 mL of pentane, cooled to −25°C, and seeded with a crystal of the product. Crystallization is allowed to proceed in a freezer, and collection and concentration of the mother liquor to half the original volume are carried out every other day to yield, after four crops of crystals are collected, 55–60 g (37–40%) of the spectrally pure product.
C. (S)-(−)-1-Formyl-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine. A 4-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser, a low-temperature thermometer, and a mineral oil bubbler is charged with a solution of the crude formyl derivative in 1.5 L of dry tetrahydrofuran and flushed with argon. The solution is cooled to −50 to −60°C (internal temperature, acetone–dry ice), the cooling bath is removed, and 81 mL (1.3 mol) of methyl iodide is added. Then 28.8 g (1.2 mol) of sodium hydride is introduced carefully in one portion.
The preparation is carried out in a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with two graphite rod electrodes. To the flask are added 132 g (1.0 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-propanedioate, 15 g (0.10 mol) of sodium iodide, and 300 mL of methanol. A thermometer and reflux condenser are attached; the mixture is stirred and the solution formed is heated to 60°C. The heat source is removed. The solution is electrolyzed with a constant current of 2.0 A for 13.5 hr with gentle magnetic stirring. After a few minutes of electrolysis, the electrolyte begins to reflux gently and reflux is maintained throughout the electrolysis period by the heating effect of current passage. Small granular crystals of the product begin to separate toward the end of the electrolysis period.
A. 2(5H)-Furanone. A 6-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two condensers, a dropping funnel, and a 12 × 55-mm magnetic stirring bar is charged with 480 g (5 mol) of furfural and 2.0 L of methylene chloride. The addition of 200 g of sodium sulfate and 150 g of N,N-dimethylethanolamine in one portion each is followed immediately by 460 g of formic acid, carefully added in portions over a period of 2 min, after which 100 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred vigorously. After 5 min the mixture will reflux and another 800 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise during 9 hr while stirring is continued. When the addition is complete, the mixture is vigorously stirred as long as it refluxes and then stirred gently overnight. The organic phase is separated, and the water phase is extracted with the 200 mL of methylene chloride that is used to wash out residues from the reaction flask.
Most of the alcohol is distilled off under slightly reduced pressure on the steam bath and the residue is poured into sufficient distilled water to dissolve all the solid. The water layer is separated and extracted four times with carbon tetrachloride, which is added to the ester layer. The ester-carbon tetrachloride mixture is washed twice with water and the water washings extracted once with carbon tetrachloride. The carbon tetrachloride is distilled off under atmospheric pressure through a column, the moisture being carried over simultaneously.
B. t-Butyl α-diazoacetoacetate. In a 2-l., wide-mouthed, Erlenmeyer flask are placed 118.5 g. (0.75 mole) of t-butyl acetoacetate, 1 l. of anhydrous acetonitrile, and 75.8 g. (0.75 mole) of previously distilled triethylamine (b.p. 88.5–90.5°). The temperature of the mixture is adjusted to 20°, and 148 g. (0.75 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl azide is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over 10–15 minutes. The addition causes the reaction mixture to warm to 38–40° and assume a yellow color. After the mixture has been stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hours, the solvent is evaporated at 35° (12 mm.). The partially crystalline residue is triturated with 1 l. of ether, and the mixture, including the insoluble residue, is placed in a 2-l. separatory funnel. The mixture is washed successively with a solution of 45 g. of potassium hydroxide in 500 ml. of water, a solution of 7.5 g. of potassium hydroxide in 250 ml. of water, and 250 ml. of water. The yellow-orange ethereal phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated at 35° (15 mm.) until the residue has attained a constant weight. The yellow-orange diazo ester weighs 130–135 g. (94–98%).
The combined aqueous phases are acidified to Congo red with 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with three portions of benzene (200 ml., 75 ml., 75 ml.). The benzene extracts are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, then filtered through anhydrous sodium sulfate. The combined extract is flash-distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask at atmospheric pressure (bath temperature, up to 160°). The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to give 94–96 g. (91–93%) of acid; b.p. 173–177°/7 mm. (bath temperature, 207–220°), nD25 1.5160–1.5163 and.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and protected by a calcium chloride tube are placed 150 g. (1.1 moles) of phenylacetic acid (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), 147 g. (1.1 moles) of freshly distilled cinnamic aldehyde, 122 g. of litharge, and 155 cc. of acetic anhydride. The mixture is boiled for five hours, poured while still hot into a beaker, and allowed to stand overnight. The semisolid contents are stirred to a mush, filtered with suction in a large Büchner funnel, and pressed dry. The solid is washed on the funnel with two 35-cc. portions of ethyl alcohol, the material being stirred thoroughly before suction is applied. The cake is transferred to a beaker, stirred to a mush with 50 cc. of alcohol, and again filtered with suction. The material is washed with another 50-cc. portion of alcohol in the same manner. The product, which is light yellow to tan in color, weighs 62–67 g. (27–29 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 149.5–153.5°.
A solution of lithium methoxide, prepared from 0.015 g. of lithium in 200 ml. of methanol, is added to the ether solution, and the resulting mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour. The volume is reduced to 200 ml. by distillation using a rotary evaporator at room temperature (20 mm.) before the solution is added to 600 ml. of an ice-water mixture containing 3 g. of sodium bisulfite. The solid product that separates is collected by filtration, washed with water, and air-dried. The crude carbamate (57–64 g.) is dissolved in 180 ml. of hot methanol. The resulting mixture, which is slightly cloudy, is filtered rapidly through a coarse, fluted filter paper. The filtrate is warmed to redissolve the product, and 30 ml. of water is added slowly while the solution is heated. The flask is allowed to stand overnight, then cooled to 0°. The resulting solid crystalline is collected by filtration, washed with 10 ml. of ice-cold, 4:1 (v/v) methanol–water, and air-dried, yielding 39.6–41.0 g. (60–62%) of methyl (trans-2-iodo-1-tetralin)carbamate, m.p. 125.5–126.5°. The IR spectrum (KBr) shows strong absorption at 3220 and 1685 cm.−1.
B. Tetrahydro-Binor-S. Binor-S (135.0 g., 0.734 mole) is dissolved in 670 ml. of glacial acetic acid containing 5.7 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. To this solution is added 1.0 g. of platinum oxide catalyst. The reaction mixture is hydrogenated at 200 p.s.i. hydrogen pressure and 70° for 3 hours, using a 1200-ml., glass-lined autoclave. After cooling to room temperature, the catalyst is removed with suction filtration, and water (ca. 1.5 l.) is added to the filtrate until two layers form. The bottom layer, containing only tetrahydro-Binor-S, is removed, and the top layer, consisting of a mixture of acetic acid and water, is extracted with one 400 ml. and two 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane–tetrahydro-Binor-S layers are washed twice with 100 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual tetrahydro-Binor-S is purified by distillation under reduced pressure, b.p. 105–110° (1.5 mm.), giving 125–130 g. (90–94%) of colorless liquid.
The resulting emulsion is allowed to stand overnight in the refrigerator at 0–5°; the crystalline precipitate is filtered by suction and washed first with 80 cc. of ice-cold water in four portions, then with 50 cc. of a mixture of two volumes of ether and one volume of methyl alcohol, and, finally, with ether until the washings are colorless and free of benzaldehyde. After drying in a vacuum desiccator the product weighs 35–40 g.; it melts with decomposition at 206–207° (corr.).
A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared from 9.2 g. (0.40 mole) of freshly cut sodium and 400 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a thermometer, a mercury-sealed stirrer, and a condenser protected by a drying tube. To the stirred solution, which is kept at −5° (conveniently by partially immersing the flask in a Dry Ice bath), 72.4 g. (0.40 mole) of ethyl (1-ethylpropylidene) cyanoacetate (p. 399) is added dropwise from the funnel during 8–10 minutes. After the mixture has been stirred for an additional 20 minutes at −5°, 62.5 g. (0.44 mole) of methyl iodide is added from the dropping funnel as rapidly as possible. The flask is heated immediately with a strong flame which is withdrawn just as the solution reaches the boiling point. The alkylation is vigorous, but the flask is not cooled unless loss of material through the reflux condenser appears imminent. After the spontaneous reaction has subsided, the solution is refluxed until a piece of red litmus paper dipped into the liquid and subsequently moistened shows a neutral reaction (15–30 minutes).
After the ester mixture has been added, the stirrer is removed and the condenser set for downward distillation. The ether and the alcohol formed in the reaction are removed by heating on a water bath. The residue, which usually solidifies upon cooling, is treated with 600 cc. of cold, 33 per cent acetic acid solution. The mixture is allowed to stand for several hours with occasional shaking in order to decompose the sodium derivative completely, and the product is extracted with four 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether solution is washed with 1 l. of water, with two 500-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally with 1 l. of water. The ether is then removed by distillation, using a steam bath. The residue is fractionated through an efficient column. The portion boiling at 114–116°/10 mm. is collected. The yield is 363–425 g. (60–70 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Benzyl 4-(2-chloro-N-(4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)acetamido)-piperidine-1-carboxylate (5). A 1-L 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. The flask is charged with benzyl 4-(4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl-amino)piperidine-1-carboxylate (3, 25.0 g, 68 mmol, 1 equiv), ethyl acetate (250 mL), and pyridine (8.3 mL, 103 mmol, 1.5 equiv). The flask is placed in an ice-water bath and cooled to an internal temperature of 3 °C. Chloroacetyl chloride (10.1 g, 89 mmol, 1.3 equiv) is added via a 12-mL syringe over 5 min, keeping the internal temperature below 10 °C. The ice-bath is removed and the orange slurry is stirred for 1.5 h at ambient temperature. One of the septa is replaced with a 125-mL addition funnel and charged with 5% aq. KH2PO4 (125 mL), which is added to the reaction contents over 5 min while keeping the internal temperature below 25 °C. After stirring for 10 min, the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with half-saturated brine, then dried by filtration through 50 g anhydrous sodium sulfate into a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The contents are concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature: 40 °C; 100 to 50 mmHg, foaming) (38 g). Methyl t-butyl ether (150 mL) is added to the flask and concentrated (bath temperature: 40 °C; 100 to 50 mmHg, foaming) to an orange oil (35 g). The flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) and methyl t-butyl ether (150 mL) is added. The contents are warmed in a 50 °C water bath to dissolve the oil, then cooled to ambient temperature with stirring. Within 15 min the mixture turns turbid and a white solid begins to form. After stirring for 4 h, the solid is filtered using a 150-mL medium porosity sintered-glass funnel and washed with methyl t-butyl ether (75 mL). The solid is dried in a vacuum oven (70 mmHg) at 40 °C for 2 days to afford benzyl 4-(2-chloro-N-(4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)acetamido)-piperidine-1-carboxylate (5) (28.5 g, 94% yield) as an off-white solid.
A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is then charged with 5.56 g (0.028 mol) of S-tert-butyl cyclohexanecarbothioate, 5.55 g (0.075 mol) of tert-butyl alcohol, and 250 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile. The mixture is stirred vigorously and 23.7 g (0.056 mol) of mercury(II) trifluoroacetate is added in one portion. The resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 45 min and then concentrated to approximately 50–75 mL on a rotary evaporator. To this concentrated mixture is added 250 mL of hexane and the orange solid that forms is removed by filtration. The filter pad is then washed with 50 mL of hexane. The filtrate and washings are combined and washed with a 50 mL portion of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a pale-yellow liquid.
C. (R)-(−)-2-Diphenylphosphinyl-2'-hydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (4) . A 100-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 6.07 g (10.1 mmol) of (R)-(+)-2-diphenylphosphinyl-2'-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (3), 30 mL of 1,4-dioxane , and 14 mL of methanol . To the solution is added 14.1 mL of 3 N aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture is stirred for 12 hr then acidified (to pH 1) by the addition of a few drops of concd hydrochloric acid. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted twice with ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 6.19 g of 4 as a solid.. This crude material is carried on to the next step without purification, assuming 100% yield.
To a cold solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water in a 1-l. flask is added 50 g. (0.266 mole) of gallic acid. The flask is immediately tightly stoppered, and the mixture shaken occasionally until all the acid has dissolved; 89 g. (67 cc.) of dimethyl sulfate (0.71 mole) is then added and the flask is shaken for twenty minutes, being cooled by means of cold water in order that the temperature does not rise above 30–35°. Occasionally the stopper is raised to release any pressure. A second portion of 89 g. of dimethyl sulfate is then added and shaking continued for ten minutes longer. During this second addition the temperature may rise to 40–45°.
A. p-Toluenesulfonyl azide.2,3 A solution of 71.5 g. (1.10 moles) of sodium azide in 200 ml. of water is placed in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask and diluted with 400 ml. of 90% aqueous ethanol. To this solution is added with stirring a warm (45°) solution of 190.5 g. (1.00 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in 1 l. of 99% ethanol. During this addition, sodium chloride separates, and the reaction mixture has been stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hours, most of the solvent is removed at 35° (15 mm.) with a rotary evaporator. The residue is mixed with 1.2 l. of water in a separatory funnel, and the oily p-toluenesulfonyl azide is separated. This oil is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration with suction gives 160–170 g. (81–86%, based on p-toluenesulfonyl chloride) of pure, colorless p-toluenesulfonyl azide which completely crystallizes on standing at 5°.
A. 1,1-Dibromo-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser fitted with a drying tube is flushed with dry nitrogen, then charged with 25.0 g. (0.139 mole) of 1,1-diphenylethylene, 100 ml. of pentane, and 28 g. (0.25 mole) of potassium tert-butoxide. The mixture is stirred and cooled to 0° before 66.0 g. (0.261 mole) of bromoform is added dropwise over 30–45 minutes. Stirring is continued for an additional 2–3 hours at room temperature, and 200 ml. of water is added. The yellowish insoluble product is filtered, dried, and digested with 300 ml. of refluxing 2-propanol for 30 minutes. After cooling, the product is filtered and washed with 100 ml. of 2-propanol, yielding 31–38 g. (63–78%) of colorless crystals, m.p. 151–152°.
To the dark-brown combined filtrates is added 100 ml. of potassium hypochlorite solution, and the resulting solution is permitted to stand overnight. The mixture is then heated on a steam bath for 4 hours. The resulting orange solution is filtered while hot, and 100 ml. of 35% sodium hydroxide solution is added. The solution is cooled to 5°, the resulting solid is collected by filtration and washed with a small amount of saturated sodium chloride solution.
A 2-L Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 33.1 g of the crude protected diol which is dissolved in 600 mL of hot ethyl acetate (EtOAc), and the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hr and at 0°C to −5°C for 24 hr. The resulting white precipitate is collected by suction filtration through a 10-cm Büchner funnel, and the mother liquor is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 21.15 g of a pale yellow liquid that slowly crystallizes. The residual liquid is placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask, dissolved in 150 mL of hot toluene, and allowed to stand for 24 hr at 0°C to −5°C. The slightly yellow precipitate is collected by suction filtration through a 10-cm Büchner funnel and dried under reduced pressure to give 16.0–17.4 g (50–55%) of 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine, mp 73–75°C, [α]D23 −12.4° (CHCl3, c 2.62). The ee of the product is determined by HPLC analysis of the derived bis-Mosher ester to be 97%.
To 86.5 g. (0.38 mole) of ethyl hydrogen sebacate [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 276 (1943)] is added slowly and with cooling 125–130 ml. of approximately 3 N potassium hydroxide. The solution is then diluted to approximately 250 ml., yielding a 1.5 N solution of potassium ethyl sebacate.
B. (1Z)-1-(3-bromophenyl)-2-[5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinyl]-ethanone oxime (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer is charged with ketone (1) (15.0 g, 43.7 mmol). Methanol (120 mL) is added, followed by slow addition of aqueous sodium hydroxide (2.5 M, 75 mL, 188 mmol) over 5 min, which completely dissolved the ketone to give an orange solution. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (15.2 g, 219 mmol) is added in small portions over 15 min, during which the solution changed from orange to bright yellow. An additional 10 mL of methanol is used to wash down the sides of the flask. Vigorous stirring is required due to the large quantity of solids present. A reflux condenser is attached and the reaction mixture is heated in an oil bath until the internal temperature is 70 °C. The solids dissolved and the bright yellow color faded as the reaction proceeded. Once an internal temperature of 70 °C is reached, the reaction mixture is stirred for 90 min at which point only trace starting material remained as determined by TLC: product (2) Rf = 0.33 (4:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate). The oil bath is removed, the reaction solution cooled to room temperature over 30 minutes, and a solid precipitated out of solution. The reaction mixture is further cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath for 30 min, and all of the white solid material is collected by filtration using a fritted funnel (9 cm, 350 mL, M). The solid is washed with cold water (3 × 20 mL) and is dried under high vacuum (<1 mmHg) at 50 °C for 5 hours. The pale yellow solid is dissolved in methanol (75 mL) at 60 °C and water (25 mL) is added slowly at 60 °C until the solution became cloudy. The solution is cooled to room temperature over 1 h and the precipitate that formed is filtered using a fritted funnel (9 cm, 350 mL, M). The solid is washed with cold water (3 × 20 mL) and dried under high vacuum (<1 mmHg, 50 °C) overnight to give (2) as pale yellow solid (11.4 g, 72%).
A. 4-tert-Butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet, and a condenser is charged with 33.0 g (0.214 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone, 1.5 L of dichloromethane, and 49.5 g (0.241 mol) of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine. The solution is stirred under a static argon atmosphere and cooled to 0°C, at which time the dropwise addition of 40.0 mL (0.238 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is begun. After the addition is complete, the brown mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and is stirred at that temperature for 10 hr. At this point, the consumption of starting ketone is verified by thin-layer chromatography (hexane; silica gel). If the reaction is incomplete, more trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added and additional time is allowed. The solvent is removed by distillation and the resulting light-tan material is treated with 1 L of pentane and heated to reflux for 30 min. The tan salts thus obtained are removed by filtration and washed with five 100-mL portions of pentane. The combined pentane solutions are washed with two 250-mL portions each of a 10% hydrochloric acid solution, a 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 6 × 4-cm pad of silica gel, and concentrated by distillation. Bulb-to-bulb distillation of the resulting yellow oil at 75–80°C (0.5 mm) gives 43–45 g (70–73%) of the product as a colorless oil.
B. (S)-4-Isopropyl-N-propanoyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione (2). An oven-dried three-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged with (S)-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione (1) (8.08 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The necks are fitted with a low temperature thermometer (with an adaptor), nitrogen line, and a rubber septum. The flask is flushed with nitrogen, and charged with anhydrous THF (33 mL, Note 10). The resulting solution is cooled in a liquid nitrogen-ethyl acetate bath (-83 °C bath temperature; -78 °C internal temperature) and treated with a 1.52 M solution of n-BuLi in hexanes (36.5 mL, 55.5 mmol, 1.1 equiv; Note 11), added dropwise by syringe over 25 min so as to keep the internal temperature below -70 °C. After 15 min, the heterogeneous solution is treated with propanoyl chloride (5.50 mL, 63.5 mmol, 1.3 equiv; Note 12), added dropwise by syringe over 10 min, keeping the internal temperature below -70 °C. The resulting clear solution is stirred for 5 min, the cold bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred for 1.5 h. During this time, the solution becomes dark yellow/orange, and solids precipitate. The reaction mixture is cooled with an ice-water bath and then quenched with a saturated solution of NH4Cl (20 mL) and water (50 mL). The resulting mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over 5 g of MgSO4 then vacuum filtered (water aspirator, ~20 mmHg) through a cotton plug into a side-arm flask. Concentration of the filtrate with a rotary evaporator gives a bright yellow oil. This residue is loaded on a column (6.5-cm diameter glass column) of silica gel (ca 150 g; Note 13) and eluted with 1:1 CH2Cl2/hexanes (2 L, Note 14) to afford 8.38-8.63 g (77-79% yield) of (S)-4-isopropyl-N-propanoyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione (2).
A. 2,3,5,6,8,9-Hexahydrodiimidazo[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrazine (1). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a fritted-gas dispersion tube (initially closed) connected to a nitrogen manifold , and a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen (N2) inlet tube connected to the nitrogen manifold. The nitrogen manifold exit line is routed through two fritted-gas washing bottles charged with 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in order to scrub H2S evolved in the reaction. The reaction flask is charged with 10.0 g (83.2 mmol) of dithiooxamide and 50 mL of absolute ethanol . A solution of 12.2 g (83.2 mmol) of triethylenetetramine in 50 mL of absolute ethanol is introduced into the reaction flask in one portion via the addition funnel. The magnetically stirred reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 hr under nitrogen with evolution of H2S and ammonia (NH3). The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and residual H2S and NH3 are purged from the reaction mixture for 3 hr by entrainment with nitrogen, which is bubbled through the submerged fritted-gas dispersion tube. Ethanol is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue is dissolved in 150 mL of chloroform (CHCl3). The insoluble material is removed by gravity filtration through a glass wool plug that is inserted in a short-stem glass funnel. CHCl3 is then removed by rotary evaporation to give 14.0 g of crude product. This solid is taken up in 50 mL of boiling toluene , insoluble impurities are removed by filtration through a glass wool plug, and the flask and funnel are rinsed with a second 50-mL aliquot of boiling toluene. The combined filtrates are concentrated to afford 13.4 g of light yellow crystalline product. Sublimation of this material (0.05 mm, 110°C) affords 10.4 g (76%) of pure (>99%) white product.
The crude product is diluted with 50 ml. of ether, washed with 10 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution then with 10 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. 1-Cyclohexenylacetonitrile is collected as a colorless liquid, b.p. 74–75°/4 mm. (110–112°/25 mm.), n25D 1.4769, in a yield of 92–110 g. (76–91%).
The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered with suction through a large Büchner funnel. The residue is washed with alcohol. The filtrate which will be in two layers, is extracted twice with benzene, first with 270 cc. and then with 130 cc. The combined benzene extracts are dried with sodium sulfate and then filtered into a distilling flask. The benzene is distilled from a water bath, and then the diallylcyanamide is distilled under reduced pressure. It boils at 105–110°/18 mm.; at 128–133°/57 mm.; and at 140–145°/90 mm. There is a small residue of higher-boiling material. The yield of diallylcyanamide, boiling over a 5° range, is 90–97 g. (52–56 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the calcium cyanamide).
C. Enrichment of (2S)-2-methyl-2-(2-propen-1-yl)-cyclohexanone via (2E)-2-[(2S)-2-methyl-2-(2-propenyl)cyclohexylidene]-hydrazinecarboxamide. Into a 250-mL, pear-shaped flask is added 5.58 g of sodium acetate (68.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 8.38 g of semicarbazide hydrochloride (74.8 mmol, 1.10 equiv), 75 mL of purified water, and a large magnetic stir bar. The solution is stirred until all of the solids dissolved. At this point, 10.34 g of neat 2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone (68.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added via syringe. When the addition is complete, a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold is attached and the mixture is heated to 60 °C for 14 h. The thick slurry is vacuum filtered (water aspirator) directly through filter paper on a porcelain Büchner funnel and rinsed with water (2 × 20 mL). The white solid is dried for 30 min on the funnel, transferred to a 250-mL round-bottomed flask, which then is immersed in a 50 °C water bath. The white solid is dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) until a constant mass of 12.2 g (58.3 mmol, 86% yield) is achieved (about 8 h). At this point, the semicarbazone is found to have 90–91% ee (measured by reverting to the ketone, Note 20).
C. Benzoylcholine iodide. A solution of 194 g. (0.70 mole) of 2-iodoethyl benzoate in 200 ml. of dry acetone is treated with 270 ml. of a 19.5% solution of trimethylamine in acetone in a 1-l. Pyrex reagent bottle which is closed with a tightly fitting rubber stopper wired in place. The solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours, and at the end of this time the quaternary salt is separated by filtration with suction, washed with 200 ml. of dry acetone, and air-dried. The weight of the quaternary iodide melting with decomposition at 247° is 200–210 g. (85–90%).
Dec-9-enyl bromide (4). To an oven-dried, one-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, magnetic stirrer and a condenser are added 8.06 g (27.1 mmol) of the Barton ester (3) , 100 mL of methylene chloride, and 3 mL (30.0 mmol) of bromotrichloromethane. The reaction mixture is photolyzed with a 250W tungsten lamp under reflux for 30 min. The color of the reaction mixture changes from bright yellow to pale yellow. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by flash column chromatography (hexanes) until all the bromide 4 is eluted, affording 5.81 g of dec-9-enyl bromide (98%).
Stirring is continued for 2 hours at room temperature, and methanol is added until a clear solution is obtained (ca. 10 ml. of methanol is required, and some heat is generated). When the solution has cooled, it is washed successively with 200 ml. of aqueous 2 N potassium carbonate and 200 ml. of water. The aqueous phases are combined, washed with three 100-ml. portions of chloroform, and discarded. The organic phases are combined, dried over sodium sulfate, and decolorized with activated carbon. Concentration of the chloroform solution obtained provides three crops of pale yellow crystals, which are washed with 30% hexane in chloroform and dried for 2 hours at 80°/0.1 mm, yielding 22.3–25.4 g. (72–81%) of 3-(2-phenyl-1,3-dithian-2-yl)-1H-indole, m.p. 167–169°. This material requires no further purification for use in Parts D or E.
The crude acid is dissolved in 100 ml. of boiling dimethylformamide, and 100 ml. of hot glacial acetic acid is added. Water is added to the hot solution until it becomes cloudy, and then just enough dimethylformamide is added to render the solution clear again. It is cooled to 5°, and the resulting acid collected by filtration and washed with glacial acetic acid. Upon drying, 10–11.5 g. (32–38%) of 5-formyl-4-phenanthroic acid, melting at 272–276°, is obtained.
Six hundred and seventy-five grams (6 moles) of 80% lactic acid, 300 ml. of benzene, and 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid are placed in a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask having a capillary ebullition tube in one neck. The flask is attached to a Vigreux column 75 cm. in length, having at its top a trap of the Dean and Stark type, preferably the Barrett modification carrying a stopcock, and a reflux condenser. The mixture is refluxed, and the aqueous layer is withdrawn from the trap until liberation of water becomes slow or until noticeable darkening of the material begins. Then 1394 g. (1635 ml. or 24 moles) of allyl alcohol is added, and refluxing and removal of water are continued until production of water ceases. The acid catalyst is then neutralized with anhydrous sodium acetate (18 g.), and the fractionating column is replaced by a short distillation head leading to a 3-l. round-bottomed receiving flask cooled in salt and ice. The liquid is distilled rapidly under diminished pressure, first at the water pump and finally at a pressure of about 5 mm. A viscous residue (about 130 g.) containing inorganic salts is discarded. The distillate is fractionated through the column used in the first steps. The trap at the reflux condenser is replaced with a still head arranged for controlled partial take-off. The first fraction is the benzene-allyl alcohol binary azeotrope, which distils at 76.8° and contains 17.4% of the alcohol. Frequently a small amount of allyl ether is obtained at 94–95°. Allyl alcohol is then distilled at 97° until most of it is removed and the temperature of the residue in the pot reaches about 120°. The pressure is reduced to about 50 mm. while the remainder of the alcohol is removed. Finally the allyl lactate is distilled at 56–60°/8 mm.. It amounts to 693–710 g. (89–91%).
A. p-Carbomethoxylbenzamide. A 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask that is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (round, 5 x 15 mm), a reflux condenser and Argon bubbler is charged with the following order of the reagents: methyl p-cyanobenzoate (5.0 g, 31 mmol), toluene (9.5 mL), Wilkinson's catalyst (145 mg, 0.16 mmol, 0.5 mol%), and acetaldoxime (9.2 g, 9.5 mL, 156 mmol, 5.0 equiv). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with an oil bath (bath temperature 130 ºC) for 4 h and then is allowed to cool down to room temperature. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure on rotary evaporator (20-30 mmHg, bath temperature 40-45 ºC). Water (20 mL) is added to the concentrate and the mixture is heated with an oil bath (90~100 °C bath temperature) under air for 1 h and cooled down to room temperature. The resulting mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel. The solid product is washed with water (40 ml). The solid is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask and dried under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) to afford 5.1 g (92%) of p-carbomethoxylbenzamide as a white solid.
The product is dissolved in 800 ml. of hot 95% ethanol, 15.5 g. of activated carbon is added, and the mixture is swirled periodically while it is allowed to cool for 1 hour. The activated carbon is removed by filtration with suction through a bed of filter aid, the filter cake is washed with 50 ml. of 95% ethanol, and the combined filtrates are evaporated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 225 ml. of boiling water, and the hot solution is decanted through glass wool placed in a filter funnel. The filtrate is cooled to 0°, the product is collected by filtration with suction, washed with a small amount of cold water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 50°, yielding 25.6–28.0 g. (62.9–68.8%) of 4-formylbenzenesulfonamide, m.p. 117–118°.
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, condenser, and a nitrogen gas inlet is charged with 50.0 g (0.270 mol) of 4-bromobenzaldehyde , 34.6 g (0.284 mol, 1.05 equiv) of benzeneboronic acid , and 485 mL of 1-propanol under a nitrogen purge. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min, allowing the solids to dissolve. The resulting solution is treated with 0.182 g (0.811 mmol, 0.003 equiv) of palladium acetate , 0.638 g (2.43 mmol, 0.009 equiv) of triphenylphosphine , 162 mL of 2 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) (0.324 mol, 1.20 equiv), 95.0 mL of deionized water and heated to reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere.
In a clean, dry, 500-ml. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 250-ml. separatory funnel, and a reflux condenser, the upper end of which is protected by a calcium chloride drying tube, is placed 40 g. (0.62 gram atom) of powdered zinc.
B. 2-Ethoxypyrrolin-5-one. The flask containing 51–54 g. (0.25–0.26 mole) of succinimide silver salt is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a heating mantle, and reflux condenser bearing a silica gel drying tube. The solid is suspended in 295 ml. of dry chloroform, and 51.4 g. (26.4 ml., 0.330 mole) of ethyl iodide is added in one portion. The flask is covered with aluminum foil, and the mixture is stirred vigorously and heated under reflux for 48 hours. The mixture is cooled, the silver iodide is removed by vacuum filtration through Celite, and the filter cake is washed well with dry chloroform. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a mixture of a dark liquid and a white solid identified as succinimide. Anhydrous diethyl ether is added to dissolve the liquid, and the resulting suspension is filtered through a plug of glass wool, separating 7.7–11.5 g. of succinimide. The ether is removed from the filtrate by rotary evaporation at aspirator pressure, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure with a short-path distillation apparatus. The product is collected at 74–82° (0.01 mm.) as a faintly yellow oil which crystallizes in the freezer. The yield is 11.5–16.7 g. (32–46% based on sodium ethoxide in Part A) and.
The solution is stirred slowly and ca. 25 ml. of 2N cupric chloride solution is added slowly. The blue-green color of the cupric chloride is rapidly discharged and a brick red coloration occurs, followed by the precipitation of voluminous bright red crystals of the cuprous chelate of 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene. The pH is adjusted to 5–6 by the addition of 5N ammonium hydroxide. Addition of 25 ml. of the cupric chloride solution followed by neutralization of the generated hydrochloric acid with 5N ammonium hydroxide is repeated five times. The precipitate is collected by filtration and the filtrate is again treated with 25-ml. portions of cupric chloride solution and 5N ammonium hydroxide. The procedure is repeated until the filtrate is clear red at pH 3–4 and returns to a cloudy green at pH 6 with no further formation of precipitate.
C. 2-Methyl-2-nitrosopropane. A solution of sodium hypobromite is prepared by adding, dropwise and with stirring over a 5-minute period, 57.5 g. (18.5 ml., 0.360 mole) of bromine to a solution of 36.0 g. (0.900 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 225 ml. of water. The resulting yellow solution, contained in a 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an acetone–dry ice cooling bath, is cooled to −20°. A suspension of 26.7 g. (0.300 mole) of N-tert-butylhydroxylamine in 50 ml. of water is added to the reaction flask, with continuous stirring, as rapidly as possible without allowing the temperature of the reaction mixture to exceed 0°. The reaction solution is again cooled to −20° before the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 4 hours while the reaction mixture warms to room temperature. The solid product, the nitroso dimer which has separated, is collected on a sintered glass funnel, pulverized, and washed with 1 l. of water. The residual solid is dried at room temperature under reduced pressure (10–15 mm.), leaving 19.6–22.2 g. (75–85%) of the 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane dimer, m.p. 80–81°. The product is sufficiently pure to be stored for use as a free radical trapping reagent.
There is obtained by filtration 5.0–5.5 g. (48–53%) of yellow chloro-p-quinone of m.p. 53–55°; ether extraction of the filtrate yields a further 1.0 g., which brings the total yield to 58–63% and. Crystallization from a small volume of aqueous ethanol (85–90%) raises the melting point to 55–56°.
A. (Ethylthio)methanol (1). An oven-dried 250-mL, 3-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. Paraformaldehyde (5.58 g, 0.186 mol, 1.07 equiv) and ethanethiol (12.8 mL, 10.7 g, 0.173 mol, 1.0 equiv) are added to the flask. The mixture is stirred gently (avoid splashing) and cooled in an ice-water bath to 4 °C. A 25% solution of NaOMe in MeOH (0.07 mL, 0.002 equiv) is added through one of the septa via a 100 μL syringe over 1 min. The temperature rises to 33 °C over 3 min, then cools to 13 °C over 5 min. The solids completely dissolve. The ice-water bath is removed and the solution is stirred at 13-16 °C for 15 min. The pale yellow (ethylthio)methanol (1) is used immediately in the next step.
A mixture of 132.5 g. (1.05 moles) of sodium sulfite, 99.5 g. (0.5 mole) of bis-4-chlorobutyl ether, and 450 ml. of water is placed in a creased 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with an efficient sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser. The third neck of the flask is closed with a stopper, and the mixture is heated and stirred vigorously under reflux until the ether has dissolved. At the end of this time, heating is discontinued, and 60 ml. of concentrated C.P. hydrochloric acid is cautiously added to the solution. The mixture is then boiled with stirring until sulfur dioxide is no longer evolved. Solid barium chloride dihydrate (or a 10% aqueous solution of this salt) is added to the hot solution until all sulfate has been precipitated; then the barium sulfate is removed by suction filtration through a layer of filter aid.
B. Dimethyl 3-methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylate. One liter of methanol is added cautiously with occasional shaking to 276 g. (2.00 moles) of 3-methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride (n25D 1.4946–1.4955;) and 5 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid in a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer, a condenser, and a dropping funnel. Refluxing starts after about two-thirds of the methanol has been added. The remainder is added at a rate that maintains vigorous boiling. The solution is refluxed for 30–40 hours with the pot temperature increasing from 67° to 68°. The mixture is cooled to 15°, and methanol and water are removed by distillation under reduced pressure at temperatures below 15°, using a large receiver cooled with a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and acetone. When the pressure goes below 1 mm., the temperature is increased to 50° until the distillation is completed. One liter of methanol is added to the residue, and the solution is heated under reflux for an additional 30–40 hours, during which time the pot temperature increases from 67° to 67.5°. The solution is cooled to 15°, 1.7 g. of finely powdered anhydrous sodium carbonate is added to neutralize the p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the methanol and water are removed as before. Crude dimethyl 3-methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylate is distilled rapidly at 65–85°/1 mm. through a 30-cm. Vigreux column. The ester can be purified by redistillation through a 13-mm. × 1.2-m. Nester still, with the main fraction boiling at 134–137°/25 mm.; weight 297–338 g. (81–92%); n25D 1.4624–1.4630.
The reaction mixture is cooled to about 0° with an ice-salt bath; then with gentle stirring a solution of 15 g. of potassium hydroxide in 50 ml. of 50% aqueous ethanol is added dropwise very slowly from the dropping funnel. After the addition of 0.5–1 ml. of the alkaline solution a brisk evolution of nitrogen commences and the temperature rises. The rate of addition is adjusted so that the temperature is maintained at 10–20°. The addition of the alkali requires about 2 hours, during which the nitroso compound gradually disappears. The orange-yellow solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, then 2N hydrochloric acid (about 50 ml.) is added until the solution is acidic to litmus paper.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, reflux condenser, and a 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a rubber septum is charged with 49 g (0.75 mol) of zinc dust, 1.0 mL (0.012 mol) of 1,2-dibromoethane , 2.0 mL (0.016 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane , and 500 mL of ethyl acetate. After the mixture is stirred for 15 min at room temperature, it is heated to reflux by means of an oil bath and 38.7 mL (0.500 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride is added dropwise through the addition funnel. The reaction is highly exothermic. At the end of the addition (1 hr), a large part of the zinc is consumed. The resulting grey suspension is stirred for an additional 15 min. Acetyl chloride, 35.7 mL (0.502 mol) , is then added dropwise ( CAUTION : Note 3 ) through the addition funnel with care taken to maintain vigorous stirring of the reaction mixture. After completion of the addition, the resulting mixture becomes clear and no zinc remains. Heating is maintained for an additional 15 min, and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting clear solution is poured into a 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (ca. 200 mL) and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (ca. 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (ca. 200 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residual yellow oil is distilled under reduced pressure to give 24.1 g (76% yield) of methyl methanethiosulfonate as a colorless liquid, bp 80-83°C/0.5 mm.
The cystine is precipitated from the clear solution by adding a filtered saturated solution of 900–1000 g. of crystallized sodium acetate until the Congo red reaction is negative. After standing five to six hours, the cystine is filtered and washed twice with 100–200 cc. portions of hot, distilled water to remove the last traces of tyrosine. By this method the typical colorless hexagonal plates of cystine are obtained. The yield is 100–106 g. (5.0–5.3 per cent of the weight of the starting material).
The resulting ε-aminocaproic acid hydrochloride is converted to the free acid by a procedure similar to that used in the preparation of dl-alanine (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 21). The hydrochloride is dissolved in 1 l. of water in a 1.5-l. beaker and treated successively with 50 g. of powdered litharge, 25 g. of powdered litharge, 5 g. of freshly precipitated lead hydroxide, 25 g. of powdered silver oxide, and, finally, hydrogen sulfide. During this procedure, the original volume is maintained by the addition of small amounts of water.
The entire contents of the flask are then transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker and stirred with a mechanical stirrer for about 30 minutes or long enough to break up all the lumps. The finely divided material is filtered on a Büchner funnel and washed with 200 ml. of cold water. The above process of washing, stirring, and filtering is repeated twice. The product is then transferred to a 1.5-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of methanol is added and heated to boiling in order to effect solution. The hot solution is filtered through a heated Büchner funnel and allowed to cool slowly. When the solution has cooled to 20°, the product is collected on a filter and air-dried. This first crop consists of yellow needles which melt at 74–77° and weigh 215–225 g. The filtrate is evaporated to 100 ml. and cooled. An additional 25–30 g. of solid separates. Both crops are again washed with cold water and recrystallized from 500 ml. of hot methanol. The first crop from this second crystallization weighs 210–218 g. and melts at 77–78°. Evaporation of the filtrate to 100 ml. and cooling yield an additional 15–18 g. of acetate which is purified by recrystallization from methanol; about 12 to 15 g. of product is obtained. The combined yield of pale yellow crystals which melt at 77–78° amounts to 222–233 g. (78–82%).
The dry calcium malonate is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask with sufficient (750–1000 cc.) alcohol-free ether to make a paste which can be stirred. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the well-stirred salt is treated with 1 cc. of 12 N hydrochloric acid for each gram of salt. After the acid has been added slowly through a dropping funnel, the solution is transferred to a continuous extractor and extracted with ether until no more malonic acid is obtained. The product, as obtained from the undried ether solution by concentration, filtration, and drying in the air, melts at 130° or higher and is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The yield is 415–440 g. (75–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
E. 3-Benzylindole. A suspension of 1.34 g. (0.0100 mole) of anhydrous copper(II) chloride and 2.72 g. (0.0200 mole) of anhydrous zinc chloride in 150 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is prepared in a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a condenser connected to a nitrogen source. This mixture is stirred at room temperature and maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere while 3.04 g, (0.0800 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride is added cautiously in small portions. The resulting exothermic reaction gives a black precipitate, which is stirred at room temperature for 45 minutes before 1.55 g. (0.00508 mole) of 3-(2-phenyl-1,3-dithian-2-yl)-1H-indole is added. Stirring is continued as the mixture is refluxed for 1 hour, cooled to room temperature, and quenched by careful dropwise addition of 10 ml. of water. The resulting slurry is diluted with 100 ml. of dichloromethane and filtered to remove inorganic salts, which are washed by digesting with three 50-ml. portions of refluxing dichloromethane. The combined filtrates are then washed with a solution of 4.0 g. (0.012 mole) of mercury(II) acetate in 100 ml. of water, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, leaving about 1.1 g. of a yellow crystalline residue. Bulb-to-bulb distillation at 145–155° (0.1 mm.) yields 0.74–0.85 g. (72–82%) of practically pure 3-benzylindole as pale yellow crystals, m.p. 102–105°.
A. o-Nitrophenylazide. A mixture of 28 g. (0.2 mole) of o-nitroaniline, 80 ml. of water, and 45 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is placed in a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The stirrer is started, and the flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath until the temperature of the mixture is 0–5°. After this temperature has been reached, the amine hydrochloride is diazotized by adding dropwise a solution of 14.5 g. of reagent grade sodium nitrite in 50 ml. of water. Stirring is then continued for 1 hour at 0–5°. The yellow-green solution is filtered from traces of insoluble impurities and poured into a 2-l. beaker surrounded by an ice bath. With stirring, a solution of 13 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium azide in 50 ml. of water is added. Almost immediately the o-nitrophenylazide begins to precipitate as a light-cream to colorless solid, which is collected on a Büchner funnel after the nitrogen evolution has ceased (15–20 minutes). The yield of o-nitrophenylazide, m.p. 52–55°, is 31–32 g. (94–97%). This crude product can be used for the preparation of benzofurazan oxide in Part B.
In a 2-l. two-necked round-bottomed flask having a capillary ebullator tube in one neck are placed 371 g. (5 moles) of n-butyl alcohol, 861 g. (10 moles) of methyl acrylate, 20 g. of hydroquinone, and 10 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid. The flask is attached to an all-glass fractionating column, preferably one without packing such as the Vigreux type, and the solution is heated to boiling in an oil bath. The column is operated under total reflux until the temperature of the vapors at the still head falls to 62–63°, which is the boiling point of the methanol-methyl acrylate azeotrope. This azeotrope is then distilled as rapidly as it is formed, the temperature at the still head not being allowed to exceed 65°. When the production of methanol has become very slow (6–10 hours), the excess methyl acrylate is distilled, and the butyl acrylate is then distilled, preferably at 10–20 mm. It boils at 39°/10 mm., 84–86°/101–102 mm., and at about 145° at atmospheric pressure. The yield is 500–600 g. (78–94%).
A 200-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 11.6 g. (0.100 mole) of hexanoic acid and 10 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. After 46.9 g. (28.8 ml., 0.394 mole) of thionyl chloride is added to the solution, an efficient reflux condenser with an attached drying tube is fitted to the flask. The solution is stirred and heated with an oil bath at 65° for 30 minutes. The flask is removed from the oil bath and cooled to room temperature. To the reaction mixture are added successively 21.4 g. (0.120 mole) of finely powdered N-bromosuccinimide, 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, and 7 drops of 48% hydrogen bromide. The flask is heated at 70° for 10 minutes, before the temperature of the bath is increased to 85°, until the color of the reaction becomes light yellow (ca. 1.5 hours;. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the carbon tetrachloride and excess thionyl chloride are removed under reduced pressure. The residue is suction filtered, the solid is washed several times with carbon tetrachloride (total 20 ml.) and the combined filtrate collected in a 50-ml. flask. The solvent is removed from the solution as before, and the residue is distilled into a dry ice-cooled receiver (short-path column), giving, after a small forerun, 16.1–17.1 g. (76–80%) of 2-bromohexanoyl chloride, b.p. 44–47° (1.5 mm.) as a clear, slightly yellow oil, n22D 1.4707. This material is of sufficient purity for most synthetic purposes.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 500 cc. (400 g., 8.7 moles) of absolute alcohol which has been saturated in the cold with hydrochloric acid gas, 870 cc. (680 g., 14.8 moles) of 96 per cent alcohol, and 70 g. (1.03 moles) of methyleneaminoacetonitrile. This mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for three hours. During the refluxing, ammonium chloride separates. After the reaction is complete, the hot alcohol solution is filtered with suction and the filtrate cooled, thus allowing the glycine ester hydrochloride to separate in fine white needles. The product is filtered with suction, sucked as dry as possible on the filter, and then allowed to dry in the air. The yield is about 110 g. The alcohol from the filtrate is distilled until about one-third of its volume is left; it is cooled again, when a second crop of crystals is obtained. The total yield of product, m.p. 142–143°, varies from 125 to 129 g. (87–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a very pure product is desired, the material may be re-crystallized from absolute alcohol.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a separatory funnel and a reflux condenser, is placed 145 g. (1.83 moles) of dry pyridine; 231 g. (1.83 moles) of methyl sulfate is added dropwise through the separatory funnel. After the addition of the methyl sulfate the flask is heated in a boiling water bath for two hours to complete the reaction.
The reaction mixture is cooled to −15° ± 3° and 116 g. (1.16 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added with vigorous stirring over approximately 1 hour at such a rate that the reaction temperature is maintained at −15°. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over a 4-hour period and stirred for another 4 hours at room temperature. The precipitate is removed by suction filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 30–40°. The residual oil is dissolved in benzene and washed with water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation. Further distillation under reduced pressure yields 30–32 g. (66–70%) of methyl nitroacetate, b.p. 80–82° (8 mm.), 111–113° (25 mm.).
A. 3-(1-Propyl)-2-pyrazolin-5-one. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser is charged with 23.7 g. (0.150 mole) of ethyl 3-oxohexanoate, 250 ml. of ethanol, and 9.8 g. (0.17 mole) of 85% aqueous hydrazine hydrate. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours at 0° and 2 hours at reflux, then reduced in volume to 50–100 ml. on a rotary evaporator. The resulting suspension is cooled to 0–5° and suction filtered, giving 14–16 g. (77–83%) of 3-(1-propyl)-2-pyrazolin-5-one as colorless crystals, m.p. 204–206°, which are dried for 1–2 hours over anhydrous calcium chloride and used without further purification.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and two reflux condensers are placed 68 g. (0.68 mole) of succinic anhydride (p. 560) and 350 g. (4.5 moles) of dry, thiophene-free benzene. The stirrer is started, and 200 g. (1.5 moles) of powdered, anhydrous aluminum chloride is added all at once. Hydrogen chloride is evolved and the mixture becomes hot. It is heated in an oil bath and refluxed, with continued stirring, for half an hour. The flask is then surrounded by cold water, and 300 cc. of water is slowly added from a dropping funnel inserted in the top of one of the condensers. The excess benzene is removed by steam distillation, and the hot solution is at once poured into a 2-l. beaker. After the mixture is cold the liquid is decanted from the precipitated solid and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 20 cc. is required); 5 to 15 g. of benzoylpropionic acid separates and is filtered. The residual suspension in the beaker is boiled for five hours with 1.5 l. of water containing 360 g. of commercial soda ash; the resulting solution is filtered with suction, the filter cake washed with hot water, and the filtrate acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid; about 300 cc. is required. The precipitated benzoylpropionic acid is filtered and washed with hot water. After drying for a day it weighs 95–100 g. (77–82 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 111–113°.
To 70 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 1-l. short-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and immersed in an ice-water bath is added, with vigorous stirring, 10 g. (0.145 mole) of solid sodium nitrite in small portions. The addition is made at such a rate that only a very small amount of nitrogen oxide is evolved. When solution is complete, 20 g. (0.145 mole) of salicylic acid is added in small portions with stirring; about fifteen minutes is required. The mixture is stirred at 20° until all the solid is in solution. The mixture should then be light red to brown in color, very viscous, and quite homogeneous. It is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and, when the temperature reaches 0°, 5 cc. (0.065 mole) of a 35–40 per cent solution of formaldehyde (formalin) (see Note 1 on p. 378) is slowly added with extremely vigorous stirring, at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 5°. The reaction is complete a few minutes after all the formaldehyde has been added. About 100 g. of finely crushed ice is then added, followed by 500 cc. of ice water; the stirring should be vigorous during the addition. The contents of the flask are stirred until the aurin tricarboxylic acid has disintegrated into small pieces.
A. Ethyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate. A tared 2-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient reflux condenser connected through a calcium chloride drying tube to a gas-absorption trap, and is set up on a steam bath in a hood. In the flask are placed 250 g. (1.5 moles) of ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and 444 g. (266 ml., 3.3 moles) of sulfuryl chloride. The mixture is warmed on the steam bath (gently at first) until gas is no longer evolved (about 1 hour). Then 50 ml. of sulfuryl chloride is added to the reaction flask, and the warming is continued until gas is no longer evolved. This entire chlorination procedure requires about 1.5 hours. The excess sulfuryl chloride is then removed by attaching a water pump through an empty safety flask to the reaction flask and warming on the steam bath until no evidence of vapor can be detected above the white solid in the reaction flask. The residue in the flask should weigh about 350 g.. Recrystallization from a mixture of 600 ml. of ethanol and 140 ml. of water gives 315–334 g. (83–88%) of ethyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate hydrate melting at 110–114° with decomposition.
C. Diamantane. A 500-ml., three-necked flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, a drying tube, a magnetic stirring bar, and a dropping funnel is charged with 28 g. (0.11 mole) of fresh aluminum bromide and 100 ml. of cyclohexane. The apparatus is flushed with hydrogen bromide gas. When the aluminum bromide has dissolved, 100 g. (0.532 mole) of hydrogenated Binor-S is added dropwise to the rapidly stirred solution, and the reaction mixture refluxes for a short time without external heat. The course of the reaction is monitored by GC until no starting material remains. Occasionally, an additional 5 g. portion of aluminum bromide, and application of external heat are needed to complete the reaction. The total reaction time is about 2–3 hours. The hot cyclohexane layer is carefully decanted, and the aluminum bromide layer is extracted with five 200-ml. portions of hot cyclohexane. Diethyl ether (400 ml.) is added to the cooled cyclohexane extracts, and the combined solvent fractions are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent leaves a semi-solid residue, which is partially dissolved in about 100 ml. of pentane. The undissolved white solid, diamantane, is collected by suction filtration. Additional diamantane is obtained by concentrating the pentane solution to a small volume and collecting the solid that precipitates. The total amount of diamantane obtained, after drying, is 60–62 g. (60–62%), m.p. 240–241° (closed tube). This product is sufficiently pure for most purposes, but it may be purified further by recrystallization from pentane, giving white crystals, m.p. 244.0–245.4°.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of sodium is dissolved in 600 cc. of absolute alcohol. About one hour is required for the addition of the sodium, and another hour for its complete solution. Toward the end of the reaction the flask may be heated with a small smoky flame. While the sodium is being dissolved, the following materials are weighed in dry, stoppered containers: 58 g. (1 mole) of dry acetone, 150 g. (1.03 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261), and 160 g. (1.1 moles) of ethyl oxalate.
The reaction mixture of benzoin, prepared by the method described on p. 94, is permitted to stand until the next day, when it is filtered, washed with water but is not dried or purified. In a 30-cm. evaporating dish 500 g. (12.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 115 g. (0.76 mole) of sodium bromate (or 125 g. of potassium bromate) are dissolved in 880 cc. of water. The moist benzoin (450–460 g.) is added in portions to this solution and the mixture is stirred, preferably with a mechanical stirrer, while heated on the steam bath. As heating continues the mixture thickens and more water is added from time to time. A total of 750–800 cc. is needed. The heating and stirring are continued for about five to six hours or until a test portion is completely or almost completely soluble in water.
A. 2,4-Dibromo-3-pentanone (1). A three-necked, 250-ml. flask is fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Bromine (160 g., 1.00 mole) is added rapidly to a stirred solution of 45 g. (0.52 mole) of 3-pentanone and 1 ml. of phosphorus tribromide maintained between −10° and 0° with an acetone–dry ice bath in an efficient hood. Toward the end of the reaction very large amounts of hydrogen bromide are evolved, and the rate of addition must be controlled to allow the hood to exhaust the gas. Alternatively, a gas trap may be used. Depending on the efficiency of the hood, the addition should take 20–40 minutes. The flask is then evacuated with a water pump, removing dissolved hydrogen bromide, and the reaction mixture is immediately fractionally distilled through a 40-cm. column packed with glass helices (or, more quickly, with a Dufton column)2 under reduced pressure. The dibromoketone 1, a mixture of dl- and meso-isomers,3 distills at 67–82° (10 mm.), and 91 g. (72%) of product is collected as a colorless liquid.
The solid is suspended in 300 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide at 15°. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, and the solid is filtered by suction and washed with water until the filtrates are no longer alkaline. The procedure is repeated, but stirring is continued for 0.75–1.0 hour. After the solid has been filtered by suction, washed, and pressed as dry as possible, it is dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide for 12–16 hours.
B. (−)-Dimenthyl (1S,2S)-cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is equipped with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a rubber septum, and a three-way stopcock with a nitrogen inlet. The air in the system is replaced with dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 180 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and cooled with an ice bath; 74.1 mL of a 1.7 M hexane solution of butyllithium (126 mmol) is added. This solution is stirred while 21.3 mL (126 mmol) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine is added dropwise with a syringe through the septum over a 10-min period. The resulting solution of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP) is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice–methanol bath and stirred. A solution of 23.7 g (60 mmol) of (−)-dimenthyl succinate in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is then added dropwise through the addition funnel over a 1-hr period. The wall of the funnel is rinsed with 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and the rinse is added to the solution. The resulting yellow solution of succinate dianion is stirred for 1 hr. To the solution is added dropwise 3.9 mL (60 mmol) of bromochloromethane with a syringe through the septum over a 10-min period. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr, 2.2 mL (24 mmol) of isobutyraldehyde is added dropwise to quench any unreacted anions. After being stirred for an additional 30 min, the reaction mixture is poured into 250 mL of ice-cooled 1 N hydrochloric acid and the product is extracted 3 times with 150 mL of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with 250 mL of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is chromatographed on 700 g of silica gel packed in a 9.5-cm-diameter column using a mixture of ether and hexane (1 : 18) as eluant. The appropriate fractions are collected and concentrated to give 11.5 g (47%) of (−)-dimenthyl (1S,2S)-cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate as colorless crystals. Analysis by GC indicates a diastereomeric ratio of 96 : 4. Recrystallization of this material from 25 mL of methanol affords 9–10 g (38–40%) of optically pure product, mp 95–96°C.
Gaseous boron trifluoride (136 g., 2.00 moles) from a cylinder mounted on a scale is bubbled into the stirred, cooled reaction mixture. The first mole is passed in rather quickly (in about 10 minutes). When approximately 1 mole has been absorbed, copious white fumes begin to appear at the exit, and the rate of flow is diminished so that it takes about 1 hour to pass in the second mole; even at this slow rate, there is considerable fuming at the exit. After all the boron trifluoride has been introduced, the mixture is allowed to stand in the cooling bath under a slow stream of nitrogen for 1.5 hours. The mixture is swirled, and the suspended product is separated from the supernatant liquid by means of a medium-porosity, sintered-glass Buchner funnel. The gooey solid remaining in the flask is transferred to the funnel with the aid of two 50-ml. portions of nitromethane. The solid on the funnel, nitronium tetrafluoroborate, is washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of nitromethane and two 100-ml. portions of methylene chloride. In order to protect the salt from atmospheric moisture during the washing procedure, suction is always stopped while the salt is still moist. The moist salt is transferred to a round-bottomed flask and dried by evaporating the solvent. At the end of the procedure the flask can be gently heated to 40–50°. The yield of colorless nitronium tetrafluoroborate is 85–106 g. (64–80%),,. It is stored in a wide-mouthed polyolefin bottle with a screw cap. The edge of the cap is sealed with paraffin wax after it is screwed on.
A. 2-Bromoallylhexaminium bromide. A 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer,2 a dropping funnel, and a condenser is charged with a solution of 154 g. (1.10 moles) of hexamethylenetetramine in 1250 ml. of chloroform. The solution is stirred and heated under reflux while 200 g. (1.00 mole) of 2,3-dibromopropene is added dropwise over a period of 1 hour. Precipitation of the product is noted soon after the first addition of 2,3-dibromopropene. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred under reflux for 3 hours and allowed to stand overnight. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the salt is collected by suction filtration. After air-drying, the crude yellow 2-bromoallylhexaminium bromide weighs 292–308 g. (86–91%) and melts at 183–186°.
A solution of 90 g. of potassium hydroxide in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol is prepared in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The solution is cooled somewhat, and the stilbene dibromide is added in several portions. The mixture is then refluxed for 24 hours in an oil bath. The hot mixture is poured into 750 ml. of cold water, and the product is removed by filtration and washed with 50 ml. of water. The crude diphenylacetylene is dried over calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator for 18 hours at room temperature. The chunky, pale yellow crystals melt at 58–60° and weight 33.7–37.8 g. By recrystallization of this product from 50 ml. of 95% ethanol there is obtained 29.2–30.5 g. (66–69% based on the stilbene) of pure diphenylacetylene, which forms white needles melting at 60–61°.
A solution of 20.8 g. (0.1 mole) of benzalacetophenone (p. 78) in 150 cc. of c.p. ethyl acetate is placed in the reaction bottle of the catalytic reduction apparatus (p. 61), and 0.2 g. of platinum oxide catalyst (p. 463) is added. The apparatus is evacuated, then filled with hydrogen, and the mixture shaken with hydrogen until 0.1 mole has been absorbed. The time required is usually about fifteen to twenty-five minutes. The platinum is filtered off and the solvent removed from the filtrate by distillation. The benzylacetophenone is recrystallized from about 25 cc. of alcohol and melts at 72–73°. The yield is 17–20 g. (81–95 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper and a gas inlet connected to the argon/vacuum line is flame-dried and back-filled with argon. This flask is charged with the MoCl4(THF)2 complex (53.30 g, 140 mmol), THF (300 mL) and tin shot (107.3 g, 0.904 mol), and the resulting suspension is stirred for 30 min, resulting in a slight exotherm (a temperature of approximately 30 °C is reached). Stirring is then discontinued to allow the remaining tin to settle. Upon gentle manual swirling, leaving the metallic tin at the bottom of the flask, the supernatant suspension (liquid and all solids except metallic tin) is decanted, the solid material is collected by filtration under argon, the product is carefully rinsed with pentane (100 mL) and dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar), affording MoCl3(THF)3 as an orange solid (51.2 g, 88%).
After the reaction mixture has been cooled, the excess phosphorus oxychloride is distilled under reduced pressure (80–100 mm.) (0.5–1.0 hour). Near the end of the distillation the product begins to sublime into the still head. The residual dark-brown oil is poured with stirring into an 800-ml. beaker containing 280–300 g. of crushed ice and. The volume of the ice-water mixture is brought to 600 ml. and allowed to stand at 5° overnight. The crude light-brown product is filtered by suction and washed with water.
1. Preparation of (R,R)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine·(L)-Tartrate To a solution of a 1/1 mixture of d,l- and meso-2,2'-bispyrrolidine (67.0 g, 479 mmol) in H2O (240 mL) is added (L)-(+)-tartaric acid (36.0 g, 240 mmol, 0.5 equiv) and acetic acid (27.4 mL, 479 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The mixture is heated to 90 °C and the homogenous solution is allowed to cool to room temperature slowly before it is placed in an ice bath. After the solid precipitates, the mixture is kept in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is then filtered and is washed with ice-cold water (20 mL). The mother liquor is saved for the recovery of the (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine. The collected solid is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 °C for 2 h to give 31.6 g of a light yellow powder. This solid is dissolved in hot water (90 mL) and the solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature before it is placed in an ice bath for 1 h. The precipitate is filtered and the solid is washed with ice-cold water (10 mL). The solid is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 °C for 2 h to give 23.0 g of white crystals. This recrystallization process is repeated using water (50 mL) to give 21.4 g (62% based on isomer content) of (R,R)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine·(L)-tartrate as white prismatic crystals.
The solution is poured, with stirring, into 3 l. of ice water. The mixture of 4- and 6-nitroacetotoluides precipitates as a creamcolored solid which is collected on a large Büchner funnel. After thorough washing with four 500-ml. portions of ice water, the precipitate is partly dried by suction. The moist product is then placed in a steam-distillation apparatus, covered with 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and heated until the mixture boils. The acetotoluides are rapidly hydrolyzed, and the solution becomes dark red. Steam is then introduced, and the distillation is thus continued until 36 l. of distillate has been collected and. The 2-amino-3-nitrotoluene, which separates as bright orange needles when the distillate is cooled, is collected on a large Büchner funnel. The dried product amounts to 75–84 g. (49–55%), m.p. 92–94°. The product may be further purified by a second steam distillation. Ten grams of the amine is distilled from 150 ml. of water, and 3 l. of distillate is collected, yielding 8.7 g. of 2-amino-3-nitrotoluene, m.p. 95–96° (cor.).
The reaction mixture is then poured into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 ml. of vigorously stirred water, 10 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel. The reaction vessel and Erlenmeyer flask are rinsed with water, and the rinsings are also poured into the funnel. Alkali-insoluble impurities are removed by washing the basic aqueous phase with four 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether, which are combined and backextracted with two 50-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide. The combined aqueous layers are then put into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, cooled in an ice bath, and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to a Congo red end point. During acidification the clear yellow basic solution becomes cloudy white. This milky suspension is stirred without cooling for 3 minutes then extracted with 200 ml. of ether and two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether layers are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of solvent with a rotary evaporator provides a residue that is vacuum dried, yielding 3.58–3.60 g. (97–98%) of a slightly yellow solid, m.p. 121.5–126°. One recrystallization from 20 ml. of benzene gives almost white crystals which are vacuum dried, affording 3.21–3.29 g. (87–88%) of 4-hydroxy-3-ethoxybenzaldehyde, m.p. 125.5–127° and.
(5S)-(5-O-tert-Butyldimethylsiloxymethyl)furan-2(5H)-one. An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 35.5 g (0.27 mol) of 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde and 250 mL of methanol . The flask is cooled in an ice bath during the portionwise addition of 96 g (0.28 mol) of methyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate, and the resultant mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 0°C. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue is refluxed for 30 min with a mixture of ether:petroleum ether (3:7, 100 mL). The process is repeated three times, the combined extracts are filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to yield a colorless oil. The oil is purified by silica chromatography [ 1 kg of silica, 8.5-cm × 43-cm column eluting with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether (3:7)] to yield 39.5 g (78%) of methyl (4S)-4,5-O-isopropylidenepent-(2Z)-enoate , and 4.8 g (10%) of the corresponding trans-isomer, both as colorless oils,.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed, short-necked flask 47 g. (0.25 mole) of the crude azlactone of α-acetaminocinnamic acid is dissolved by boiling with a mixture of 450 cc. of acetone and 175 cc. of water. Hydrolysis is completed by boiling under reflux for four hours. Most of the acetone is then removed by distillation at ordinary pressure on a steam bath. The residual solution is diluted with 400 cc. of water, heated to boiling for five minutes to ensure complete solution of the acetamino acid, and filtered and. A small amount of undissolved material (0.2–0.5 g.) which remains on the filter is washed with 50–75 cc. of boiling water. Any crystals which separate from the filtrate are redissolved by heating, after which the solution is boiled for five minutes with 10 g. of Norite and filtered with the aid of gentle suction while still almost at the boiling point. The Norite is washed thoroughly on the funnel with two to four 50-cc. portions of boiling water to remove the crystals which separate during the filtration, and the washings are added to the main filtrate. After standing in a refrigerator overnight the colorless, crystalline needles are collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 150–200 cc. of ice-cold water, and dried for several hours at 90–100°. The yield is 41–46 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount) of practically pure material, m.p. 191–192°.
A 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer and, condenser, and dropping funnel is mounted in the hood, and in it are placed 20 g. (0.061 mole) of potassium anthraquinone-α-sulfonate (p. 539), 500 cc. of water, and 85 cc. (1 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution is heated to boiling and stirred, while a solution of 20 g. (0.19 mole) of sodium chlorate in 100 cc. of water is added dropwise over a period of three hours. The mixture is refluxed very slowly for an additional hour before the precipitated α-chloroanthraquinone is collected by suction filtration and washed free from acid with hot water (about 350 cc.). After drying in vacuo at 100°, the bright yellow product melts at 158–160° (corr.) and weighs 14.6–14.7 g. (97–98 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
When the addition is completed, the heat source is removed and the dark-colored contents are allowed to cool until another 0.25 mole of ethereal chloramine has been prepared and is ready for use; a wait of 1.5–2 hours between chloramine additions is convenient but not essential to the success of the experiment. The cooled reaction mixture is then reheated to 150°, and the process is repeated. This sequence is repeated until a total of four 0.25-mole portions of chloramine are added.
(A) In Pyrex 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed a mixture of 500 g. (3.4 moles) of phthalic anhydride and 400 g. (444 cc., 6.6. moles) of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia. The flask is fitted with an air condenser not less than 10 mm. in diameter and is then slowly heated with a free flame until the mixture is in a state of quiet fusion at a temperature of about 300°. It requires about one hour before all the water has gone and about one and one-half to two hours before the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 300° and the mixture is a homogeneous melt. It is advisable, during the heating, to shake the flask occasionally; some material sublimes into the condenser and must be pushed down with a glass rod. The hot reaction mixture is now poured out into a crock, covered with a paper to prevent loss by sublimation, and allowed to cool. The product is practically pure without further treatment, and melts at 232–235°. The yield is 470–480 g. (95–97 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A mixture of 1.5 l. of water and 624 g. (6.00 moles) of sodium bisulfite in a 5-l. beaker equipped with a mechanical stirrer is stirred until solution is complete. Benzaldehyde (636 g., 6.00 moles) is added and the mixture is stirred for 20 minutes, during which time a slurry of the benzaldehyde-bisulfite addition product is formed. A 25% aqueous solution of dimethylamine (1100 g.) containing 275 g. (6.13 moles) of the amine is run in, and stirring is continued as most of the addition compound dissolves. The beaker is immersed in an ice bath, and 294 g. (6.00 moles) of sodium cyanide (Caution! Toxic) is added over a period of 20–25 minutes.
3-Phenyl-2-propynenitrile . A 1-L, two-necked flask, fitted with a 100-mL addition funnel, 2-cm stir bar, and a thermometer, is charged with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (240 mL), acetonitrile (CH3CN) (80 mL), and water (4.3 mL,). To this rapidly stirring solution is added cuprous cyanide (CuCN) (43.0 g, 0.48 mol,), sodium iodide (2.4 g, 0.016 mol), and phenylacetylene (17.6 mL, 0.16 mol,). Chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) (60.6 mL, 0.48 mol,) is added to the reaction mixture dropwise over a 2-hr period, via the addition funnel, and the reaction mixture is heated at 50°C (internal temperature) for 72 hr. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of water is added, and it is extracted with ether (5 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate (500 mL), brine (500 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate , and concentrated. The crude residue is dissolved in pentane (100 mL), filtered through a silica plug (50 gm), and the precipitate is washed with pentane (2 × 100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated and reduced pressure distillation yields 9.8 g (48% yield) of 3-phenyl-2-propynenitrile as a yellow solid at room temperature.
After all the cyclohexylbromopropene has been run in, heating is continued for about two hours, the mixture is cooled and 500 cc. of ether is added. This mixture is poured on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice in a 5-l. flask and then acidified with 280 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ether layer is separated, dried over calcium chloride, and transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) for distillation. The ether is distilled at ordinary pressure and then the cyclohexylpropine under diminished pressure. The product boiling up to 115°/20 mm. is collected and fractionated. The cyclohexylpropine boils at 58–63°/20 mm. The higher-boiling material is chiefly unchanged cyclohexylbromopropene which may be used again in a subsequent run. The yield of cyclohexylpropine is 80 g. (66 per cent of the theoretical amount not taking into consideration the recovered cyclohexylbromopropene which amounts to about 10 g.). The pure compound boils at 61–63°/24 mm.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a 90-cm. air-cooled condenser are placed 288 g. (3 moles) of freshly distilled furfural, 460 g. (425 ml., 4.5 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 294 g. (3 moles) of dry, pulverized, freshly fused potassium acetate. The ingredients are mixed thoroughly, stirring is started, and the flask is heated in an oil bath at 150° (bath temperature) for 4 hours, without interruption. It is well to make provision for acetic acid vapor which escapes through the air condenser.
In a 5-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a solution containing 200 g. (1.8 moles) of resorcinol, 1 kg. (9.9 moles) of potassium acid carbonate, and 2 l. of water is heated slowly on a steam bath for four hours. The flask is then placed over a flame and refluxed vigorously for thirty minutes; a rapid stream of carbon dioxide is passed through the solution during this heating process.
A. Preparation of an ether solution of lithium dibutylcuprate. A 500-mL flask with a side arm is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and three-way stopcock, on top of which is attached a rubber balloon, D. A Pt-100-thermometer, E, is inserted into the flask through the septum. The air in the flask is replaced by dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 10.8 g (0.0525 mol) of cuprous bromide–dimethyl sulfide complex and 100 mL of ether, then immersed in a bath at −50°C; 0.10 mol of butyllithium, ca. 1.6 M solution in hexane, is added dropwise, with stirring, via a syringe inserted through the rubber septum, at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed −20°C.
C. 3-Benzyl-3-methylpentanenitrile. Sixty-seven grams (1 mole) of potassium hydroxide (85%) is dissolved by heating in 360 ml. of ethylene glycol and is added to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask containing 155 g. (0.6 mole) of ethyl 3-benzyl-2-cyano-3-methylpentanoate (above). A condenser is attached with a rubber stopper, and the mixture is heated under gentle reflux for 3 hours. The resulting two-phase mixture is cooled, diluted with 350 ml. of water, and extracted with three portions of ether (250 ml., 100 ml., 100 ml.). The three extracts are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, then filtered through a layer of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The combined extracts are flash-distilled at atmospheric pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask to remove the ether. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to furnish 102–105 g. (91–93%) of nitrile, b.p. 150–160°/11 mm. (bath temperature, 190–200°), nD25 1.5111–1.5128 and.
C. The hydroxy stannane is dissolved in 100 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride in a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The yellow solution is stirred at 0°C and diisopropylethylamine (i-Pr2NEt) (8.80 mL, 50.5 mmol) is added, followed by chloromethyl methyl ether (2.90 mL, 38.2 mmol). After 5 hr the reaction is quenched with 100 mL of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether . The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is distilled by rotary evaporation. The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel. Elution with hexane followed by EtOAc-hexane (1:9) affords 4.1-5 g (40-49% yield) of (S,E)-1-methoxymethyl)-1-tributylstannyl-2-butene.
The flask is then cooled in an ice bath and the reaction mixture hydrolyzed by the addition of 200 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid with vigorous stirring during the addition. The acid layer is drawn off and the benzene solution extracted twice with 50-ml. portions of 5% sulfuric acid. The benzene solution is washed once with 25 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution, then with 25 ml. of 5% sulfuric acid, and finally with two 25-ml. portions of water. The combined acid solutions are extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether and benzene solutions are dried with 5 g. of magnesium sulfate or Drierite. The solution is filtered, the solvent removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure from a steam bath, and the residue fractionated under reduced pressure. The ester is collected at 151–154°/11–12 mm. (128–132°/5–7 mm.). The total yield is 59–62 g. (61–64%).
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 85.0 g. (0.62 mole) of nicotinamide-1-oxide (p. 704) and 180.0 g. (0.86 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride, and the solids are thoroughly mixed. Two hundred and forty-three milliliters of phosphorus oxychloride is added slowly with shaking. A spiral condenser provided with a drying tube is attached to the flask which is then placed in an oil bath preheated to 60–70°. The temperature is slowly (20–25 minutes) raised to 100°, during which time the reaction mixture is occasionally shaken. In the range 100–105° the evolution of hydrogen chloride gas increases, and a spontaneous, vigorous refluxing of the phosphorus oxychloride begins. The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath, and the rate of refluxing is controlled by the application of an ice-water bath. After the vigorous reaction has subsided (about 5 minutes) the oil bath is replaced, and heating under reflux is continued at 115–120° for 1.5 hours.
A 2-l. three-necked flask, supported in an oil bath, is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an inlet tube which reaches almost to the bottom of the flask. In it is placed 696 g. (4 moles) of decamethylene glycol, and, after the oil bath is heated to 95–100°, a rapid stream of dry hydrogen bromide is introduced, with stirring. When the mixture becomes saturated with the gas, as shown by vigorous fuming at the open neck of the flask, the temperature of the oil bath is raised to 135° and a slow current of hydrogen bromide is passed in for 6 hours.
D. Base and butyllithium addition. Ten minutes after the addition of lithium tetramethylpiperidide to the main reaction is complete, the cold (ca. −70°C) solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide and lithium ethoxide is added (via a double-ended needle) over a 15 to 20-min period, while maintaining the reaction mixture temperature below −65°C. Five minutes after the addition is complete, the dry ice-acetone cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm. When the internal temperature of the solution has reached −20°C (after about 15 min), the reaction mixture is again cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath,. When the internal reaction temperature has reached −70°C or below, 308 mL (0.400 mol) of 1.3 M sec-butyllithium in cyclohexane is added via syringe over a 30 to 40-min period so that the internal temperature is maintained below −60°C. Five minutes after the addition is complete, the dry ice-acetone cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm. After the internal temperature has gradually reached ca. −10°C, the reaction mixture is warmed to 20°C with a ~25°C water bath. A solution of butyllithium (80 mL, 0.200 mol) in hexanes is then added using a syringe pump over a 30 to 40-min period while the internal temperature is maintained between 20–25°C,. The reaction mixture is then allowed to stir for 30 min at room temperature.
B. Cyclododecyl mercaptan. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and nitrogen inlet and outlet stopcocks are placed 25.8 g (0.10 mol) of 1,4-dithiaspiro[4.11]hexadecane and 300 mL of ether, freshly distilled from sodium. The mixture is purged with nitrogen, cooled to 0°C with an ice bath, and 125 mL (0.30 mol, 2.4 M in hexane) of butyllithium is added by syringe, under a slow flow of nitrogen. The light-yellow mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred overnight with nitrogen stopcocks closed. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C and 50 mL of water is added slowly and very carefully. The resulting light brown solution is poured into 200 mL of water in a separatory funnel and, after shaking, the organic layer is separated. The solution is dried over MgSO4, concentrated (aspirator), and distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column at 103–108°C (1 mm) to give 17.2–17.9 g (86–90%) of pure cyclododecyl mercaptan,. A small forerun, bp < 95°C, (ca. 2 mL) is discarded.
The crude product is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser. Methanol (1.4 L), water (0.4 L), and 66.6 g of potassium hydroxide are added and the mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, the organic solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual aqueous alkaline suspension is filtered through a suction filter. The solid is washed carefully with 250 mL of water. In a separatory funnel the combined aqueous layers are washed three times with a total of 300 mL of methylene chloride. The aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask, immersed in an ice bath, and acidified to pH 2.5 by cautious addition of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer, and the pH is controlled carefully to avoid over-acidification. The clear solution is again poured into a separatory funnel, saturated with sodium chloride, and extracted with five 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The pH of the aqueous layer is controlled and readjusted to pH 2.5 by addition of 6 N hydrochloric acid, if necessary. The combined organic layers are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in a rotary evaporator without heating. The yellow syrupy residue is dried carefully at room temperature under reduced pressure (10−3 mm) to yield 9.7–12.4 g (61–78%) (76 mmol; 63%) of (R)-(+)-3-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoic acid in 86–92% optical purity, [α]D20 +32° to +37° (99% chloroform, c 0.11) [lit.2 [α]D20 +40.5° (chloroform, c 0.0063); lit.3 [α]D20 +40.14° (chloroform, c 1.22)].
In a 1-l. flask fitted with a stirrer and reflux condenser, 50.5 g. (0.25 mole) of technical 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene is dissolved in 250 cc. of alcohol; the hydrazine solution is added, and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for an hour. Most of the product separates during the first ten minutes; it is cooled well, filtered, and washed, once with 50 cc. of warm alcohol (60°) to remove unchanged halide and then with 50 cc. of hot water. The solid weighs 30 g. and melts at 190–192° with evolution of gas; it is pure enough for most purposes. By distilling half the alcohol from the filtrate a less pure second crop is obtained; this is recrystallized from n-butyl alcohol (30 cc. per g.). The total yield is 40–42 g. (81–85 per cent of the theoretical amount)–(Note 10).
A. 2,5-Undecanedione. A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a short gas inlet tube, and an efficient reflux condenser fitted with a potassium hydroxide drying tube is charged with 26.8 g (0.1 mol) of 3-benzyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methyl-1,3-thiazolium chloride, 500 mL of absolute ethanol, 77.2 g (1.1 mol) of 3-buten-2-one, 60.6 g (0.6 mol) of triethylamine, and 114.2 g (1.0 mol) of heptanal. A slow stream of nitrogen is started and the mixture is stirred and heated in an oil bath at 80°C. After 16 hr the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Then 500 mL of chloroform is added to the residue and the mixture is washed with 200 mL of dilute hydrochloric acid (5%), 200 mL of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and, finally, with two 200-mL portions of water. After the solution is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the chloroform is distilled off and the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure through a 30-cm Vigreux column. The main fraction is collected at 80–82°C/0.3 mm. The yield is 130–138 g (71–75% based on heptanal) of a colorless distillate, which solidifies on standing at room temperature, mp 33–34°C and.
Glutaric Acid.—A mixture of 125 g. (0.37 mole) of the above product, 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 125 cc. of water is heated in a 1-l. flask under a reflux condenser until it becomes homogeneous (six to eight hours). The contents of the flask are then evaporated to dryness, and the residual glutaric acid is transferred to a 100-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under diminished pressure. The fraction boiling at 185–195° /10 mm. is collected. It is moistened with water and heated gently, after which it is dried at 30°. On recrystallization from benzene, it separates in colorless needles, m.p. 96–97°. The yield is 38–40 g. (76–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 3,3'-Dimethoxybiphenyl. In a 1.5-l. beaker are placed 400 ml. of water and 31 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This solution is heated to boiling, the flame is removed, and 40 g. (0.16 mole) of o-dianisidine is added. The hot mixture is stirred for about 3 minutes, until only a small amount of solid remains. The beaker is then placed in an ice-salt mixture and its contents are stirred mechanically until the temperature has dropped to about 15°. At this point 35 ml. more of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. When the temperature of the mixture has fallen to 10–13°, a solution of 23.3 g. (0.33 mole) of 97% sodium nitrite (or an equivalent amount of sodium nitrite of higher or lower purity) in 50 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel in the course of 10–15 minutes. The contents of the beaker are then stirred for 15–20 minutes at 5–10°, and finally filtered rapidly with suction from an appreciable amount of dark material.
An intimate mixture of 150 g. (0.64 mole) of dry ε-benzoylaminocaproic acid (p. 76) and 26.4 g. (0.85 gram atom) of dry red phosphorus is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask provided with a separatory funnel, an air-cooled condenser connected through a calcium chloride tube to a water trap, and a mechanical stirrer. The reaction flask is surrounded by an ice-salt mixture, the stirrer started, and 408 g. (131 cc., 2.55 moles) of dry bromine added dropwise from the separatory funnel. When all the bromine has been added the cooling bath is removed. The mixture is warmed slowly at first and finally heated on a steam bath, with stirring, until the bromine vapors have practically disappeared. The hot mixture is poured slowly into 400 cc. of water in a 1-l. beaker with hand stirring. The viscous acid bromide reacts with the water with the evolution of heat, and the solid acid is formed. The lumps are pulverized, the mixture is replaced in the original reaction flask, and the whole is treated with a slow stream of sulfur dioxide to remove excess bromine. The solid product is filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed with three 50-cc. portions of water, and air-dried. The crude material is dissolved in 250 cc. of hot 95 per cent alcohol, filtered, and poured with stirring into 1 l. of cold water. After filtering and air-drying, 130–180 g. (64–89 per cent of the calculated amount) of acid melting at 162–165° is obtained.
B. 7-Chloro-2-methyl-1,4-dihydro-2H-isoquinolin-3-one (3). A three-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 3-cm magnetic stir bar, a temperature probe, a 50-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser with a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for a minimum of 15 min and charged with 50 mL of Eaton's reagent. 2-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-methylacetamide (10.0 g, 54.5 mmol) is charged in portions, resulting in an exotherm from 23 Â¿C to 29 Â¿C. Paraformaldehyde (1.98 g, 65.3 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is added and the reaction mixture is heated at 80 Â¿C with a heating mantle for 2 h to afford a brown solution [Caution! The reaction is exothermic], at which point HPLC analysis indicates complete consumption of starting material 2. The reaction mixture is cooled to 5 Â¿C with an ice bath and water (50 mL) is added through the addition funnel over 30 min while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 Â¿C. Caution! The addition of water is exothermic. Isopropyl acetate (IPAc) (50 mL) is added and the mixture is cooled to 5 Â¿C with an ice bath. The pH of the mixture is adjusted to 8Â¿8.5 using 19M NaOH solution (~48-49 mL) while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 Â¿C with an ice bath. Caution! The addition of NaOH is exothermic. The solid precipitate is filtered off with a BÂ¿chner funnel. The filter cake is washed with IPAc (10 mL). The filtrate mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with IPAc (50 mL) and the organic phases are combined. The combined organic phases are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 Â¿C, 30 mmHg) to afford a brown residue. The residue is dissolved in EtOAc (50 mL) and charged on a column (5 Â¿20 cm) of 200 g of silica gel. The column is eluted with 1 L of EtOAc and fraction collection (50-mL fractions) is begun after 500 mL of solvent is eluted. Elution is continued with 1 L of 10% MeOH/EtOAc and the desired product is obtained in fractions 12-22, which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 Â¿C, 30 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil. The oil is dried under vacuum (30 mmHg) at ambient temperature (20Â¿25 Â¿C) for a minimum of 24 h to afford 9.00-9.07 g (85%) of a light yellow solid.
At the end of this time, the solution is cooled to room temperature and 240 g. (6 moles) of solid u.s.p. sodium hydroxide is slowly dissolved in it. When solution is complete, the reaction mixture is again heated on the steam bath under a hood. When the temperature reaches 60–70°, evolution of ammonia begins and becomes more vigorous with rise in temperature. Most of the ammonia is evolved in forty-five minutes, but the solution is heated for at least three hours, and the last traces of ammonia are removed by bubbling steam through the hot solution for forty-five to sixty minutes more.
A. 5,6-Dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one. In a 500-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are combined 43 g. (0.50 mole) of vinylacetic acid, 30 g. (1 mole as CH2O) of paraformaldehyde, 3 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 125 ml. of glacial acetic acid. This mixture is refluxed gently for 3 hours, then cooled to room temperature and swirled while 16 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate is added. Acetic acid is removed at 50–55° on a rotary evaporator, 100 ml. of water is added, and the flask is fitted with a two-necked adapter, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath, and the solution is brought to pH 8 with aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide, which is added dropwise and with stirring at a rate such that the temperature remains below 5°. The resulting solution is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and extracted with four 300-ml. portions of dichloromethane. After being washed with one 150-ml. portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. Removal of dichloromethane with a rotary evaporator leaves a mobile yellow oil, which is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 12.3 g. (25.1%) of 5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, b.p. 114–117° (18–19 mm.).
The light-yellow oil is dissolved in 60 ml. of 30% anhydrous diethyl ether in pentane and treated with 2 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and 0.5 g. of decolorizing carbon. The mixture is swirled for a few minutes, allowed to settle, and filtered by gravity through three sheets of fine filter paper into a 100-ml., round-bottomed flask with a 14/20 joint. The filter is washed with 10 ml. of pentane, and the flask is sealed by wiring on a 14-mm. serum cap. The flask is placed on a cork ring, lowered into an insulated container (large Dewar bottle, styrofoam box, etc.) half filled with dry ice, and cooled slowly to −78°. When recrystallization is complete, a nitrogen supply is connected to the flask via a syringe needle; the supernatant liquid is then withdrawn by syringe and replaced with 50 ml. of pentane, previously cooled to −78°.
The crude dibenzalacetone may be recrystallized from hot ethyl acetate, using 100 cc. of solvent for each 40 g. of material. The recovery in this purification is about 80 per cent; the purified product melts at 110–111°.
A. tert-Butylcarbonic diethylphosphoric anhydride. A 500-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a gas-inlet tube is dried in an oven, flushed with nitrogen, and allowed to cool while an atmosphere of nitrogen is maintained in the reaction vessel. To the flask are added successively 250 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 13.9 g. (0.124 mole) of alcohol-free potassium tert-butoxide. After the mixture has been stirred for 10 min. under a nitrogen atmosphere to complete dissolution of the salt, the solution is cooled in an ice bath, and a slow stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide is bubbled through the cold solution for 1.5 hours with continuous stirring. While cooling, stirring, and the flow of carbon dioxide are maintained, a solution of 20.6 g. (0.120 mole) of pure diethyl phosphorochloridate in 50 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise to the reaction mixture, and the cold reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes under a carbon dioxide atmosphere. After the solvent has been removed from the reaction mixture by concentration with a rotary evaporator at room temperature, the residual mixture of anhydride and potassium chloride is diluted with 300 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and centrifuged, separating the insoluble salt. The salt is successively suspended in two 150-ml. portions of anhydrous ether and centrifuged to remove any remaining ether soluble product. The combined ether solutions are concentrated at room temperature with a rotary evaporator, leaving 25–28 g. (84–91%) of the crude anhydride, as a colorless to pale yellow liquid, sufficiently pure for use in the next step.
The mixture is then heated on a steam bath, gently at first, and then at full heat for two hours. After cooling, it is filtered by suction. The mixture of the organic disulfide and the sodium chloride is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and stirred thoroughly with 500 cc. of water to remove the sodium chloride. It is then filtered by suction and the crystalline residue is washed on the filter with 100 cc. of alcohol to remove any o-chloronitrobenzene. The product melting at 192–195° weighs 180–210 g. (58–66 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. o-Tolylzinc chloride. An oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a dropping funnel, a rubber septum inlet, and an outlet connected to a mercury bubbler is flushed with nitrogen, immersed in a dry-ice bath kept at −78°C, and charged with 26.2 g (120 mmol) of o-iodotoluene and 60 mL of ether. To this solution is added dropwise, with stirring, 154 mL (1.56 M, 240 mmol) of a hexane solution of tert-butyllithium. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at −78°C, it is warmed to room temperature, stirred for 1 hr, and concentrated under diminished pressure using a water aspirator (ca. 15 mm) until most of the volatile solvents are evaporated. To this concentrate is added 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and. The mixture is, in turn, added to 16.3 g (120 mmol) of dry zinc chloride and 60 mL of tetrahydrofuran placed in a similarly equipped, 500-mL flask using a 16-gauge double-ended needle under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen; the resulting mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature.
The crude product is dissolved in absolute ethanol (10 ml. per gram of material), and a saturated solution of mercuric chloride (1 g. per 5 g. of crude olefin) in absolute ethanol is added. The precipitate is filtered and washed with absolute ethanol. The filtrate is concentrated to half of its original volume and cooled in an ice bath. The yield of olefin is 42–60 g. (39–56%), m.p. 71–72°.
When the furnace is fully heated, boiling water is placed beneath the round-bottomed flask and cold water passed through the condenser. Acetone is now dropped in at the rate of 3–4 cc. per minute. About one-half the acetone should be recovered as distillate in cylinder B. Ketene, admixed with methane, carbon monoxide, and ethylene, passes into the reaction flasks in 25–29 per cent yields of the theoretical amount. The flow may be interrupted at will by checking the acetone flow.
B. 4,4'-Bis(chloromethyl)-2,2'-bipyridine . Into a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed 5.22 g (15.9 mmol) of 4,4'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2,2'-bipyridine , 15.1 g (63.6 mmol) of hexachloroethane (Cl3CCCl3, Note 8) and 9.65 g (63.6 mmol) of cesium fluoride (CsF, Note 9) at 25°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. Acetonitrile (260 mL) is added and the heterogeneous reaction mixture is stirred at 60°C for ≈3.5 hr (or until TLC indicates that all TMS starting material is consumed). After the mixture is cooled to 25°C, it is poured into a separatory funnel containing ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and water (H2O, ≈100 mL each). The product is extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 mL); the combined organic fractions are shaken with brine (≈200 mL) and dried over Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration on a rotary evaporator, followed by flash chromatography using deactivated silica gel (60% EtOAc: 40% hexanes), gives 3.67 g (91%) of the chloride as a white solid.
In a 1-l. flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer are placed 200 g. (1.27 moles) of o-chloronitrobenzene and 300 g. of clean dry sand. The mixture is heated in an oil bath to 215–225°, and then 200 g. of copper bronze is slowly added, the addition requiring about 1.2 hours. The temperature is kept at 215–225° for 1.5 hours longer, the stirring being continued throughout. The mixture is poured while hot into a beaker containing 300–500 g. of sand and is then stirred until small clumps are formed; upon cooling, these are broken up in a mortar. The mixture is boiled 10 minutes with two 1.5-l. portions of ethanol and removed by filtration each time. The filtrates are cooled in an ice bath, and the 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl is collected on a filter. A second crop is obtained by concentrating the filtrate. The product is dissolved in hot ethanol, and the solution is treated with Norit, filtered, and cooled in an ice bath. The solid is recrystallized from hot ethanol and is obtained as pure, yellow crystals melting at 123.5–124.5° (cor). The yield is 80–95 g. (52–61%).
2-Nitroaniline (13.8 g., 0.10 mole) is dissolved in a hot solution of 75 ml. of 96% sulfuric acid, 100 ml. of phosphoric acid (density 1.7), and 50 ml. of water in a 1-l. beaker. A stirrer and a thermometer are introduced into the mixture, and the beaker is immersed in an ice bath. A solution of 8.3 g. (0.12 mole) of sodium nitrite in 25 ml. of water is added dropwise to the well-stirred solution at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at 10–15°. Excess nitrite is destroyed by adding sulfamic acid in small portions. The mixture is cooled to −10° in an ice-salt bath, and about 50 ml. of liquid sulfur dioxide is poured into the well-stirred reaction. The product is immediately poured onto a mixture of 55.6 g. (0.20 mole) of FeSO4·7 H2O and 1 g. of defatted copper powder in a wide 2-l. beaker. Nitrogen and excess sulfur dioxide bubble off with much foaming.
To obtain the pure 2,6-isomer, the following procedure may be followed. A 200-ml. flask, equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, dried in an oven, and flushed with nitrogen, is charged with 2.59 g. (0.0479 mole) of sodium methoxide and stoppered with a rubber septum. A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the remainder of the reaction. Using a hypodermic syringe, 90 ml. of ether (freshly distilled from lithium aluminum hydride) is added to the flask. The resulting suspension is cooled with an ice bath before a mixture of the crude, distilled, alkylated product (about 21–23 g.) and 3.74 g. (0.0505 mole) of ethyl formate is added with a hypodermic syringe. The mixture is stirred for 10 minutes with ice-bath cooling. The bath is then removed and stirring is continued for an additional 50 minutes. The resulting yellow suspension is treated with 300 ml. of water and extracted with 250 ml. of ether. The ethereal extract is washed with 100 ml. of aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 16.2–17.3 g. (overall yield 42–45%) of pure 2-benzyl-6-methylcyclohexanone as a colorless liquid, b.p. 95–100° (0.3 mm.), nD25 1.5299–1.5328.
A mixture of 156.6 g. (159 ml., 1.98 moles) of pyridine, 239.9 g. (224 ml., 2.35 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 35.1 g. (0.39 mole) of vacuum-dried alanine and is heated with stirring on the steam bath for 6 hours after solution is complete. The excess pyridine and acetic anhydride, and the acetic acid, are removed at reduced pressure. The residue is distilled through a 15-cm. column, packed with glass helices, to give 41.5–47.5 g. of crude product, boiling at 110–125°/3 mm. Refractionation gives 41–45 g. (81–88%) of 3-acetamido-2-butanone; b.p. 102–106°/2 mm.; nD25 1.4558–1.4561.
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and separatory funnel, is placed 400 cc. of absolute alcohol. Through the condenser tube is added slowly 23 g. (1 gram atom) of clean sodium cut into thin slices. The completion of the reaction is hastened by heating the flask on a steam bath. When the sodium has dissolved completely, 143 g. (1.1 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 235) is introduced slowly. After the mechanical stirrer is started, 123 g. (1 mole) of ethyl chloroacetate is added slowly over a period of an hour, and the reaction mixture is refluxed for five to six hours. At this point the reaction mixture should no longer give an alkaline reaction with moist litmus.
The oil bath is removed, and, with the stirring maintained, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature by running cold water over the flask. Then 150 ml. of water is added to dissolve the reaction mass, and both layers of the mixture are transferred to a separatory funnel. An ice-cold solution of 25 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is shaken vigorously. The ester layer is separated and washed with 200 ml. of water; it is then shaken with successive 200-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases, after which it is washed with 200 ml. of water. The bicarbonate solution is separated and extracted with 100 ml. of ether. The ether extract, after washing with 50 ml. of water, is combined with the ester layer and the resulting ethereal solution dried with 40 g. of calcium chloride. The ether is removed by distillation from a water bath, and the excess ethyl benzoate is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The recovered ester, b.p. 80–83°/8 mm., amounts to 475–490 g. After the ester is removed the temperature of the oil bath is slowly raised to 180–185° while the system is maintained under 8 mm. pressure. A small amount of liquid distilling higher than the ester is thus removed. When no more distillate comes over at this temperature, the remaining oil, while still warm, is poured into a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and allowed to crystallize. This crude dibenzoylmethane weighs 92–108 g. and is usually brown. It is recrystallized by dissolving in 150 ml. of hot methanol, adding 1 g. of Norit, filtering, and cooling the filtrate to 0°. The yield of yellow crystals of dibenzoylmethane, m.p. 77–78°, thus obtained is 70–80 g. (62–71% based on the acetophenone).
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient water condenser are placed 148 g. (2 moles) of ethyl formate (b.p. 52–53°) and 150 ml. of 95% ethanol. One hundred and twenty grams (2 moles) of 85% hydrazine hydrate is added cautiously to this solution with shaking over a period of 10 minutes. After the reaction has subsided, the solution is refluxed on a steam bath for 18 hours. The bulk of the water and ethanol is now removed by evaporation under reduced pressure until the volume in the flask is about 150 ml. The resulting syrup, crude formhydrazide, is heated under atmospheric pressure for 3 hours, during which time the temperature of the bath is raised from 150° to 200°. After cooling to about 100°, the oil is taken up in 50 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 5 g. of Norite is added. The filtered solution is then diluted with 75 ml. of ether and placed in an icebox to cool. The crystalline product is filtered, washed with 50 ml. of 1:2 ethanol-ether, and dried. The yield of aminotriazole, melting at 77–78°, is 55–60 g. (65–71%). If a purer product is desired, the crude, washed material may be recrystallized, using 2 ml. of warm 95% ethanol per gram of compound followed by the addition of 2.5 ml. of ether, and chilling. The melting point of the purified product is 81–82°.
A. N-(2-Propenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (2).A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, internal thermometer and powder funnel is charged with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (97.2 g, 0.51 mol). The powder funnel is replaced with a rubber septum connected to a positive pressure of argon and an oil bubbler. The apparatus is flushed with argon and charged with tetrahydrofuran (THF) (400 mL,) and pyridine (42.9 mL, 0.53 mol). The flask is placed in an ice bath and, after the reaction mixture has cooled to ca. 10°C, allylamine (37.5 mL, 0.50 mol) is added portion-wise by syringe over ca. 40 min (exothermic) maintaining the internal temperature below 15°C. The ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. After 4 hr the rubber septum is removed and the mixture is treated with 75 mL of a 2M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. After another 4 hr, the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate (EtOAc). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (50 mL) and dried with magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the presence of activated carbon (4 g). The solution is filtered through a plug of silica gel (diameter: 5 cm; height: 3 cm) and the cake is washed with EtOAc (300 mL). The combined filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is recrystallized from 275 mL of 30% EtOAc/hexanes to afford 65 g (62%) of allyl tosylamide as a first crop. A second crop of 27 g (26%, 88% in total) is obtained from the mother liquor.
The slightly moist aldehyde is distilled under diminished pressure from an oil bath, by means of a 1-l. Claisen flask. A small amount of water comes over first, then the thermometer rises rapidly to the boiling point of the aldehyde (180°/22 mm.). In changing receivers between the water fraction and the aldehyde, care should be taken to keep the side arm of the distilling flask warm; otherwise, on starting the distillation again, the aldehyde will solidify in the side arm and cause trouble. It is advisable not to collect the very last portion of the distillate with the main portion, as the former is frequently quite red. This is best added to crude material from another run. The main distillate is dissolved in 100 cc. of alcohol in a 2-l. beaker, then 1 l. of water is gradually added with vigorous mechanical stirring to prevent lumping. The aldehyde separates, and is filtered with suction. The product, when dry, weighs 125–130 g. (56–59 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 73°.
A 2-l., four-necked flask equipped with a sealed, Teflon-paddle stirrer, a mercury thermometer, a gas-inlet tube, and a dropping funnel is charged with 1.2 l. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 50 g. (7.1 g.-atoms) of lithium pieces under an atmosphere of prepurified nitrogen. The stirred mixture is cooled to −20° with an acetone dry-ice bath and a mixture of 100 g. (1.00 mole) of methyl methacrylate, and 411 g. (3.00 moles) of n-butyl bromide is added dropwise over a period of 3–4 hours. During this addition, an exothermic reaction ensues and is controlled at −20°, and on completion of the addition, the vessel is maintained at this temperature, with stirring, for an additional 30 minutes. The contents of the flask are filtered with suction through a 70-mm.-diameter, slit-sieve Buchner funnel, without filter paper, to remove the excess lithium metal. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure. The residual lithium alcoholate is hydrolyzed by the addition of 1 l. of 10% hydrochloric acid, with ice bath cooling. The liberated alcohol is extracted with two 400-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed with two 400-ml. portions of water and dried over 100 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After suction filtration and removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure, the crude alcohol is distilled under reduced pressure through a 40-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 147–158 g. (80–86%) of 3-butyl-2-methyl-1-hepten-3-ol, b.p. 80° (1mm.). The purity of the product, determined by GC analysis, is greater than 99%.
A dry, 300-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet at its top, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 100 ml. of benzene and flushed briefly with nitrogen, after which 22 ml. (0.057 mole) of a 25% solution of trimethylaluminum in hexane is injected through the septum into the flask. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice–salt bath at −10° to −15°, and 2.47 g. (3.64 ml., 0.0549 mole) of dimethylamine is added slowly with a syringe. Twenty minutes after the addition is completed, the cooling bath is removed, and the contents of the flask are allowed to stir and warm slowly to room temperature over a 45-minute period. A solution of 7.10 g. (0.0500 mole) of methyl cyclohexanecarboxylate in 20 ml. of benzene is injected through the septum. The resulting solution is heated under reflux for 22 hours, cooled to room temperature, and hydrolyzed by slow, cautious addition of 82.5 ml. (0.055 mole) of 0.67 M hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes to ensure complete hydrolysis. The upper organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 25-ml. portions of ethyl acetate. The organic extracts are combined, washed with sodium chloride solution, dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residual liquid under reduced pressure through a 10-cm. Vigreux column affords a 0.1–0.6 g. forerun of unreacted ester and 6.40–7.25 g. (83–93%) of N,N-dimethylcyclohexanecarboxamide, b.p. 100° (5.5 mm.), 57–60° (0.08 mm.).
The combined yield is 24–32 g. (47–62 per cent on the basis of the γ-chlorobutyronitrile used). The amino acid may be recrystallized by dissolving it in the least possible amount of distilled water and adding 5 to 7 volumes of absolute alcohol.
B. 1,2-Dicyanocyclobutene (2). A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube is charged with 131 g. (1.30 moles) of triethylamine and 400 ml. of benzene. The stirred solution is heated to gentle reflux, and a solution of 168.5 g. (1.199 moles) of crude cyclobutane 1 in 200 ml. of benzene is added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. After addition is complete, the mixture is stirred under reflux for an additional 2 hours; the precipitated triethylamine hydrochloride is filtered from the cold solution and washed with 150 ml. of benzene. The combined filtrates are washed twice with 200-ml. portions of water and evaporated using a water aspirator at a bath temperature of 35°. The residue is distilled, yielding 105–110 g. (83–87%) of crude cyclobutene 2, b.p. 55–60° (0.06 mm.).
A. 4-[(Bromophenyl)azo]morpholine . In a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed 4-bromoaniline (15.0 g, 87 mmol , Note 1) and 6 N hydrochloric acid (HCl), 36.4 mL, 210 mmol ) and the mixture is warmed on a water bath to make a clear solution. It is cooled to 0°C to produce a heavy precipitate. A solution of sodium nitrite (6.30 g, 91 mmol) in water (10 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min. Stirring is continued at 0°C for 20 min, and morpholine (8.3 g, 9.0 mL, 96 mmol) is added dropwise to the above solution over 10 min. Water (100 mL) is added followed by the dropwise addition of 10% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (130 mL). After the solution is stirred for a further hour, the precipitated solid is filtered, washed with water and dried in air. The solid is dissolved in hot light petroleum (60-80 fraction) (80 mL) and treated with activated charcoal (1.5 g). The mixture is filtered while hot and the filtrate concentrated to ca. 40 mL. Upon cooling to room temperature, shiny crystals of the pure triazene are obtained. The mother liquor is concentrated to give a second crop of crystals (combined yield 20.3 g, 85%, Notes 4, 5).
D. 3,3-Dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-one. In a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is placed 35.1 g (0.25 mol) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-2-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptanol and 200 mL of acetone. The solution is cooled with an ice-water bath while 100 mL of 2.7 M Jones reagent is added in small portions over 15 min with vigorous stirring. The ice–water bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred at 5–20°C for 2 hr. Then 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted with three 500-mL portions of ether. The extractions are combined and washed successively with 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The solvent is removed by means of a rotary evaporator, and the resulting product is transferred to a separatory funnel and separated from the water. The aqueous layer is extracted with 50 mL of ether. The product and the ether layer are combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation using a rotary evaporator and the product is distilled through a 15-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give 28.7–32.2 g (83–93% yield) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-one (4), bp 72–75°C (12 mm), nD20 1.4622.
The 1-L flask is charged with magnesium turnings (39.6 g, 1.65 g-atom) and dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL). The mixture is heated to reflux temperature under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen, and a crystal of iodine is added. The dropping funnel is filled with 1-chlorobutane (173 mL, 152.5 g, 1.65 mol) and a portion (15 mL) is added to the boiling THF mixture. The source of heat is removed. After the reaction has commenced, the THF begins to boil more vigorously and a further volume (400 mL) of THF is added to the reaction mixture. Then the remainder of the chlorobutane is added slowly at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction under reflux. Finally, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux until all the magnesium has been consumed (0.5–1 hr).
Five hundred grams (1.5 moles) of crude p-tolylmercuric chloride (p. 519) and 720 g. (4.6 moles) of potassium permanganate are added to a solution of 1200 g. (30 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 18 l. of water contained in a large enameled pail (or similar vessel) placed on a 15-cm. Fletcher burner and provided with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred and heated as near boiling as possible for fifteen minutes. The highest temperature conveniently obtainable is 95°. The tolylmercuric chloride dissolves, forming the sodium salt of p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid. The solution is cooled somewhat and alcohol is added to react with the excess of potassium permanganate (250 cc. is generally required to completely decolorize the solution). The manganese dioxide thus precipitated is removed by filtering with suction. The filtrate should be clear and colorless. (If it is green, not enough alcohol has been added.)
A 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, is charged with 40 g. (0.33 mole) of powdered tin and, 52 g. (0.19 mole) of anisoin, 52 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 60 ml. of 95% alcohol. After the mixture is refluxed for 24 hours, the boiling solution is decanted from undissolved tin, cooled to 0°, and the white crystals are filtered by suction. The filtrate is heated to boiling and then used to wash the tin by decantation. The combined washings are cooled to 0°, and the crystalline solid is collected by suction filtration. Recrystallization of the combined solids from 450 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol and gives, on cooling to 0°, colorless crystals of deoxyanisoin melting at 108–111°. The yield is 42–45 g. (86–92%).
The mixture is then fractionally distilled until the temperature reaches 140°. The first fraction boiling at 75–95° consists mostly of ethanol and water, and is discarded. The fraction boiling between 95° and 140° contains water and 25–30 g. of β-ethoxypropionitrile. This is extracted twice with 50-ml. portions of benzene, and the benzene extracts are added to the cooled residue in the distilling flask. The mixture is filtered, the solid material is washed with 75 ml. of benzene, which is added to the filtrate, and the whole is distilled. The fraction boiling at 169–174° is collected; it weighs 178–200 g. (52–58%).
The oxidation mixture is now divided into two equal portions and each portion is treated as follows: To the mixture is added a solution of 200 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 600 cc. of water. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 15 minutes to coagulate the manganese dioxide which is filtered while still very hot. After filtration the manganese dioxide is placed in a 4-l. beaker and boiled with 2 l. of water to dissolve any azelaic acid that may adhere to it. This mixture is filtered while hot, and the filtrate is added to the main portion.
The acid chloride solution is transferred from the 500-mL flask to the 250-mL addition funnel. The solution is added to the 1-L flask containing the methylamine solution over 45 min while maintaining the internal temperature at <25 Â¿C with an ice bath. Caution! The reaction is exothermic. The resulting white suspension is stirred at ambient temperature for a minimum of 30 min and filtered through a BÂ¿chner funnel. The filter cake is washed with water (2 Â¿100 mL) and dried under vacuum (30 mmHg) at 40 Â¿C for a minimum of 24 h to afford 50.9-51.5 g (95-96%) of the desired product 2 as a white crystalline solid.
The mixture is well stirred and heated externally by hot water (50–60°), the water removed, and the fumaryl chloride admitted at a brisk rate, moderated only enough to avoid a too rapid evolution of hydrogen chloride; this requires 15–25 minutes and. The mixture turns dark red and soon reaches the boiling point; hydrogen chloride is rapidly given off. The mixture is then refluxed gently for 10 minutes with stirring.
By concentrating the mother liquor to about one-half of its original volume at room temperature or lower, under reduced pressure by means of a water pump, an additional 10 g. of benzalaniline may be obtained. This is of good quality and melts at 51°.

A dry, 150-mL Schlenk tube connected to a supply of argon is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a glass stopper. The vessel is charged with benzeneruthenium(II) chloride dimer, [RuCl2(benzene)]2, (800 mg, 1.60 mmol) and (R)-BINAP (1.89 g, 3.04 mmol), evacuated, and then filled with argon. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (30 mL) is introduced with a hypodermic syringe under the stream of argon. The reddish brown suspension is stirred at 100°C for 10 min and the resulting clear reddish brown solution is cooled. Another dry, 60-mL Schlenk tube is charged with sodium acetate (5.20 g, 63.4 mmol) and methanol (50 mL) and the solution is degassed by three freeze-thaw cycles. It is transferred into the DMF solution of BINAP-Ru(II) complex prepared above via cannula and the solution is stirred at 25°C for 5 min. To the solution are added water (50 mL) and toluene (25 mL) under argon and the resulting two layers are mixed by vigorous stirring. The upper organic layer is transferred into another 200-mL Schlenk tube using a cannula. The aqueous layer is vigorously mixed with toluene (25 mL) and the upper organic layer is again transferred into the Schlenk tube. This procedure is repeated once more. The combined organic layers are washed with four 10-mL portions of water. Removal of the solvent at 1 mm and 40°C for 30 min with vigorous stirring and evacuation at 0.1 mm and 25°C for 12 hr gives 2.54–2.67 g of solid Ru(OCOCH3)2 [(R)-BINAP] (99–104% crude yield based on BINAP). It is dissolved in toluene (20–25 mL) with heating. Hexane (80–100 mL) is added very carefully to the solution down the side of the flask to form two layers. The solution is left at 25°C for 12 hr and then at 4°C for 3 days to give solid material. Removal of the mother liquor is followed by washing with hexane (20 mL) and drying under reduced pressure to afford 1.8–2.2 g (71–85% yield) of pure Ru(OCOCH3)2 [(R)-BINAP] as fine yellow needles or powdery crystals; mp 188–190°C dec.

(0.67 mole) of bromine in 500 ml. of acetic acid is added through a dropping funnel over a 15-minute period. After addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 5 minutes and is then poured into 1 l. of water. Solid sodium sulfite is added in small portions until the initial yellow color of the solution is discharged, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 1 hour. The slightly yellow dibromoketone is then collected by filtration and air-dried. Recrystallization from 1 l. of ligroin yields 97 g. of white needles, m.p. 79–87°; an additional 11 g., m.p. 79–83°, is obtained by concentrating the mother liquors, and the two crops are combined.
E. 4-Methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, S-[[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)-dimethylsilyl]oxy]methyl] ester (5). An oven-dried 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is capped with a rubber septum pierced with a nitrogen inlet needle connected to a gas bubbler. A thermocouple thermometer probe is also inserted through the septum. The septum is removed momentarily and 4-methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, sodium salt (4) (5.97 g, 28.4 mmol, 1.03 equiv) and acetonitrile (35 mL) are added and the suspension is stirred. (Chloromethoxy)(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilane (3) (4.96 g, 27.4 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added via a 10-mL syringe over 1 min. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 4 h, then the septum is replaced with a 200-mL addition funnel and t-butyl methyl ether (140 mL) is added dropwise to the stirred mixture over 15 min. The mixture is filtered through a tightly packed pad of Celite (4 cm in diameter x 2.5 cm in height) in a 40-mL sintered glass funnel into a pre-weighed 500-mL round-bottomed flask, using MTBE (3 x 10 mL) as a rinse of the flask and filter cake. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C bath, 70 mmHg) and dried for 3 h at ambient temperature (70 mmHg) to give 4-methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, S-[[[(1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)dimethylsilyl]-oxy]methyl] ester (5) as a colorless, viscous oil (9.06 g, 99 %).
B. 3-Isoquinuclidone. A mixture of 4.53 g. of cis- and trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid and 30 ml. of Dowtherm A is heated as rapidly as possible to reflux temperature. Heating is continued for 20 minutes during which time the water formed is allowed to distill away; at the end of this time, solution has taken place. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and is diluted with 100 ml. of isooctane. The solution is extracted three times with 50-ml. portions of water. The combined water extracts are treated with charcoal, filtered, and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. The residue is crystallized from cyclohexane giving 3.20–3.33 g. (81–84%) of 3-isoquinuclidone, m.p. 197–198°.
2-(2-Bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanal (2). The previous 500-mL round-bottomed flask with the crude 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanenitrile (1) is equipped with an oval stirring bar (32 mm x 15 mm), argon inlet and a rubber septum. An argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system. The flask is charged through the septum (via syringe) with anhydrous CH2Cl2 (150 mL) and immersed in a previously cooled dry ice/acetone bath at -78 ºC (internal temperature). Then, DIBAL-H (45 mL, 45.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe over a 15 min period, resulting in a pale orange solution. The reaction progress is followed by TLC analysis or GC analysis. After 2 h reaction time, additional DIBAL-H (20.4 mL, 20.4 mmol, 0.5 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe; after stirring for an additional 1 h, no more starting material is observed by TLC analysis. The flask is removed from the cooled bath, and the reaction is then quenched by slow addition of ethyl acetate (150 mL) and 2M HCl (100 mL) over a 10 min period. The organic phase is separated using a 1-L separatory funnel and the aqueous solution is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate (8 g) and concentrated by rotary evaporation (from 760 mmHg to 26 mmHg, 40 °C). The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The title compound is thus obtained as a yellow oil (8.00-8.09 g, 69-70% yield).
To a mixture of 500 g. (5.3 moles) of chloroacetic acid and 500 g. of cracked ice, is added, with stirring, just sufficient cold 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to make the solution faintly alkaline to phenolphthalein. About 360 cc. is required; the temperature should not rise above 20°. The solution is then mixed with 365 g. (5.3 moles) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 500 cc. of water and heated in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a two-holed stopper containing a bent tube of large diameter connecting with an efficient condenser (set downward for distillation) and a thermometer dipping into the liquid.

Methanesulfonyl chloride (29.8 mL, 0.385 mol) is added dropwise via a 50-mL glass syringe over a period of 10 min. After an additional 30 min, the ice-water bath is removed, and the stirred solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. After an additional 6 hr a precipitate forms ( pyridinium chloride ); 300 mL of an aqueous saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is added slowly, dissolving the precipitate. The solution is stirred for a further 30 min and then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 100 mL). The organic layers are combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate , and the drying agent is removed by filtration. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to give a tan solid that can be used as such or recrystallized from 1:1 chloroform-diethyl ether to give the product as a crystalline white solid, mp 77-78°C, 43 g (88% yield).

After about 8 min a white precipitate begins to appear, and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for a total of 3 hr. The solid is filtered, washed with acetonitrile (2 × 25 mL), and dried under vacuum at 40°C overnight to afford (R)-(+)-2-hydroxy-1,2,2-triphenylethyl acetate (35.42 g, 0.107 mol, 88%) as a white solid.
A. 2,4-Bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (1). A dry 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, and ground-glass stopper, is charged with 111.0 g (0.25 mol) of phosphorus sulfide, P4S10 and 270 g (2.5 mol) of anisole. Stirring is commenced and the mixture is heated at reflux temperature by use of a heating mantle. After 1 hr, the solution is homogeneous and after a second hour 2,4-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide (1) begins to precipitate. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the precipitate is filtered and washed with anhydrous ether (2 × 50 mL) and 50 mL of anhydrous chloroform (free of alcohols) to yield 160–165 g (79–82%) of pale-yellow crystals, mp 228°C and.
In a 16-l. earthenware jar are placed 250 g. (4.7 moles) of technical ammonium chloride, 8 l. of water, and 500 g. (416 cc., 4.1 moles) of nitrobenzene. The mixture is stirred vigorously by means of a mechanical stirrer, and 620 g. (8.1 atoms) of zinc dust of 85 per cent purity is added during the course of fifteen to twenty minutes. As the reduction proceeds, the temperature rises to 60–65°. Stirring is continued for fifteen minutes after all the zinc dust has been added, at the end of which time the reaction is complete, as indicated by the fact that the temperature of the mixture ceases to rise.
A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter, is charged with the 41.5 g of crude β-lactone prepared above, 200 mL of cyclohexane, and 41.5 g of 230-400 mesh silica gel. The resulting yellow mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr (water may be observed collecting in the condenser) and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Activated charcoal (6 g) is added, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 5 min and filtered. The residue is washed with an additional 50 mL of cyclohexane and the combined filtrates are concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to afford 31.5 g of a yellow oil. This crude material is applied to the top of a 4.8-cm × 30-cm column of 210 g of 230-400 mesh silica gel 60 and eluted with hexane (20 mL per min, 120-mL fractions). Concentration of fractions 3–5 using a rotary evaporator and then high vacuum (0.1 mm) affords 22.0–23.0 g (66–69% overall yield) of (E)-2,3-dimethyl-3-dodecene as a clear, colorless oil ((Note 16),(Note 17),(Note 18)).

A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a cylindrical-shaped magnetic stirbar (4 cm x 1 cm) and 2 rubber septa is charged through the open neck with ester 2 (5.0 g, 21.9 mmol). A third septum is added, the flask is evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen by piercing a septum with a needle connected to a Schlenck manifold. Tetrahydrofuran (70 mL) is added via a 20-mL plastic syringe. The flask is submersed in an ice bath, and the solution is stirred for 5 min before it is treated with a 0.5 M solution of 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane [9-BBN] in THF (46 mL, 23.0 mmol, 1.05 equiv), added dropwise over 12 min via a 20-mL plastic syringe. Upon completion of the addition, the cold bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2.5 h, then quenched with deionized water (70 mL), added slowly through an open neck via a 100 mL graduated cylinder. The septum is replaced, and the flask is evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen. The resulting suspension is stirred for 2.5 h, after which time it is sparged with argon for 15 min.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask equipped with a stirrer are placed 139 g. (0.3 mole) of the addition compound, 700 cc. of acetone, and 38 g. (0.6 gram atom) of copper powder. The mixture is cooled at once to about 20°, stirred for one hour, and then allowed to stand overnight. The insoluble material is collected on a Büchner funnel. The solid mixture is extracted with about 3 l. of boiling commercial xylene and filtered through a hot funnel. On cooling the filtrate, crystals of β-naphthylmercuric chloride separate. The yield of product which melts at 266–267° is 52–64 g. (40–49 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the amine used) and.
D. 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-Octaethylporphyrin (5). A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is wrapped with aluminum foil and equipped with a reflux condenser with a Dean-Stark trap, mechanical stirrer, and nitrogen inlet. The flask is charged with 3,4-diethylpyrrole (1 g, 8.1 mmol), benzene (300 mL), a 37% solution of aqueous formaldehyde (0.73 mL, 8.9 mmol), and p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.03 g, 1.7 mmol). The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux under nitrogen using an oil bath, and the water is removed by means of the Dean-Stark trap. After 8 hr, the solution is cooled, and the Dean-Stark trap and condenser are replaced with a fritted glass aerator/bubbler. Oxygen is bubbled through the brown mixture while it is stirred for 12–24 hr. Benzene is removed from the flask by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue is dissolved in chloroform (20 mL). The solution is washed with 1 N sodium hydroxide (40 mL) and water (2 × 20 mL). The chloroform solution is concentrated to 5 mL in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, carefully layered over with methanol (≈70 mL), and allowed to stand for 48 hr. The resulting solid is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure for 24 hr. The crude material is recrystallized twice from chloroform-hexanes [effected by dissolving in chloroform (≈10 mL), layering over with hexanes (≈70 mL), and allowing to stand overnight]. The final precipitate is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure for 48 hr to yield analytically pure 2,3,7,8,12,13,17,18-octaethylporphyrin (720 mg, 1.34 mmol, 66.4%) as a purple, amorphous powder.
In a 2-l. flask, fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a soda-lime drying tube and a glass tube reaching almost to the bottom, is placed 325 g. (420 ml.) of absolute ethanol. The whole is then tared and placed in an ice bath, and the inlet tube is connected to a source of dry methylamine.
A. cis-2-p(Toluenesulfonamido)cyclohexanol. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 8.2 g (0.1 mol) of cyclohexene, 250 mL of reagent grade chloroform, and 10 mL (1 mmol) of osmium tetroxide catalyst solution. To the resulting black solution is added a solution of 35.2 g (0.125 mol) of chloramine-T trihydrate and 1.1 g (5 mmol) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride in 250 mL of distilled water. Vigorous stirring is begun, and the reaction mixture is brought to 55–60°C by means of a heating mantle.
The mixture is then distilled, and the distillate boiling below 150° is collected in a 2-l. flask containing 1 l. of water. The lower layer of crude β-ethoxyethyl bromide is separated and dried over 10 g. of calcium chloride. The liquid is decanted and distilled through a 25-cm. fractionating column, and the fraction boiling at 125–127°/760 mm. is collected. The yield of pure product is 660–670 g. (65–66% based on the phosphorus tribromide).
A. Ethyl 4-amino-3-(methylthiomethyl)benzoate. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser topped with a gas-inlet tube, a two-necked adapter holding a low-temperature thermometer, and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 16.50 g. (0.1000 mole) of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (Benzocaine,), 300 ml. of acetonitrile, and 100 ml. of dichloromethane, flushed with nitrogen, and immersed in a 40% aqueous methanol–dry-ice bath maintained between −40° and −50°. When the reaction mixture has come to −40°, a solution of 10.85 g. (0.1000 mole) of tert-butyl hypochlorite [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 184 (1973)] in 25 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise over a 15-minute period. The addition funnel is rinsed with 25 ml. of dichloromethane, the reaction solution is stirred for another 5 minutes, and 23 g. (25 ml., 0.34 mole) of dimethyl sulfide is added at a rate that allows the vigorously stirred reaction mixture to be maintained below −30°.
D. trans-4,7,7-Tricarbomethoxy-2-phenylsulfonylbicyclo[3.3.0]oct-1-ene. In a flame-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel, and nitrogen inlet, is placed 1.44 g of sodium hydride (60% in oil, 36.0 mmol) which has been washed twice with 50 mL of hexane and then suspended in 500 mL of anhydrous THF. After 7.59 g (33.0 mmol) of dimethyl (E)-5-methoxycarbonyl-2-hexenedioate in 50 mL of THF is added to the above mixture, it is stirred at 0°C for 30 min. Then a solution containing 10.02 g (30.0 mmol) of 2,3-bis(phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-butadiene in 900 mL of anhydrous THF is added over 30 min. The solution is stirred for 10 min at 0°C and then quenched with 100 mL of a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is extracted three times with 300 mL of dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed with 100 mL each of water, brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is chromatographed on 350 g of silica gel eluting with 4 L of a 2:1-hexane/ethyl acetate mixture to give 9.54 g (75%) of trans-4,7,7-tricarbomethoxy-2-phenylsulfonylbicyclo[3.3.0]oct-1-ene as a clear oil.
To a solution of 300 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate in 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in a 1-l. beaker there is added 96 g. of the sulfone, and the mixture is stirred occasionally. Evolution of heat is sufficiently great so that, after 10–15 minutes, external cooling is necessary to prevent violent boiling with possible loss of material. After nearly all the solid has dissolved, the mixture is heated on the steam bath for 2 hours. The solution is then cooled and added to 1.35 l. of 40% sodium hydroxide solution contained in a 3-l. beaker; it is necessary to stir mechanically and to add about 1.5 kg. of ice during the operation. The final temperature should be about 10°. After standing for 30 minutes the crude amine is filtered with suction and washed with water (200–250 ml.) until free from alkali.
A. 2,2-Dimethyl-4-oxopentanal. (See.) Oxygen is bubbled for 2 hr through a stirred solution of copper(I) chloride (32.8 g, 0.33 mol), palladium(II) chloride (1.19 g, 0.007 mol), 829 mL of dimethylformamide, and 331 mL of water in a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask cooled in a water bath. 2,2-Dimethyl-4-pentenal (185.6 g, 1.66 mol) is added to the solution and oxygen is bubbled through for an additional 60 hr at room temperature. The solution is acidified to litmus with 10% hydrochloric acid and extracted 4 times with 200 mL of ethyl ether. The combined organic layers are washed 3 times with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed first by rotary evaporation and then under reduced pressure (0.2 mm). In this way 133.6 g (1.04 mol) of keto-aldehyde is obtained in 62.7% yield. The original aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted 5 times with 200 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether. The combined organic layers are washed 3 times with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium sulfate. Solvent is removed by rotary evaporation and vacuum pump. An additional 31.5 g (0.25 mol) of keto-aldehyde is recovered to give a total yield of 78%, bp 32°C (0.3 mm).
B. (E)-3-Pentyl-2-nonene-1,4-diol (4). Half the amount of the Grignard reagent 2 prepared according to Procedure A is diluted with ether (160 mL) and cooled in an ice–water bath to 0°C. A solution of hexanal (9.25 g, 92.5 mmol) dissolved in ether (30 mL) is added through the dropping funnel over 30 min with efficient stirring. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at 0–5°C for 2 hr and then poured into saturated ammonium chloride solution (300 mL). The mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr. The resulting precipitate is removed by filtration through a pad of Celite (70 × 24 mm) under reduced pressure and the precipitate is washed with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (150 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave an oil that is purified by column chromatography on silica gel and to afford 4 (7.0–7.4 g, 59–62% yield).
(−)-2,10-Camphorsultam. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1.5-in egg-shaped Teflon stirring bar, a 250-mL addition funnel, and a 300-mL Soxhlet extraction apparatus equipped with a mineral oil bubbler connected to an inert-gas source. The flask is charged with 600 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 6.2 g (0.16 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride. Into the 50-mL Soxhlet extraction thimble is placed 35.0 g (0.16 mol) of (−)-(camphorsulfonyl)imine and the reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux. After all of the (camphorsulfonyl)imine has been siphoned into the reaction flask (3–4 hr), the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The unreacted lithium aluminum hydride is cautiously hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of 200 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid via the addition funnel. After the hydrolysis is complete the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the lower, silver-colored aqueous layer is separated, and the upper layer placed in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask. The aqueous phase is returned to the separatory funnel and washed with methylene chloride (3 × 100 mL). After the reaction flask is rinsed with methylene chloride (50 mL), the organic washings are combined with the THF phase and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 10–15 min. Filtration through a 300-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity into a 1-L round-bottomed flask followed by removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives 33.5 g (95%) of the crude (−)-2,10-camphorsultam. The crude sultam is placed in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and crystallized from approximately 60 mL of absolute ethanol. The product is collected on a 150-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity and dried in a vacuum desiccator to give 31.1 g (88%) of the pure sultam. A second crop of crystals can be gained by evaporating approximately half the filtrate; the residue is crystallized as above to give 1.4 g (4%). The combined yield of white crystalline solid, mp 183–184°C, [α]D −30.7° (CHCl3, c 2.3) is 92% and.
The mixture is cooled while being well stirred, and, when the temperature reaches about 65°, 57 g. (0.6 mole) of methyl chloroformate is added during five to ten minutes. The mixture is then warmed slowly so that the boiling point is reached in about fifteen to twenty minutes. Boiling and stirring are maintained for five hours.
When the reaction mixture has warmed to room temperature, stirring is made more vigorous, and 100 ml. of water is added. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Removal of dichloromethane with a rotary evaporator leaves an oily residue, which is cooled in an ice bath, inducing crystallization. The resulting solid is stirred with 50 ml. of diethyl ether for 30 minutes at 0°, collected by filtration, and washed with 25 ml. of ether at 0°. Concentration of the filtrate to 15 ml. and chilling at ca. 5° overnight yields a second crop of crystalline product, bringing the total crude yield to 14.7–18.0 g. (59–73%), m.p. 120.5–124°. Recrystallization from absolute ethanol (5 ml. per 2 g.) yields 12.8–17.5 g. (51–70%) of ethyl 2-methyl-3-methylthioindole-5-carboxylate, m.p. 125.5–127°.
Diethyl ether is removed by distillation and the residual product is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 30.5 g (65%) of acetylallene as a colorless liquid.
To a 5-L, four-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser with a nitrogen inlet, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, are added 150 g (2.6 mol) of acetone and 192 g (1.9 mol) of triethylamine under a nitrogen atmosphere. To this mixture, stirred at room temperature under nitrogen, is added via the dropping funnel 200 g (1.84 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane over 10 min. The flask is then immersed in a water bath and the contents are warmed to 35°C. The water bath is removed and the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 285 g (1.9 mol) of sodium iodide in 2.14 L of acetonitrile. This solution is added to the stirred mixture in the flask at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction is maintained at 34–40°C without external heating or cooling. The addition requires approximately 1 hr. When addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for a further 2 hr at room temperature. The contents of the flask are then poured into 5 L of ice-cold water, and the aqueous mixture is extracted with two 1-L portions of pentane, and once with 500 mL of pentane. The combined pentane extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered into a 3-L, round-bottomed flask. This is arranged for distillation at atmospheric pressure, incorporating a 30-cm Vigreux fractionating column. The pentane is distilled off at atmospheric pressure, until a head temperature of 88°C is attained. The crude material is transferred to a 500-mL flask, and the product is then distilled at atmospheric pressure through a 20-cm Vigreux column. A forerun of 20 g is collected between room temperature and 94°C. The product is the fraction boiling at 94–96°C, the yield of which is 116–130 g (48–54%).
The liquid layer is decanted into a 5-l. flask, and the sodium salt of the diketone is dissolved and washed into the flask with 2.5 l. of ice water. After the salt is dissolved, the ester layer is separated as soon as possible. The water layer is extracted twice with 300-ml. portions of ether, and the ether extract is discarded. To the water solution is added ice-cold dilute sulfuric acid (150 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 400 g. of cracked ice) until the solution is just acid to litmus. The diketone is extracted from the solution with four 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried for 24 hours over 60 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate in the icebox. The ether solution is decanted into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and the sodium sulfate is extracted with 100 ml. of anhydrous ether. This extract is added to the ether solution, and the ether is distilled by means of a steam bath. The residue is transferred to a 500-ml. flask, rinsing with a little ether, and distilled through a Widmer column, the portion boiling between 130° and 139° being collected. This fraction is dried over 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for 1 hour and, after the carbonate has been removed, is redistilled through the Widmer column. The portion boiling at 134–136° is collected; it amounts to 115–136 g. (38–45% based on acetone).
The combined filtrates, which contain 1-phenylbiguanide as the free base, are placed in a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a drying tube containing calcium chloride, and a dropping funnel, and 36.8 g. (0.30 mole) of ethyl chloroacetate is added at room temperature with stirring. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 14 hours, during which time 2-amino-4-anilino-6-(chloromethyl)-s-triazine precipitates as a white solid. After being separated by filtration and air-dried, the triazine weighs 37–40 g. and melts at 138–140°. The methanol filtrate is added to 500 ml. of cold water. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath with stirring for 2 hours and filtered to remove an additional 10–12 g. of gray triazine, m.p. 140–142°. The total yield of crude product is 47–52 g.
Stirring is continued for about one hour after the addition of the last of the cyclohexanol. Then the mixture is cooled to about 0° and the adipic acid is collected on a suction filter, washed with 500 cc. of ice water, and dried in the air overnight. The yield is 395–410 g. of white crystals which melt at 146–149°. Evaporation of the nitric acid mother liquors yields an additional 30–40 g. of product which melts at 141–144°. The total yield of crude adipic acid is 425–440 g. (58–60 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is pure enough for most purposes. However, a purer product may be obtained by recrystallizing this crude material from 700 cc. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42). The loss in this purification is about 5 per cent. The recrystallized acid melts at 151–152° and.
Most of the excess hydrogen chloride is removed by adding porous tile and evacuating the flask with a water pump for a half hour, while it is surrounded by a water bath maintained at about 40°. Two hundred grams of sodium carbonate is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water in a 5-l. flask, and 2 l. of cracked ice added. Into this solution the reaction mixture is poured in a thin stream with vigorous shaking, and the solution is extracted at once with three 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are washed countercurrently with four 250-cc. portions of ice-cold 5 per cent sodium chloride solution to remove the alcohol and then combined in a 3-l. flask placed in an ice bath.
F. Carbazole-based tetrakismacrocycle (6). A 400-mL Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a glass stopper is introduced to a glove box. The flask is sequentially charged with 4-nitrophenol (0.680 g, 4.89 mmol), trisamidomolybdenum(VI) propylidyne (1.09 g, 1.63 mmol) and CCl4 (150 mL). The resulting solution is stirred for 4 min and the solution changes from light yellow to orange. A solution of monomer 5 (15.1 g, 16.3 mmol) in CCl4 (200 mL) is added to the stirred catalyst solution. The flask is sealed with grease and electrical tape and is removed from the glove box. The resulting mixture is stirred at 50 °C for 24 h during which time a light-yellow precipitate forms and the color of the reaction mixture changes from yellow to brown. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, along with CH2Cl2 (200 mL). The solids are removed by suction filtration through a medium-porosity fritted-glass funnel and are washed with CH2Cl2 (2 × 50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20–25 mmHg, water bath temperature 40–45 °C). Methanol (200 mL) is added to the residue and the resulting suspension is filtered, washed with methanol (3 × 75 mL) and dried in vacuo. The crude product is further purified by silica gel column chromatography [silica gel, 44 × 572 mm, CHCl3/CH2Cl2, 3/1 to 1/1] to afford macrocyclic product 6 as a pale-yellow solid (3.80 g, 61%).
B. 1,2,3,4,5-Pentamethylcyclopentadiene. A mixture of 13 g (0.068 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and 300 mL of diethyl ether is stirred under argon in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a 250-mL addition funnel. The concentrate from above is added as quickly as possible to the flask from the addition funnel, maintaining a gentle reflux. As the reaction proceeds, a water layer separates. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr after the addition is completed and then washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until the washings remain basic. The ethereal layer is separated, and the combined aqueous layers are extracted three times with diethyl ether. The combined ethereal layers are dried over sodium sulfate. Diethyl ether is removed by rotary evaporation, and the crude product is distilled under reduced pressure (bp 55–60°C, 13 mm): yield 73–75 g (73–75%).
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, which is fitted with a Clarke-Rahrs column1 with a unit for removing water and surmounted by a reflux condenser, are placed 100 g. (0.63 mole) of ethyl malonate, about 72–76 g. of commercial benzaldehyde, 2–7 ml. of piperidine, and 200 ml. of benzene. The mixture is refluxed vigorously in an oil bath at 130–140° until no more water (total, 12–13 ml.) is collected; this operation requires 11–18 hours. After the mixture has been cooled, 100 ml. of benzene is added and the solution is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, with two 100-ml. portions of 1 N hydrochloric acid, and then with 100 ml. of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous wash solutions are shaken with a single 50-ml. portion of benzene, the benzene extract is added to the original organic layer, and the organic solution is dried with 30 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the benzene has been removed under reduced pressure on a steam bath, the residue is distilled under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask well wrapped with asbestos. The yield of colorless ethyl benzalmalonate boiling at 140–142° /4 mm. is 137–142 g. (89–91%).
A. 4-Hexyn-1-yl methanesulfonate (1). An oven-dried, 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is flushed with argon and 260 mL of dichloromethane is added. The flask is sealed with a rubber septum inlet and cooled to ca. −10°C in an ice-salt bath. To this flask are added via syringe 11 mL (80 mmol) of triethylamine, 5.0 g (51 mmol) of 4-hexyn-1-ol, and 4.3 mL (56 mmol) of methanesulfonyl chloride. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 30 min and then quenched by adding 30 mL of ice-water. The organic layer is separated and washed successively with 1 M hydrochloric acid solution (30 mL), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL), and brine (30 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give 8.3–9.0 g (93–100%) of crude 4-hexyn-1-yl methanesulfonate (1) which was used directly in the next step.
The ether layer containing the bromomalonic acid is separated from the aqueous layer, and the ether is removed by distillation from a steam cone. The residual liquid is decarboxylated by refluxing for 5 hours in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask on an oil bath heated to 130°. The bromo acid is then separated from the small amount of water and distilled. The material distilling at 125–140°/18–20 mm. is α-bromo-β-methylvaleric acid. The yield is 150.5 g. (66.7%).
The product is distilled under reduced pressure through a short (8 cm.) Vigreux column and has b.p. 75° (78 mm.), 44° (23 mm.), n25D = 1.4741, d425 = 0.8456. The yield of pure trans-cyclooctene is 15.0 – 15.3 g. (40%),,,.
A. 1-Phenyldialin. A solution of phenylmagnesium bromide is prepared in the usual manner1 from 11 g. (0.45 gram atom) of magnesium, 75 g. (0.48 mole) of bromobenzene, and 175 ml. of ether. As soon as the metal has reacted, a solution of 58.4 g. (0.4 mole) of α-tetralone in 60 ml. of ether is added from a dropping funnel as rapidly as possible so that vigorous refluxing is maintained; about 30 minutes is required. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for an additional 30 minutes and allowed to stand for 1 hour. The magnesium complex is decomposed by about 250 g. of ice and 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The ether layer is separated and distilled with steam to remove impurities; about 6 hours is necessary, and approximately 4.5 l. of distillate is collected. The heavy residual oil is separated from the water, and 80 ml. of ether and 10 g. of calcium chloride are added. After 4–5 minutes, the calcium chloride is removed by filtration, and the ether is driven off by distillation on a steam bath. Twenty milliliters of acetic anhydride is then added, and the flask and contents are heated in a steam bath for 20–25 minutes. The mixture is finally distilled under reduced pressure through a 15-in. Widmer column. The fraction which boils at 135–140°/2 mm. is collected; the yield is 35–40 g. (42–48%).
This crude product is distilled under reduced pressure to give 48 g (70%) of pure (R)-(−)-methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate (bp 61–62°/18 mm) with a specific rotation of [α]DRT −47.6° (CHCl3, c 1.0).
(B) o-Chlorotoluene.—In a 10-l. stone jar fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 2 kg. (1755 cc.) of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and 428 g. (427 cc., 4 moles) of o-toluidine. The mixture is cooled to 0° by adding cracked ice (about 1 kg. is required). The o-toluidine hydrochloride separates as a finely divided precipitate. The stirrer is started, and to the cold suspension is added a solution of 280 g. (4.05 moles) of sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water; the diazotization is carried out at 0–5° and requires about fifteen minutes. Cracked ice is added from time to time to keep the temperature within the proper limits. The volume of the final solution is 5–6 l.
The residual liquid is transferred to a flask equipped with an efficient fractionating column and distilled under reduced pressure. Benzene is removed first, followed by considerable quantities of iron pentacarbonyl (b.p. 20°, 30 mm.); when the diiron nonacarbonyl has been removed, the pressure is reduced further and cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl2 is collected as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 47° (3 mm.), yielding 13.8–14.4 g. (45–46% based on dichlorocyclobutene),.
The crude diacetate is hydrolyzed by dissolving it in 350 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide and refluxing the solution for 2 hours. The alkaline solution is diluted to about 700 ml., cooled, and filtered. The filtrate is poured into 300 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and the nor-desoxycholic acid is separated by filtration and dried. The crude product is dissolved in about 600 ml. of acetone and filtered, while hot, to remove small amounts of salt. On cooling, 25–30 g. (57–68%) of white crystals which melt at 209–211° is obtained in two crops. This material contains 1 molecule of acetone of crystallization. The fully purified substance softens at about 160° (loss of acetone) and melts at 213.5–214.5°.
The reaction mixture is cooled down again with ice and salt until the temperature reaches 0°, then 2400 g. of finely cracked ice is added in small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10° until one-third of the ice has been added. Then the temperature may be allowed to rise to 25–30°. The addition of the ice requires about two hours; after this, the mixture is cooled again to 0° and then filtered as rapidly as possible through a funnel fitted with a filtros plate. The crystals are thoroughly pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The acetonedicarboxylic acid is light gray to white in color. After the suction and pressing have removed practically all of the sulfuric acid, the crystals are transferred to a beaker and stirred with sufficient ethyl acetate (about 200–250 cc.) to make a thick paste. The crystals are filtered with suction. If acetonedicarboxylic acid entirely free from sulfuric acid is desired, the washing with ethyl acetate should be repeated. The yield of practically dry acetonedicarboxylic acid varies from 450–475 g. (85–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). This may be used directly for the preparation of the ester (p. 237). The acid itself is not stable and after a few hours gradually decomposes.
To a 1-l. flask are added 600 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, 270 g. (250 ml., 2.65 moles) of acetic anhydride, 56 g. (0.50 mole) of 2-methylcyclohexanone, and 0.34 ml. (0.002 mole) of 70% perchloric acid. The reaction flask is stoppered and allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 hours during which time the reaction solution becomes first yellow-orange and finally red in color. The reaction mixture is poured into a cold (0–5°) mixture of 400 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and 400 ml. of pentane contained in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. While the mixture is stirred vigorously at 0–5°, solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is added in 3–5 g. portions as rapidly as foaming of the reaction mixture will permit. The addition of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is continued until the acetic acid has been neutralized and the aqueous phase remains slightly basic (pH 8). This neutralization requires approximately 400 g. of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate added in portions over a period of ca. 3 hours. As soon as the neutralization is complete, the organic layer (the lower layer) is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by distilling the bulk of the pentane through a 30-cm. Vigreux column. The remaining solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 66.6–70.9 g. (87–92%) of 2-methyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl acetate, as a colorless liquid, b.p. 81–86° (18 mm.), nD25 1.4562–1.4572.
C. 2-(2-Acetamidoethyl)-4,5-dimethoxyacetophenone. A slurry of 31.0 g. (0.125 mole) of the methylene derivative obtained in Part B and 75 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid is stirred and warmed on a steam bath to 60–65°. As soon as all the solid has dissolved, the solution is cooled with an ice bath to 30° and basified by slowly adding a solution of 6.25 g. of potassium carbonate in 12.5 ml. of water. The crystalline precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with three 12.5-ml. portions of water, and air-dried, yielding 30.5–32.0 g. (91–93%) of the acetophenone, m.p. 123–125°.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask is placed 300 g. (2.2 moles) of technical p-nitrotoluene (m.p. 51–52°). The flask is fitted with a liquid-sealed stirrer, reflux condenser, and a separatory funnel arranged so that the stem reaches nearly to the bottom of the flask. The condenser is attached to a gas trap. The flask is heated in an oil bath at 145–150°, and 368 g. (118 cc., 2.3 moles) of bromine is added dropwise over a period of two hours.
B. (R)-(+)-N,N-Dibenzyl-N-[1-cyclohexyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynyl]-amine. A 25-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum is flame-dried under vacuum (5 × 10−2 mbar), cooled to rt, flushed with argon and charged with copper(I) bromide (21.5 mg, 0.150 mmol) and (S)-Quinap (72.5 mg, 0.165 mmol). The flask is evacuated (5 × 10−2 mbar) for 15 min, flushed with argon and charged with dry toluene (9 mL) giving a yellow solution with white particles. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at rt, during this time, the solution turns milky. Molecular sieves 4 Å (1.5 g) are added under a flow of argon. Trimethylsilylacetylene (295 mg, 0.43 mL, 3.0 mmol) followed by cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (337 mg, 0.36 mL, 3.0 mmol) are added via syringe in one portion. Dibenzylamine (592 mg, 0.58 mL, 3.0 mmol) is added during one minute via syringe. The suspension is stirred for 43 h at rt, after which time GC-analysis shows more than 96% conversion to the desired product. The solution is filtered and the molecular sieves 4 Å are washed with diethyl ether (50 mL). The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (55 °C, 760 mmHg, then 38 mmHg). The resulting yellow oil is dissolved in pentane:diethyl ether (99:1) and filtered from the precipitated catalyst. The clear filtrate is subjected to column chromatographic purification affording (R)-(+)-N,N-dibenzyl-N-[1-cyclohexyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynyl]-amine (1.07 g, 2.7 mmol) as a clear, colorless oil which solidifies upon standing at rt (91%, 95 % ee).
The solidified product is dissolved in 6-7 l. of water in a 12-l. flask, and a solution of concentrated (95 per cent) sulfuric acid (about 880 cc.) in about 2 l. of water is added until the liquor has a distinct odor of sulfur dioxide. The heat of neutralization is sufficient to cause the solution to boil; it is at once distilled in a current of steam until a sample of the distillate gives only a slight precipitate with bromine water. The distillate (about 6–7 l.) is saturated with salt and the oil separated. The watery solution may be again distilled with steam in order to recover the small amount of cresol in solution. The oil is at once distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 95–96° /15 mm. is collected. The forerun is freed of water and redistilled, yielding a further quantity. On cooling, the product solidifies to a white, crystalline mass melting at 31°. The yield is 200–230 g. (63–72 per cent of the theoretical amount based on sodium p-toluenesulfonate of 95 per cent purity).
A. Diethyl cis-Δ4-tetrahydrophthalate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 228 g. (1.5 moles) of cis-Δ4-tetrahydrophthalic anhydride (p. 890), 525 ml. (9 moles) of commercial absolute ethanol, and 2.5 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The flask is connected to a reflux condenser and heated in an oil bath maintained at 95–105° for 12–16 hours.
4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical overhead stirrer is charged with the hexane solution from step A. To this solution is added a solution of 11.6 g (0.178 mol based on the total solids from the sulfonyl chlorides above) of sodium azide (NaN3) in 100 mL of water and 2.0 g of phase transfer catalyst (Aliquat 336). Stirring is initiated, and the reaction progress is monitored by thin layer chromatography. Approximately 4 hr at 25°C is required to complete the reaction. The two-phase mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is removed. The hexane layer is washed with 100 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over 28 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration, and the cake is washed with 20 mL of hexane. The concentration and purity of the 4-dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides are best determined by evaporation of a small sample to an oil of constant weight with visible spectrophotometric assay for the azide. The hexane solution of dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides, when standardized as above, can be used as obtained for most applications. However, if desired, careful concentration of the hexane solution under reduced pressure at room temperature affords 58.2–61.4 g (90–95%) of the oily mixture of dodecylbenzenesulfonyl azides; corrected for the assay of the azides the yield is usually 95% and.
The sulfuric acid solution of the imino ether sulfate quickly turns cloudy because of the separation of ethyl α-phenylacetoacetate. To complete the hydrolysis, the mixture is heated on the steam bath for one-half hour at the temperature at which the ether just boils (about 50°). It is then cooled, the ester layer separated, and the acid extracted once with 250 cc. of ether. The ether solution is washed once with 100 cc. of water which is recombined with the acid. The acid solution is replaced on the steam bath and heated for forty-five minutes after the temperature reaches 80–90°. After the solution is cooled and extracted as before, all ether extracts, including the original from which the imino ether was removed, are combined and washed once with 250 cc. of 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, once with 250 cc. of water, and then dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with ether, the ether removed from the filtrates, and the residue fractionated in vacuo from a 250-cc. Claisen flask having a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The main fraction boils at 139–143°/12 mm., or 130–134°/5 mm., and weighs 103–167 g. (50–81 per cent of the theoretical amount). By fractional distillation of the fore-run, main fraction, and residue, a product boiling over a one- to two-degree range may be obtained with no change in the yield.
For further purification, 100 g. of the crude product is dissolved in a boiling mixture of 1560 cc. of glacial acetic acid and 350 cc. of water; the solution is boiled for a few minutes with 25 g. of decolorizing carbon, filtered hot, and allowed to cool. The crystals are washed on a Büchner funnel with a small amount of chilled 95 per cent alcohol to remove the acetic acid. The whole of the crude product crystallized in this way furnishes 216–240 g. (64–71 per cent of the theoretical amount) of slightly colored tribromobenzene, melting at 121.5–122.5° (corr.).
The reaction mixture is allowed to stand in an icebox for 16–18 hours to complete the separation of the product, which forms small, well-defined, deeply red-colored crystals. The 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene is filtered by suction, washed with 150–250 ml. of cold water, and sucked dry on the funnel.
The entire reaction mixture is poured into 430 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid (mild exothermic reaction). The organic layer is separated and washed with another 430-mL portion of 10% hydrochloric acid. After further washes with 150 mL of brine and 160 mL of deionized water, all aqueous layers are combined and back-extracted with a 550-mL portion of 3 : 2 toluene : methanol and two 300-mL portions of toluene. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure in a 45°C bath to give 11.4 g (98%) of crude product as a bright-yellow microcrystalline solid, mp 203–205°C.
The reaction product, which is a dark reddish-brown liquid, is poured or siphoned into 1.5 l. of water to which 50 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite has been added. The mixture is distilled with steam (p. 479) and the first portion of the distillate is collected separately to remove a small amount of unchanged nitrobenzene. It is necessary to collect about 12 l. of distillate in order to obtain all the m-bromonitrobenzene. The yellow crystalline solid is filtered with suction and pressed well on the funnel to remove water and traces of nitrobenzene. The yield of crude product varies from 270 to 340 g. (60–75 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 51.5–52° and boils at 117–118°/9 mm. This product is satisfactory for most purposes. If a purer material is desired, the crude m-bromonitrobenzene may be distilled under reduced pressure. The recovery on purification is about 85 per cent. Brühl recorded the b.p. as 138°/18 mm. and the m.p. as 56° for pure m-bromonitrobenzene.1
The ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate obtained is transferred immediately to a 1-l. beaker fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. Water (250 ml.) is added, and the temperature is raised to 30°. A solution of 28.4 g. (0.30 mole) of chloroacetic acid in 30 ml. of water is neutralized with sodium carbonate [18.6 g. (0.15 mole) of Na2CO3·H2O in 70 ml. of water] and is added to the well-stirred dithiocarbamate suspension over a 10-minute period. In the beginning the suspension gradually becomes less viscous, but at the end of the addition it rapidly turns into a creamy mass. Another 250 ml. of water is added to facilitate stirring, which is continued for 1 hour after the addition at about 30°.
C. 3-n-Heptyl-5-cyanocytosine. In a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 33.8 g. (0.145 mole) of 3-n-heptylureidomethylenemalononitrile and 70 ml. of methanol; then 8.5 g. (0.16 mole) of sodium methoxide is added carefully in small portions. The resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 days in the stoppered flask. The contents of the flask are dissolved in 300 ml. of cold water in an 800-ml. beaker, and the solution is stirred as 11 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added. The precipitated solid is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel and washed with three 40-ml. portions of distilled water. The undried product is dissolved in 600 ml. of hot ethyl alcohol; then the solution is filtered into a 1-l. flask by gravity through a fluted filter paper, concentrated on the steam bath to 200 ml., and cooled in the refrigerator for 4 hours. The 3-n-heptyl-5-cyanocytosine crystallizes in white needles, melts at 192–197°, and amounts to 29.7–31.1 g. (88–92%).
The reaction mixture is poured cautiously into 800 g. of crushed ice and acidified in the cold by the addition of 400 ml. of 10 N sulfuric acid. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried over 100 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the filtered solution is fractionated. The portion boiling at 103–107° is collected; any low-boiling fraction is dried and redistilled. The total yield is 135–155 g. (40–46%) of a colorless product that boils at 103–107°,, and.
The ether layer is separated and combined with a 200-cc. ether extract of the aqueous layer. The combined ether solution is washed once with about 100 cc. of water and then dried by shaking for a few minutes with about 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration, the ether is distilled on a water bath. When practically all the ether has been removed, about 5 g. of sodium, freshly cut and in thin slices, is added and the mixture is boiled for about two hours. The solution is decanted and then distilled, using an efficient fractionating column. The fraction boiling at 190–210° is collected. This on redistillation yields 74–88 g. (50–59 per cent of the theoretical amount) of n-amylbenzene boiling at 198–202°.
A. N-[2,4-Bis(1,3-diphenylimidazolidin-2-yl)-5-hydroxyphenyl]acetamide. A 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer is charged with 88.8 g (0.2 mol) of 1,1',3,3'-tetraphenyl-2,2'-biimidazolidinylidene and 30.2 g (0.2 mol) of 3-acetamidophenol. The system is flushed with and maintained under nitrogen, and 100 mL of chlorobenzene is added. The suspension is stirred at 100°C for 6 hr. 2-Propanol (250 mL) is added to the hot mixture, which is then allowed to cool to room temperature. A pale-yellow solid precipitates which is filtered and washed with 200 mL of 2-propanol. Drying in vacuum affords 84.6–93.2 g (71–78%) of N-[2,4-bis(1,3-diphenylimidazolidin-2-yl)-5-hydroxyphenyl]acetamide, mp 254–256°C.
The solution is cooled, then washed successively with two 500-ml. portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution, one 500-ml. portion of water, and one 100-ml. portion of saturated sodium chloride solution. The wash solutions are extracted successively with one 100-ml. portion of benzene, which is added to the main benzene solution. After removal of the benzene the ester is distilled at atmospheric pressure through a 30-cm. asbestos-wrapped Vigreux column, the fraction boiling at 166–170°, nD2 1.4295, being collected. The yield of colorless product is 257–260 g. (93–95%).
To this well-stirred mixture is added 58 cc. of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution over a period of one-half to three-quarters of an hour. This may be added drop by drop from a separatory funnel or in portions of a few cubic centimeters. The addition of the alkali causes the formation of a yellow precipitate which, on being stirred into the benzene, reacts with the benzene and gives p-bromobiphenyl. If too much of this reactive "oxide" is precipitated at one time, some of it may decompose to a dark brown product. The alkali is, therefore, added at such a rate that the amount of precipitate is at no time greater than can readily react with the benzene, and the stirring must be efficient. The temperature during the reaction is kept at about 5°; when all the alkali has been added, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature.
In a 1-l. conical flask are placed 52 g. (about 0.15 mole) of the equimolecular mixture of 5-nitro-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione (p. 656) and sodium sulfate, 200 ml. of water, and 75 ml. of 15 N ammonium hydroxide solution (sp. gr. 0.90). The flask is stoppered and shaken until all, or very nearly all, of the solid has dissolved, and 84 g. (0.4 mole) of sodium hydrosulfite dihydrate is added in three portions. The solution becomes hot, the temperature sometimes reaching the boiling point, and the dark orange-red color begins to fade. After the spontaneous reaction has subsided the solution is boiled gently for a few minutes and filtered to remove insoluble impurities. The filtrate is heated on a steam bath or over a small flame for 30 minutes. During this time the 5-amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione begins to separate as a light-yellow flocculent precipitate or as a crust adhering to the walls of the flask. The hot solution is made distinctly acid to litmus paper with glacial acetic acid and allowed to stand overnight. The yellow precipitate is separated by filtration, washed well with cold water, and dried in a hot-air oven at 110° or below. The dry material weighs 25–27 g. and melts with decomposition at 301–305°.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer are mixed 385 g. (335 cc., 3.8 moles) of 95 per cent furfural (p. 280) and 3 l. of water. Then 500 g. (630 cc., 8.6 moles) of acetone is added. The mixture is stirred and cooled to 10° and to it is added 75 cc. of 33 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, whereupon some heat is generated. Without cooling, the stirring is continued for four hours. At the end of this time 10 per cent sulfuric acid is added until the mixture is acid to litmus (about 350 cc.). The two layers which have formed are separated and the upper aqueous layer is distilled under ordinary pressure until the distillate no longer forms two layers.
Thirty-five grams (0.27 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309) is suspended in 125 cc. of hot water in a 400-cc. beaker and stirred by hand during the addition of 85 g. (0.87 mole) of potassium acetate. The mixture is boiled five minutes and then cooled to about 70°; 75 cc. of alcohol is added, and the solid is filtered with suction and washed with 75 cc. of hot alcohol. The filtered hydrazine solution is saved for the next step.
The fragmentation is conveniently performed in a 100-ml., wide-necked, round-bottomed flask with a side arm. The side arm is equipped with a capillary fitted with a balloon filled with argon or nitrogen. The capillary should be set so that it does not dip into the reaction mixture. The reaction flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a short assembly for distillation under reduced pressure. A dropping funnel extends through the stillhead to a level about that of the neck of the flask, and the receiver is cooled in an ice bath. A trap is positioned between the receiver and the vacuum source and cooled in a 2-propanol–dry ice mixture. The reaction flask is immersed in an oil bath at 150–155°, and the apparatus is evacuated to a pressure of 11 mm. The crude hydrazone mixture is dissolved in 20 ml. of diethyl phthalate and carefully added in small portions, from the funnel, into the heated flask, with the stirrer in operation. There is a rapid evolution of nitrogen, and 5-hexynal begins to distil. Addition of the entire hydrazone solution requires approximately 2 hours, after which the funnel is washed with 5 ml. of diethyl phthalate, and the temperature of the reaction flask is raised to 160–165°. The reaction is complete when there is no further evolution of nitrogen. The last traces of product can be driven into the receiver by warming the stillhead with a heat gun.
The solvent is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, first at atmospheric pressure and finally at reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residue is satisfactory for the preparation of 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone described below (part B). Distillation through the column gives, after a small fore-run, 243–248 g. (83–85%) of colorless 2-chloro-2-methylcyclohexanone, b.p. 94–96°/27mm., nD25 1.4672, d425 1.088.
B. Mandelic acid. In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer, is placed 156 g. (3.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 1.4 l. of water. The solution is warmed to 60°, vigorous stirring is begun, and 200 g. (1.06 moles) of dichloroacetophenone (either crude or distilled) is added from the dropping funnel. The dichloroacetophenone is added slowly at first so that the temperature does not exceed 65°. The addition requires about 2 hours. Stirring is continued for 1 hour longer while the temperature is maintained at 65° by means of a water or steam bath. After addition of 170 ml. of 12 M hydrochloric acid, the solution is extracted with ether. The continuous extractor shown in Fig. 18 is very useful for this purpose. About 250–300 ml. of ether is used, and the extraction is continued until no more material is obtained. With this apparatus, about 130 g. of crude mandelic acid is recovered after 24 hours, and 150 g. after 48 hours. The volume of liquid in the larger flask must be great enough so that, when 250–300 ml. of ether is used for the extraction, there will be a continuous overflow from the larger to the smaller flask; the latter serves as the "boiler."
A suspension of potassium tert-butoxide is prepared by a slight modification of the procedure of Johnson and Schneider,2 particular attention being paid to the precautions they recommend for safe handling of potassium. Dry tert-butyl alcohol (1250 ml.) is distilled directly into the reaction flask under nitrogen. One hundred grams (2.6 g. atoms) of potassium cut into about ten pieces is added. The stirred mixture spontaneously warms to the melting point of potassium (62°) in the course of 15–60 minutes, whereupon the metal disperses into droplets. As the potassium gradually dissolves, the temperature of the mixture rises to the boiling point of tert-butyl alcohol. The rate of solution of the potassium should be such that the tert-butyl alcohol refluxes gently, and this rate is regulated by the speed of stirring. If the boiling becomes too vigorous, the stirring is stopped completely, and if necessary the reaction vessel is cooled by immersion in a bath of cold oil kept in readiness for this purpose. Potassium tert-butoxide gradually precipitates, and the mixture is a thick suspension when all the potassium has reacted.
The reaction mixture is cooled to about 100°, washed out of the flask with 5 l. of hot water, and acidified to a pH between 2 and 3 with 1.4 l. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the docosanedioic acid that has precipitated is collected on a 25-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is suspended in 5 l. of water with mechanical stirring and collected on the Büchner funnel as before. The moist filter cake is dissolved in 700 ml. of hot 2-methoxyethanol, the hot solution is filtrate through a fluted paper in a heated funnel, and the filtrate is gradually cooled to 0–5°. The docosanedioic acid that crystallizes out is separated on a Büchner funnel, pressed as dry as possible, and suspended in 500 ml. of 95% ethanol with mechanical stirring. The acid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with a little 95% ethanol, dried in air, and pulverized. The colorless docosanedioic acid thus obtained weighs 127–133 g. (69–72%, based on 1-morpholino-1-cyclohexene) and is nearly pure; m.p. 124–126°; neutralization equivalent 181–184 (calculated, 185) and.
In the flask A are placed 750 g. (6.3 atoms) of granulated tin and 1500 cc. of commercial hydrochloric acid (about 28 per cent). The mixture is heated until the action is vigorous. The thiocarbonyl perchloride is run in from the funnel T. The resulting reaction is very violent. The vapors are condensed in the series of condensers and in the scrubber L through which xylene is allowed to flow slowly from the separatory funnel N. Most of the crude thiophosgene collects in F, although a small amount is obtained from the distillation of the xylene wash liquid.
The residue is transferred to a 250-cc. modified Claisen flask and distilled under diminished pressure from an oil bath. There is almost no low-boiling fraction if the alcohol has been carefully removed. The yield of product boiling at 122–124°/11 mm. is 130–140 g. (65–70 per cent of the theoretical amount) and. A small amount of black solid remains in the distillation flask after the pyridone has distilled.
The checkers have used the following method with success for obtaining a completely anhydrous product. The allyl alcohol obtained after one salting out with potassium carbonate is distilled as indicated above to give a product of about 70 per cent purity and then mixed with one-quarter of its volume of carbon tetrachloride. The mixture is then slowly distilled from a round-bottomed flask fitted with a fractionating column at least 80 cm. long, collecting the low-boiling mixture of carbon tetrachloride, water, and allyl alcohol, drying it with potassium carbonate, and returning it to the flask. This process is repeated several times, until only very little water passes over. The mixture is then completely distilled, taking the following cuts: Up to 80°, 80–90°, 90–95°, 95.5–97°, the last being alcohol which titrates 100 per cent pure. The lower fractions are dried separately and refractionated, thus giving an additional portion boiling at 95.5–97°.
The solvent is removed by distillation from the steam bath, the final traces under 10–30 mm. pressure. The flask is allowed to cool with a calcium chloride tube attached, and the product is crushed with a spatula and transferred to bottles sealed against moisture. The yield is 394–418 g. (80–85%) of a white or slightly gray solid.
The liquid is decanted from the solid, and the solid is washed with 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The carbon tetrachloride layers are combined and 2 g. of hydroquinone is added. The solution is then distilled from a Claisen flask at such a pressure as to maintain a distillation temperature of about 30°. When most of the solvent has been removed it is discarded, and the residue is distilled as rapidly as possible until the temperature reaches about 90° at 5 mm. Redistillation from a Claisen flask with a short Vigreux side arm gives a colorless liquid; yield 55–65 g. (54–64%); b.p. 96–98°/20 mm.; n25D 1.4619.
After 20 hours at reflux, the mixture is cooled to room temperature with a water bath and poured with vigorous stirring into 500 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium carbonate contained in a 1-l. separatory funnel. The benzene layer is washed successively with two 250-ml. portions of 10% aqueous potassium carbonate and 250 ml. of brine containing potassium carbonate, dried over sodium sulfate for 10 minutes, and filtered. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator with a 25–35° water bath provides a solid yellow residue, which is dried under vacuum.
The reaction mixture is stirred for one hour after all the cyanide has been added and then is allowed to stand overnight. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous liquor is extracted with six 300-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and the ether is distilled. The residue, which consists mainly of acetone cyanohydrin, is diluted with 800 cc. of methyl alcohol. The solution is cooled and saturated with ammonia gas. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for two or three days, and the excess ammonia is expelled by a current of air. The methyl alcohol is removed by distillation as completely as possible, and 600 cc. of water is added to the residue. Then 1 kg. of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid is added and the mixture is refluxed for two hours.
A. Maleanilic acid. In a 5-l. three-necked flask provided with a paddle-type stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel are placed 196 g. (2 moles) of maleic anhydride and 2.5 l. of ethyl ether. The stirrer is started and, when all the maleic anhydride has dissolved, a solution of 182 ml. (186 g., 2 moles) of aniline in 200 ml. of ether is run in through the dropping funnel. The resulting thick suspension is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour and is then cooled to 15–20° in an ice bath. The product is obtained by suction filtration. It is a fine, cream-colored powder, m.p. 201–202°, suitable for use in the next step without purification. The yield is 371–374 g. (97–98%).
Ethyl (2Z)-3-bromopropenoate. To a three-necked, round-bottomed flask are added lithium bromide (10.0 g, 0.115 mol,), acetonitrile (100 mL,), acetic acid (7.0 g, 0.116 mol,), and ethyl 2-propynoate (9.0 g, 0.092 mol,,) under nitrogen. The reaction is carried out with magnetic stirring under reflux and monitored by GLC. The reaction is complete after 24 hr. The reaction is cooled, water (20 mL) is added to the flask, and the mixture is cautiously neutralized with solid potassium carbonate, added in portions. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic layers are dried with magnesium sulfate and filtered. After removal of the solvent, ethyl (2Z)-3-bromopropenoate is obtained by vacuum distillation (14.0 g, yield, 85%,).
In a 3-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 500-cc. separatory funnel are placed 1.7 l. of dry benzene and 160 g. (1.2 moles) of powdered, anhydrous aluminum chloride. The mixture is cooled to 10° by means of an ice-water bath and maintained at 10–20° during the addition of a solution of 120 g. (0.58 mole) of benzalacetophenone in 300 cc. of dry benzene. This addition requires about thirty minutes. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring continued at room temperature until all the dense, yellow precipitate formed at first has gone into solution. The reaction is complete after stirring for an additional hour.
D. Imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde.3 A solution of 19.1 g (0.05 mol) of dry, unrecrystallized 2-(1,3-dibenzoylimidazolidin-2-yl) imidazole hydrochloride in 200 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid is refluxed for 22 hr. The mixture is then chilled on ice, causing deposition of benzoic acid, which is removed by filtration. The filtrate, on evaporation, leaves a residue that is first digested with 100 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol and then cooled on ice. The remaining solids are essentially pure ethylenediamine dihydrochloride and are filtered off. Filtrate solvent is again removed under reduced pressure to leave solid residue. This is dissolved in 40 mL of water. Addition of solid sodium bicarbonate until foaming ceases causes imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde to crystallize. The mixture is chilled on ice, and the product is filtered and washed with ice-water to give, after thorough drying, 3.2–3.7 g (67–77%) of beige crystals, mp 206–207°C. Analytical material, prepared from water, has mp 206–207°C.
B. n-Butyl 4-chlorophenyl sulfide . A 1-L, single-necked, pear-shaped flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and septum, is charged with 4-chlorophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (17.6 g, 67.5 mmol), palladium acetate [Pd(OAc)2, (0.9 g, 4.1 mmol)], and toluene (425 mL),. A nitrogen source is introduced through a 12-in., 16-gauge needle, which is punctured through the septum and submerged into the mixture. A second 16-gauge needle leading to a bubbler is punctured through the septum. The mixture is stirred while vigorously purging with nitrogen for 15 min. The septum is opened briefly to introduce [(R)-Tol-BINAP, (3.1 g, 4.5 mmol, Note 9)], and the mixture is stirred for 15 min with continuous purging with nitrogen, yielding a homogenous orange solution.
In a 1-L, three-necked flask fitted with a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed 45.9 g (0.30 mol) of methyl bromoacetate and 75 mL of tetrahydrofuran and the mixture is cooled to −78°C in an inert atmosphere.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with an upright condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mercury-sealed stirrer, are placed 400 cc. of dry xylene and 13 g. (0.56 gram atom) of sodium. The flask is heated in an oil bath until the sodium melts, and the mixture is stirred until the sodium is broken up into fine globules. Then 69 g. (0.57 mole) of methyl malonate is added over a period of five to ten minutes.
A 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a T-tube connected to a source of pure nitrogen. The remaining joint of the T-tube is connected to a bubbling device so that the rate of nitrogen flow can be observed throughout the course of the reaction. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 30 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide and 2.4 g. of about 50% sodium hydride in oil (ca. 0.05 mole). Stirring is begun and the contents of the flask are heated to 75° for 30 minutes under a slight pressure of nitrogen. The flask is cooled in a water bath to 30°, before a solution of 4.45 g. (0.0250 mole) of diphenylacetylene in 20 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide is added dropwise with stirring to the dark-gray solution. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture gradually rises until it approaches 40°. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is heated to 65° and held at this temperature for 2.5 hours. The resulting red-brown reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured into 500 ml. of an ice and water mixture with stirring. After the ice has melted, the mixture is extracted with five 150 ml. portions of diethyl ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with three 100-ml. portions of water, then dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation at reduced pressure, and the product (about 6.0 g.) is chromatographed on 180 g. of alumina. Elution with 1:7 (v/v) benzene:n-hexane gives ten 50-ml. fractions, of which the first two contain nearly all the mineral oil from the sodium hydride reagent. Fractions 3 through 8 are combined, and the ether is removed by distillation, yielding 1.2–1.4 g. (22–25%) of slightly impure 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene. Recrystallization from methanol gives 0.55–0.70 g. (10.7–13.6%) of pure 2,3-diphenyl-1,3-butadiene, m.p. 47–48°.
The receiver is now changed, the lower thermometer is raised from the liquid, and the contents of the flask distilled as rapidly as possible. Heating is continued until the tarry residue begins to foam; towards the end of the distillation the color of the vapor becomes deep yellow with a greenish fluorescence. The distillate weighs 165–170 g.; it is poured while still molten into a cold dish and allowed to cool, ground in a mortar with 100 cc. of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide, and warmed on the steam bath for ten to fifteen minutes with 400 cc. of this solution. When cold, the xanthone is filtered off, washed free of alkali, and dried. A small amount of low-melting impurity is removed by boiling for ten to fifteen minutes with 250 cc. of methyl alcohol, cooling, filtering, and washing with the same solvent. A few grams can be recovered from the filtrate. The product melting at 170–172°, after softening slightly at 168–170°, weighs 141–145 g. (61–63 per cent of the theoretical amount). It is pure enough for the preparation of xanthydrol (p. 554). A purer product can be obtained by recrystallization from twenty parts of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, from which it separates as pale yellow needles, melting at 173–174°.
A solution of 125 g. (0.88 mole) of 1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]decane in 200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added at a rate to cause gentle refluxing. The ice-salt bath is replaced by a steam bath, and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 3 hours. The calcium chloride drying tube is removed, and the steam bath is replaced by an ice bath. The excess hydride is carefully destroyed by adding water dropwise until hydrogen is no longer evolved; about 12 ml. of water is needed. This is followed by the more rapid addition of 1 l. of 10% sulfuric acid and then 400 ml. of water. This combination dissolves all the inorganic salts formed and results in the formation of two clear layers. The ether layer is separated in a 3-l. separatory funnel, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed successively with 200 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 200 ml. of saturated brine. The ethereal solution is dried overnight over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered through a fluted filter paper, and concentrated by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, a pale yellow liquid weighing about 130 g., is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure. 2-Cyclohexyloxyethanol is obtained as a colorless liquid, b.p. 96–98° (13 mm.), weight 105–119 g. (83–94%), n25D 1.4600–1.4610.
The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and a solution of 58 g. (51 cc., 0.53 mole) of freshly distilled ethyl chloroformate (b.p. 92.5–93.5°) in 100 cc. of absolute ether is added dropwise in the course of one-half hour. The mixture is heated on the steam bath for one and one-half hours and then allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.
B. 3-Methyl-2-pentyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one (Dihydrojasmone). 2,5-Undecanedione (92.1 g, 0.5 mol) is added to a solution of 16.0 g (0.4 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 800 mL of water and 200 mL of ethanol in a 2000-mL round-bottomed flask. The mixture is refluxed for 6 hr, cooled to room temperature, and extracted with ether. The combined ether phases are dried with magnesium sulfate, and the solution is separated from the drying agent and concentrated at room temperature under reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled through a 30-cm Vigreux column. the pure compound boils at 65–67°C/0.5 mm and weighs 70–73 g (84–88% based on the diketone).
A solution of 4-bromotoluene (8.55 g, 50 mmol, 1 equiv) in toluene (300 mL) is added under a steady flow of argon to the reaction mixture, and the glassware is rinsed with degassed toluene (30 mL). The obtained brown-orange suspension is immersed in the oil bath. Stirring (700 rpm) is commenced and the heating source is turned on (set to 125 °C). The mixture starts to reflux after approximately 45 min.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 75-cm. Liebig condenser is placed 210 g. of potassium hydroxide (purified with alcohol) dissolved in 1.5 l. of anhydrous methyl alcohol. The solution is cooled to below 50°, 300 g. of purified ethyl formate is added, and the mixture is refluxed for two hours and.
(B) Preparation of the Reducing Agent.—One hundred and twenty-six grams (0.505 mole) of hydrated cupric sulfate is dissolved in 500 cc. of water in a 2-l. beaker and 210 cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added. The solution is then cooled to 10°. A solution of 42 g. (0.256 mole) of commercial hydroxylammonium sulfate in 120 cc. of water is prepared and cooled to 10°; to this latter solution there is added 85 cc. of 6 N sodium hydroxide solution, and the resulting solution of hydroxylamine is then filtered by suction if not clear. The hydroxylamine solution is immediately added to the ammoniacal cupric sulfate solution with hand stirring. Reduction occurs at once; a gas is evolved during the process, and the solution becomes pale blue in color. If this solution is not to be used at once it should be protected from the air.
To a magnetically stirred solution of 6.36 g. (0.0157 mole) of crude α,α'-dibromodibenzyl sulfone (m.p. 135–150°; Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 403 (1988)) in 40 ml. of dichloromethane contained in a 100-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser there is added in one portion 5.05 g. (0.0500 mole) of triethylamine. The solution is heated at reflux with stirring for 3 hours, filtered, and the precipitate washed with 5 ml. of cold (0°) dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane solution is washed with two 20-ml. portions of 3 N hydrochloric acid followed by one 10-ml. portion of water. Removal of the solvent by distillation from a water bath at 30° with the aid of a water aspirator gives 3.0 g. (80%) of the vinylene sulfone as a tan solid, m.p. 116–126° (dec.). The crude solid is washed with 5 ml. of cold (0°) ethanol and recrystallized from about 10 ml. of benzene, yielding 2.4–2.5 g. (63–67%) of the pure sulfone as tiny, snow-white needles, m.p. 123–126° (dec.).
Twenty grams of acetamide (0.34 mole) is dissolved in 54 g. of bromine (0.34 mole) contained in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and the solution is cooled to 0–5° in an ice bath. An ice-cold aqueous 50% potassium hydroxide solution is added in small portions with swirling and cooling until the color becomes a light yellow. Approximately 33–34 ml. of the caustic solution is required. The nearly solid reaction mixture is allowed to stand at 0–5° for 2–3 hours.
A. (S)-N-Formyl-O-tert-butylvalinol (1). In a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, 20.6 g (200 mmol) of (S)-valinol and 16 g (216 mmol) of ethyl formate are heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 1 hr. Excess ethyl formate is removed under reduced pressure and the oil is triturated with dry ether until a yellow solid appears. This material is dissolved in 260 mL of dry dioxane in a 1000-mL pressure bottle equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and immersed in an ice–water bath. The bottle is immediately charged with ca. 260 mL of liquid isobutene and 75 mL of boron trifluoride etherate is rapidly added. The pressure bottle is sealed with a stopper, removed from the ice bath, and stirred at room temperature for 3 hr. In a fume hood, excess isobutene is removed from the resulting clear solution by carefully cracking the seal of the stopper. When the gas ceases to discharge, the stopper is removed and the solution is poured into a 1000-mL separatory funnel containing 250 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide and is extracted twice with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The organic layer is washed with 100 mL of brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The organic solvent is removed and the residue is distilled (Kugelrohr tube, 0.05 mm, 80–85°C bath temperature) to give 27–36 g (75–95%) of N-formyl-O-tert-butylvalinol (1) as a clear oil.
A 500-mL oven-dried Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum is charged with palladium(II) acetate (342 mg, 1.5 mmol, 0.05 equiv), sodium acetate (1.23 g, 15 mmol, 0.50 equiv), n-butyldi-1-adamantylphosphine (576 mg, 1.5 mmol, 0.05 equiv), and tribasic potassium phosphate (6.36 g, 30 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The Schlenk flask is evacuated and back-filled with dry argon three times. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylacetamide (120 mL), 2-isobutylthiazole (4.25 mL, 30 mmol, 1.00 equiv), and chlorobenzene (4.5 mL, 45 mmol, 1.50 equiv) are added via a gas tight syringe. Under a continuous flow of argon the rubber septum is quickly replaced with a reflux condenser and bubbler to ensure an air-free system. The mixture is stirred in a preheated oil bath at 125 °C for 36 h. A continuous argon flow is maintained throughout the reaction. The yellow color of the reaction mixture changes to dark brown after 5-10 min of heating. Potassium phosphate does not dissolve and a mild reflux is observed. The conversion is monitored by GC. If complete conversion is not achieved after 36 h, the reaction mixture is heated for an additional 2-4 h.
For purification, it is dissolved in 9–9.5 l. of boiling benzene. The solution is filtered rapidly, using a 32-cm. folded filter in an 8-in. short-stem glass funnel. The recovery is 59–70 g. The fine, white crystals, which melt at 169–170°, are stored in a brown glass bottle under nitrogen,,.
A. 2-(Ethoxycarbonyl)prop-2-en-1-yl phenyl sulfone (1).2 Ethyl methacrylate (7.50 mL, 60 mmol) and absolute ethanol (120 mL) are added to a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper, a thermometer, and an argon inlet adaptor. The mixture is cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath, the stopper is removed, iodine (18.1 g, 71 mmol) and benzenesulfinic acid sodium salt (22.7 g, 126 mmol) are added with the aid of a plastic funnel, and the stopper is replaced. The temperature of the mixture increases to 6–7 °C upon addition of the sodium salt. The reaction mixture is recooled to 0 °C and stirred for 5 h, then allowed to warm to room temperature. Dichloromethane (100 mL) is added and the dark brown reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with water (2 × 100 mL), and the water is back-extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 25 mL). The combined organic layer is washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (100 mL) and sodium dithionite (5% solution, 2 × 100 mL). The resulting yellow solution is dried over MgSO4, filtered into a 250-mL, one-neck, round-bottomed flask and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 500 mbar) to yield 22.58–22.68 g (98-99%) crude adduct as a dark oil.
Two hundred grams (1.72 moles) of freshly distilled dry n-caproic acid is placed in a 1-l. flask with 300 g. (96 cc., 1.88 moles) of bromine which has been dried by washing once with 200 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. A 3-cc. portion of phosphorus trichloride is cautiously added and the flask connected to a reflux condenser, the top of which is connected with a trap and absorption bottle containing water. The mixture is then heated in a water or oil bath to 65–70°, at which temperature the reaction commences and hydrogen bromide is given off smoothly. After five to six hours, the bromine has all reacted. Towards the end of the reaction, the temperature is allowed to rise to about 100°. The contents of the flask are now distilled under diminished pressure. The fraction boiling at 132–140°/15 mm. is collected and weighs 280–298 g. (83–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mixture is now boiled in a 3-l. flask, the vapors being passed through an efficient condenser and the condensed liquid run into an automatic separator (p. 422) so arranged that the heavy liquid is returned to the flask and the lighter aqueous liquid discarded. If the boiling is sufficiently vigorous no more water will separate after two to two and one-half hours' boiling. The reaction mixture is now cooled, washed with dilute sodium carbonate solution, and distilled with the use of a column until the temperature of the vapor reaches 85° and that of the liquid in the flask about 115°. The residue is then transferred to a flask provided with a column for distillation under reduced pressure (Fig. 9, p. 130) and distilled. The fraction boiling at 60–65°/15 mm. is collected, 690–700 g. of pure ethyl β-bromopropionate being obtained (85–87 per cent of the theoretical amount). A high-boiling residue, probably consisting of ethyl hydracrylate, remains in the flask, but the amount is practically negligible.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 74 g. (0.5 mole) of phthalic anhydride and 30 ml. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled monoethanolamine. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 30 minutes; the initial reaction is vigorous. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and a reflux condenser is attached to the flask. To the cooled reaction mixture is added slowly, with shaking, 32 ml. (91.3 g., 0.34 mole) of freshly distilled phosphorus tribromide. The reaction flask is then placed on a steam bath and heated under reflux with occasional shaking for 1.25 hours. The hot liquid reaction mixture is poured with stirring onto 750 g. of crushed ice. When the ice has melted completely, the crude β-bromoethylphthalimide is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with cold water, and allowed to dry for a few minutes. The crude product is dissolved in 1.2 l. of aqueous ethanol (50% by volume) with the aid of heat. If necessary a small amount of 95% ethanol is added to effect complete solution. The hot solution is filtered and cooled in a refrigerator. A white crystalline product weighing 94–99 g. is obtained. Concentration of the mother liquor to 400 ml. yields an additional 1–3 g. of product. The total yield of product is 95–102 g. (75–80%); m.p. 80–82°.
E. 2,3,6-Tricarboethoxypyridine. A 50-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. Triethyl 1,2,4-triazine-3,5,6-tricarboxylate (1.49 g, 5.0 mmol) and chloroform (22.7 mL.) are added to the reaction vessel. N-Vinyl-2-pyrrolidone (2.22 g, 20 mmol, 2.3 mL,) is added to the solution and the reaction mixture is warmed at 60°C under an atmosphere of nitrogen for 26 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the crude product subjected to gravity chromatography on a 2.7 × 32-cm column of silica gel (40–50% ether–hexane gradient elution), collecting 50-mL fractions. The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (50% ether–hexane eluant). The fractions containing product are combined and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to afford 1.01–1.35 g (68–92%) of 2,3,6-tricarboethoxypyridine as a yellow oil.
After crystallization has begun, 100 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is stirred in, care being taken not to precipitate any appreciable amount of gum. Crystallization is allowed to become complete in a cool place, occasionally stirring with a heavy rod. After about two days the crystalline arabinose is filtered off and washed with 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. To secure further crops of arabinose from the mother liquor and washings, the solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure on the boiling-water bath, and the residual gum dissolved in 200 cc. of hot methyl alcohol. The solution is cooled, seeded with arabinose if necessary, set in the refrigerator for at least one day and the arabinose filtered off.
B. Diethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride. The crude diethyl aminomalonate is diluted with 80 ml. of dry ether and filtered to remove a small amount of white solid. The filtrate is collected in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and cooled in an ice bath. Dry hydrogen chloride is passed just over the solution while it is being stirred mechanically. The fine white crystals which precipitate are collected by suction filtration and washed three times with a total of 60 ml. of dry ether. The filtrate and washings are treated again with hydrogen chloride, and a second crop of diethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride is collected and washed as before. This process is repeated until no further precipitation results from passing hydrogen chloride into the solution. A total of 16.5–17.4 g. (78–82% yield based on diethyl malonate) of diethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride, m.p. 162–163°, is obtained. Recrystallization from alcohol-ether affords a purer product, 164–165°.
While the naphthol is dissolving, a solution of benzenediazonium chloride is prepared. In a 3-l. wide-mouthed bottle are placed 128 g. (125 cc., 1.38 moles) of aniline and 1.5 kg. of cracked ice, and upon this mixture while it is stirred (by hand) is poured 410 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (31.5 per cent; sp. gr. 1.16). Some crystals of aniline hydrochloride separate at this point. A solution of 100 g. (1.45 moles) of sodium nitrite in 200 cc. of water is now run in slowly from a 500-cc. separatory funnel. The tip of the stem of the separatory funnel should dip well below the surface of the liquid. The mixture is stirred (by hand if desired) and a drop is tested from time to time with starch-iodide paper. This is best done by diluting the test-drop on a watch glass with about 1 cc. of water and then placing a drop of this solution on the starch-iodide paper. The sodium nitrite solution is added until there is a test for nitrous acid which is permanent for five minutes. The diazotization is then complete; all but 2–5 per cent of the nitrite is required.
One hundred fifteen grams (0.9 mole) of p-chlorophenol, 300 g. (2.0 moles) of phthalic anhydride, 50 g. of crystallized boric acid, and 2 kg. (1090 cc.) of 95 per cent sulfuric acid are thoroughly mixed in a 1.5-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is then immersed to the neck in an oil bath and the temperature gradually raised to 200° during the course of one-half to three-quarters of an hour. It is then kept constant at 200° for three and one-half hours. Owing to the tendency of the phthalic anhydride to sublime, the mouth of the flask is covered with a piece of porous plate. When cool, the colored melt is poured slowly into 5 l. of cold water with continuous stirring, and filtered. The precipitate is boiled with 10 l. of water and filtered hot to remove the excess of phthalic anhydride which goes into solution. The residue is then suspended in 10 l. of boiling water, and to this suspension is added a sufficient quantity of 10 N potassium hydroxide solution to produce a purple color (about 30 cc.), followed by 300 cc. more. The alkaline solution is filtered hot, and the residue (about 5–10 g.) is washed with 200 cc. of hot 2 per cent potassium hydroxide solution and discarded.
A. Methyl hydrogen succinate. A mixture of 400 g. (4 moles) of succinic anhydride and 194 ml. (4.8 moles) of methanol in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is refluxed on a steam bath. After about 35 minutes the mixture is swirled frequently until it becomes homogeneous (this requires 15–30 minutes); the flask is then half immersed in the steam bath for an additional 30–25 minutes.
B. 1-Trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[4.1.0]heptane. A 250 ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser bearing a nitrogen inlet at its top, and a rubber septum. The apparatus is purged with nitrogen, flamed dry, and allowed to cool. The flask is charged with 130 ml. of diethyl ether, 17.0 g. (0.100 mole) of 1-trimethylsilyloxycyclohexene, and 18.5 g. (0.146 mole) of diethylzinc, each being added through the septum with a syringe. The solution is stirred and maintained at room temperature with a water bath while 40.2 g. (0.150 mole) of diiodomethane is added slowly from the dropping funnel over a 1-hour period. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 8 hours. After the reaction is complete, the contents of the flask are stirred and cooled in an ice-water bath as 5.4 ml. of concentrated aqueous ammonium chloride is added over ca. 30 minutes. A large amount of gas is evolved, and a white solid is formed during the hydrolysis. The salts are separated by filtering through a sintered-glass Büchner funnel and washed with 100 ml. of a 1:1 (v/v) ether–pentane solution. The combined filtrates are washed with four 50-ml. portions of ice-cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and two 100-ml. portions of ice-cold aqueous sodium chloride. The solution is filtered through a pad of anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated. The residual liquid is distilled through a 17.5-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure, affording a forerun of 2.1–3.5 g., b.p. 65–80° (12 mm.), and 14.2–15.2 g. (77–83%) of 1-trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[4.1.0]heptane, b.p. 80–82° (12 mm.).
A. Diethyl propionylsuccinate (1). A solution of 412 g. (2.40 mole) of diethyl maleate, 278 g. (4.79 mole) of freshly distilled propionaldehyde, and 1.2 g. (0.0048 mole) of benzoyl peroxide in a normal, 2-l. Pyrex flask is heated under reflux while undergoing irradiation with a UV lamp. The initial reflux temperature is 60°. After 2 hours another 1.2 g. of benzoyl peroxide is added. Strong reflux and irradiation are maintained throughout the entire reaction period. After 18 hours of reflux, the internal pot temperature reaches 68°, at which point the last 1.2 g. of benzoyl peroxide is added. The reaction is continued for a total of 30 hours, at which time the pot temperature reaches 74.5°. The reflux condenser is then replaced with a distillation head, and the excess propionaldehyde (119 g.) is distilled under atmospheric pressure, b.p. 48–49°. Succinate 1 is distilled under reduced pressure. The main fraction, b.p. 145–151.5° (15–16 mm), provides 417–449 g. (75–81%) of product having sufficient purity for use in the next step.
B. Benzohydroxamoyl chloride. A four-necked flask equipped with a rubber-sealed stirrer, a thermometer, an inlet tube, and an outlet tube attached to a calcium chloride tube and containing a solution of 50 g. (0.41 mole) of benzaldoxime in 450 ml. of pure chloroform is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. When the temperature of the solution reaches −2°, stirring is started and a stream of chlorine gas is passed through at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 2°. After 1 hour the passage of chlorine is stopped and the greenish yellow solution is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is then connected to an aspirator to remove most of the dissolved chlorine. The light yellow solution thus obtained is stripped of the solvent at 40° under reduced pressure. The almost colorless residual liquid is dissolved in 150 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°) and cooled, with scratching, in a dry ice-acetone bath, whereupon a colorless crystalline solid starts separating. The cooling is continued for 30 minutes and the solid is then filtered, washed with 50 ml. of cold petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°), pressed to remove most of the adhering mother liquor, and dried over a filter paper. The yield of benzohydroxamoyl chloride, m.p. 48–52°, which is pure enough for the next step, is 33–38 g. (51–59%).
After the sulfuric acid has been added and the spontaneous heating of the reaction mixture has subsided, the mixture is heated to gentle boiling for about one-half hour. When the reaction mixture has cooled, 2 l. of water is added, the cooled solution is filtered through a cloth filter, and the product washed with about 1 l. of water. In order to remove the chromium salts as completely as possible, the crude p-nitrobenzoic acid is warmed on the water bath and agitated with 1 l. of dilute (5 per cent) sulfuric acid solution. After cooling, the product is again filtered. It is then dissolved in 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, filtered from any chromium hydroxide remaining, and also from unchanged nitrotoluene. The filtrate, which should be light yellow or greenish in color, is acidified with dilute sulfuric acid, with stirring. It is usually preferable to run the alkaline solution into the dilute sulfuric acid, rather than to use the reverse procedure, for the precipitation of the nitro acid. The precipitated product is filtered with suction, washed thoroughly, and dried. The product should have only a light lemon color. The yield is 230–240 g. (82–86 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 1,2-Cyclononadiene. A dry 2-l. three-necked flask is equipped with mechanical stirrer, pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet tube connected to a gas-trap arrangement. To the flask are added 187 g. (116 ml., 0.66 mole) of 9,9-dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane and 100 ml. of anhydrous ether. The dropping funnel is charged with 450 ml. of 1.9M ether solution of methyllithium (0.85 mole). The flask is cooled by means of an acetone-dry ice bath maintained at −30° to −40°, and the methyllithium is added dropwise with stirring during 1 hour. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, and excess lithium reagent is decomposed by dropwise addition of 100 ml. of water. An additional 400 ml. of water is then added, and the ether layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 30-ml. portions of water until neutral and dried over magnesium sulfate. The latter is filtered and the ether is distilled through a 40-cm Vigreux column. Distillation of the residue yields 66–73 g. (81–91%) of 1,2-cyclononadiene, b.p. 62–63° (16 mm.), n20D 1.5060.
Ethyl (R)-2-azidopropionate . An oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with an overhead stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and an immersion thermometer. The flask is charged with ethyl S-(−)-lactate (19.2 mL, 0.169 mol), tetrahydrofuran (175 mL), and diphenylphosphoryl azide (40 mL, 0.185 mol). The mixture is cooled to 2°C in an ice-water bath. To the mixture is added 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) (24 mL, 0.157 mol) dropwise via syringe. (Caution: The DBU addition causes an exotherm. The reaction temperature is maintained below 5°C by carefully controlling the rate of addition. For this reaction the addition required 35 min). A thick white precipitate forms during the DBU charge. The reaction is stirred at 1°C for 1 hr, and then it is warmed to room temperature and stirred under nitrogen for 24 hr. The resulting homogeneous reaction is diluted with methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, 170 mL), and water (100 mL) is added. After the water layer is removed, the organic phase is washed with water (100 mL) and 0.5 M citric acid monohydrate (100 mL). The organic layer is dried ( Na2SO4 ) and concentrated under reduced pressure to ca. 40-50 g of a pale yellow oil. The product is purified by simple distillation to afford 12.84 g (57%) of a clear, colorless oil, bp 83−88°C/50mm, and.
The dry silica is loaded onto a chromatography column (pre-packed with a slurry of 260 g of silica gel in a 40% ethyl acetate/hexanes mixture), and the product is eluted using the same solvent mixture. Collection of 25 mL fractions begins immediately, and product-containing fractions (as determined by TLC analysis) are combined in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated in vacuo using a rotary evaporator (37 °C bath, 10 mm Hg) to give a viscous, pale yellow oil. This oil is then transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask using successive rinses of dichloromethane (100 mL total volume). Evaporation of solvent (rotary evaporator followed by 12 h under high vacuum) provides the purified [5+2] cycloadduct 2 as an off-white, powdery solid, mp = 71-73 °C (6.84 g, 90% yield). The submitters report 95-96% yield (7.2-7.3 g) of 2 (mp = 71-72 °C) using freshly prepared 1-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1-vinylcyclopropane.
A. 2-Propargyloxytetrahydropyran . An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large football-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, an argon inlet adapter, and an oven-dried, 200-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel sealed with a rubber septum. The flask is charged sequentially with 0.116 g (0.500 mmol) of (±)-camphorsulfonic acid, 750 mL of dichloromethane, and 29.4 mL (0.500 mol) of propargyl alcohol under an argon atmosphere. The flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, and a solution of 50.2 mL (0.550 mol) of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran in 75 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 2 hr. Upon completion of the addition, the ice-water bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 23°C. After 2 hr at 23°C, the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase is separated and washed with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by distillation through a 15-cm Vigreux column at reduced pressure (13 mm) to afford 67.0 g (96%) of 2-propargyloxytetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid.
A. erythro-2,3-Butanediol monomesylate. A 2-l., round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1-l. dropping funnel attached to a calcium chloride drying tube. A magnetic stirring bar is placed in the flask and a solution of 48.0 g. (0.500 mole) of methanesulfonic acid in 500 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added. Stirring is begun, and the flask is cooled in an ice-water bath while a solution of 37 g. (0.52 mole) of trans-2-butene oxide and in 500 ml. of anhydrous ether is added over a period of 3–4 hours. After 6 hours the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred an additional 12 hours. The ether and any excess epoxide are removed with a rotary evaporator at 25° and water aspirator pressure, giving 83–84 g. (99–100%) of erythro-2,3-butanediol monomesylate as a clear, colorless, somewhat viscous liquid.
To a stirred suspension of 105 g. (0.372 mole) of the alkoxide, 34.7 g. (31.0 ml., 0.186 mole) of diphenyl sulfide is added by syringe. Bromine, 29.9 g. (9.6 ml., 0.186 mole), is then added by syringe over a 5-minute period, giving a red-brown mixture which gradually fades to a pale yellow within 30 minutes. Stirring is continued at room temperature for 2.5 hours, leaving a pale-yellow solution and a copious precipitate of potassium bromide containing some potassium alkoxide.
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask 54 g. (0.5 mole) of o-phenylenediamine is treated with 32 cc. (34.6 g.) of 90 per cent formic acid (0.75 mole). The mixture is heated in a water bath at 100° for two hours. After cooling, 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added slowly, with thorough mixing by rotation of the flask, until the mixture is just alkaline to litmus. The crude benzimidazole is collected with suction in a 75-mm. Büchner funnel; ice-cold water is used to rinse all solid out of the reaction flask. The crude product is pressed thoroughly on the filter, washed with about 50 cc. of cold water, and then purified without previous drying.
The flask is heated by an oil bath to 150° (bath temperature), at which temperature the solution starts to boil and butyl chloride begins to distil. After a few moments, it is necessary to control the temperature in the reflux condenser at 75–80° by a very slow stream of water. The temperature of the oil bath is gradually raised to 155°, and one hour from the time of initial boiling practically all the butyl chloride has distilled. If necessary, however, heating at 155° may be continued for ten to fifteen minutes longer and the temperature of the bath then raised to 160–165°, the reflux temperature not being allowed to get above 80°. The distillate is washed with 100 cc. of cold water, 50 cc. of cold concentrated sulfuric acid (in four portions), 10 cc. of water, and finally with 25 cc. of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution. It is dried over 10 g. of calcium chloride and distilled and. The fraction boiling from 75.5° to 77.5° weighs 352–361 g. (76–78 per cent of the theoretical amount)..
B. 2,2-(Trimethylenedithio)cyclohexanone. A solution of 3.02 g. (0.0200 mole) of freshly distilled 1-pyrrolidinocyclohexene, 8.32 g. (0.0200 mole) of trimethylene dithiotosylate4, and 5 ml. of triethylamine in 40 ml. of anhydrous acetonitrile, is refluxed for 12 hours in a 100-ml., round-bottom flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is treated with 100 ml. of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid for 30 minutes at 50°. The mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and extracted with three 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 10% aqueous potassium hydrogen carbonate solution, until the aqueous layer remains basic to litmus, and with saturated sodium chloride solution. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting oily residue is diluted with 1 ml. of benzene then with 3 ml. of cyclohexane. The solution is poured into a chromatographic column (13 × 2.5 cm.), prepared with 50 g. of alumina and 3:1 cyclohexane–benzene. With this solvent system, the desired product moves with the solvent front; the first 250 ml. of eluent contains 95% of the total product. Elution with an additional 175 ml. of solvent removes the remainder. The combined fractions are evaporated, and the pale-yellow, oily residue crystallizes readily on standing. Recrystallization of this material from pentane gives 1.82 g. (45% yield) of white, crystalline 2,2-(trimethylenedithio)cyclohexanone, m.p. 52–55°.
The furnace is heated to 300–340°, and 204 g. (195 ml., 2 moles) of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol is introduced from the dropping funnel at the rate of 50 ml. per hour. The product, collected in an Erlenmeyer flask which contains 30 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, consists of a light-brown oil and a lower aqueous layer. When the reaction tube has drained, the lower aqueous layer is separated and discarded. The upper layer is fractionated through a short column, and a fraction boiling at 70–86° is collected. This consists of a mixture of water and dihydropyran, most of which distils at 83–86°. The residue (25–35 g.) is mainly unchanged tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol.
The reaction mixture is cooled to 5–10° in an ice-salt bath, and, with continued stirring, a solution of 31.7 g. (21.3 ml., 0.250 mole) of oxalyl chloride in 200 ml. of dry carbon disulfide is added through the dropping funnel in the course of 20 minutes. After the addition is complete, the thick black reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, refluxed for 1 hour, and then cooled to 0–5° in an ice bath. The mixture is stirred throughout these steps. One hundred grams of chipped ice is added with stirring, followed by 400 ml. of cold water. Steam is then passed into the flask until the carbon disulfide and unreacted dimethylaniline are removed, and the green-black aluminum complex is decomposed to a mixture of a green solid and a blue solid; this requires 1–2 hours. The mixture is cooled to 50°, and the solid, which is principally 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzil, is collected on a Büchner funnel. In order to remove the major part of the impurity, which is somewhat soluble in water, the solid is slurried in 200 ml. of water at 50°, and the slurry is filtered. This process is repeated twice, and the crude benzil, now a green solid, is washed successively on the funnel with 200 ml. of water at 50° and with 100 ml. of cold methanol. After being dried in air, it weighs 44–55 g. and melts at 191–196°.
The reaction mixture is poured into a 2000-mL separatory funnel containing water (300 mL) and ether (300 mL). After thorough mixing, the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ether (2 × 200 mL). The combined ethereal solutions are washed with water (300 mL) and brine (300 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to leave 8.5 g of a pale yellow oil. This material is subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel using 20% ethyl acetate in hexanes as the mobile phase. The minor diquinane (230 mg,) is eluted first. A mixed fraction of the two isomers follows (570 mg,) in advance of the pure title compound (6.36 g,,).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 3 l. of U.S.P. solvent grade ether, 450 ml. of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, and 0.6 l. of 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is chilled in an ice-salt bath to 0°, and 180 g. (0.5 mole) of N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dinitrosoterephthalamide (70% in mineral oil) is added in one portion. The flask is immediately transferred to a heating mantle and connected by a gooseneck to the condenser. The yellow color of diazomethane appears in the receiver almost immediately. About 2 l. of ether is distilled in 2–2.5 hours; the distilling ether is practically colorless at this point. The tip of the adapter should be kept just below the surface of the distillate during the distillation. The distillate contains 0.76–0.86 mole (76–86%) and of diazomethane as determined by titration.2 When the apparatus has been protected with a drying tube, the diazomethane is suitable for reaction with an acid chloride without further drying.
A solution of 42 g. (1.05 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 360 ml. of water is placed in a 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer and is cooled to −5° in an ice-salt bath. The stirrer is started, and 43 g. (0.263 mole) of bromine is added from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains below 0° (addition time about 5 minutes). The ice-cold solution is diluted with 240 ml. of dioxane that has previously been cooled to 13–14°. This solution is kept at 0° until required.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a drying tube containing Drierite, and a 125-ml. dropping funnel is placed 288 ml. (274 g., 3.74 moles) of freshly distilled dimethylformamide. The flask and its contents are cooled in an ice-salt bath for about 0.5 hour, and 86 ml. (144 g., 0.94 mole) of freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride is subsequently added with stirring to the dimethylformamide over a period of 0.5 hour. The pinkish color of the formylation complex may be observed during this step. The 125-ml. dropping funnel is replaced with a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a solution of 100 g. (0.85 mole) of indole in 100 ml. (95 g., 1.3 moles) of dimethylformamide is added to the yellow solution over a period of 1 hour during which time the temperature should not rise above 10°. Once the solution is well mixed, the dropping funnel is replaced with a thermometer, and the temperature of the viscous solution is brought to 35°. The syrup is stirred efficiently at this temperature for 1 hour, or for 15 minutes longer than is necessary for the clear yellow solution to become an opaque, canary-yellow paste. At the end of the reaction period, 300 g. of crushed ice is added to the paste with careful stirring, producing a clear, cherry-red aqueous solution.
B. 2-Ethyl-3-Quinolinecarboxylic Acid. To the 1000-mL round bottom flask containing 1 is added a mixture of 100 mL of THF and 75 mL of 2 M LiOH (aq) and a football-shaped magnetic stir bar. The flask is capped with a rubber septum, vented with a needle, and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. The THF is then removed by rotary evaporation to provide an aqueous solution of the lithium carboxylate.
To a solution of 24 g. (0.1 mole) of cystine in a cold mixture of 150 ml. of water and 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, dropwise, 80 g. (25 ml., 0.5 mole) of commercial bromine, with occasional stirring, during 40 minutes. The temperature of the mixture rises to about 60°. The resulting solution, which contains a little unreduced bromine, is then evaporated under reduced pressure on a steam bath. The dark-colored crystalline residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of distilled water and filtered from a small quantity of amorphous insoluble matter. The filtrate is concentrated by evaporation on a water bath to 65 ml. and allowed to crystallize by standing overnight in a refrigerator. The crystals are filtered with suction and washed well with about 100 ml. of 95% ethanol in several portions, the washings being collected separately. The crystals are dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide. A second crop is obtained by diluting the washings with an equal volume of water, evaporating until free of ethanol, adding the residue to the mother liquor, and evaporating the combined solution to dryness on the water bath. The residue is dissolved in 30–40 ml. of water, decolorized with 0.5–1.0 g. of charcoal, concentrated to 15 ml., and, when cold, treated with 30 ml. of 95% ethanol. The crystals so formed are collected, washed with ethanol, and dried as before. The total yield is 30.5–33.5 g. of pure cysteic acid monohydrate (81–90%). It melts, with vigorous evolution of gas, at 278° (289° cor.), and shows the rotation [α]54246 + 9.36° (6% in water).
The yield of cupferron based on a given weight of phenylhydroxylamine averages 85–90 per cent of the theoretical amount.
B. Hexahydro-6-ethyl-3-(hydroxymethyl)-6-allyl-2-phenyl[2S,3S,6S,8aR]-5-oxo-5H-oxazolo[3,2-a]pyridine. In an oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is placed 14.4 g (55.2 mmol) of dry bicyclic lactam prepared as described in Part A. The flask is flushed with argon and filled with 150 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and then sealed with a rubber septum. The air in the flask is further replaced by argon. After dissolution of the bicyclic lactam, the flask is cooled in dry ice–acetone and the solution is stirred while preparing lithium diisopropylamide (LDA).
C. (tert-Butyldimethylsilyl)allene . An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large football-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 15.7 g (60.0 mmol) of triphenylphosphine under an argon atmosphere. The flask is sealed with a rubber septum containing a needle adapter to an argon-filled balloon, and 120 mL of THF is added via cannula. The solution is cooled in a −15°C bath, and 9.02 mL (57.5 mmol) of diethyl azodicarboxylate is added via syringe over 2 min, followed immediately by the addition of a solution of 8.52 g (50.0 mmol) of 3-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-2-propyn-1-ol in 18 mL of THF via cannula over 2 min. After an additional 5 min, a solution of 13.0 g (60.0 mmol) of o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl hydrazide in 65 mL of THF is added to the reaction mixture over 5 min via cannula. The resulting orange-red solution is stirred at −15°C for 45 min, after which time the cold mixture is allowed to warm to 23°C and is held at that temperature for 5 hr. During this time, the evolution of dinitrogen is observed. The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 400 mL of pentane , and the resulting mixture is washed with four 500-mL portions of ice-cold water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 0°C. The residue is purified by flash chromatography using a short column of 230-400 mesh silica gel (60 g, packed dry and eluted with pentane). The fractions containing the product are concentrated by rotary evaporation at 0°C to afford 5.38-5.39 g (70%) of (tert-butyldimethylsilyl)allene as a colorless liquid.
B. 2-(2,2-Dibromo-vinyl)-phenylamine (3). A 250-mL Büchi autoclave glass vessel is charged with 1-(2,2-dibromovinyl)-2-nitrobenzene (5.80 g, 18.9 mmol) and methanol (100 mL). The solution is stirred until all of the solid is dissolved, at which point vanadium-doped platinum on activated carbon is added (580 mg, 0.015 mmol, 8.0 × 10-4 equiv). The vessel is attached to the autoclave and pressurized to 2.5 bar with hydrogen. The flask is thrice evacuated (via diaphragm pump) and back-filled with hydrogen to 2.5 bar, then stirred for 3 h at room temperature. The hydrogen is removed by evacuation, and the suspension is filtered through a pad of celite (2.5 cm in height). The pad is washed with methanol (3 × 80 mL), and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 15 mmHg) and dried under vacuum (0.03 mmHg, 16 h) to afford 5.22 g (99.8 %) of the title compound as an orange oil.
In a two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a reflux condenser, the top of which is fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, is placed 7.3 g (ca. 0.13 mol) of 85% pure potassium hydroxide. To the flask are added 4 mL of water and an ethanol solution (60 mL) of the crude ester 2 (ca. 13 g) with a syringe; the mixture is refluxed for 1 hr. The reflux condenser is replaced with a Claisen head and the bulk of the solvent is distilled off over 30 min. The residue is cooled in an ice bath and 80 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid is cautiously introduced. The mixture is extracted with 150 mL of hexane and the organic layer is separated. To the aqueous layer is added 40 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and the solution is again extracted with two 100-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the crude acid 3 (10.6–12.0 g) as a dark-colored oil.
The mixture is filtered by suction in a large funnel. The filtrate has a volume of about 4.5 l. The cake of unchanged zinc dust and zinc compounds is transferred to a 3-l. battery jar and placed under the stirrer, and the latter is clamped in place. water (750 cc.) is added, the stirrer is started, and steam is passed in until the mixture starts to froth too violently. The steam is then shut off, but the stirring is continued for ten minutes. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is added to the main solution in a large evaporating dish. The liquid is evaporated over a large burner to a volume of about 1 l., or until a considerable crust forms around the edges. The mixture is then cooled. Large, flat, transparent crystals separate. The thoroughly cooled mixture is filtered by suction, and the crystals are air-dried until efflorescence just starts. They are then bottled. The product is p-CH3C6H4SO2Na·2H2O. The yield is 360 g. (64 per cent of the theoretical amount). Careful acidification of the mother liquor with dilute hydrochloric acid yields 15 g. of the free sulfinic acid.
To a suspension of 37.4 g. (0.2 mole) of o-chlorophenylthiourea (p. 180) in 300 ml. of water at 100°, contained in a 3-l. beaker, is added a boiling solution of 132 g. (2 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water. The resulting solution is immediately treated with a hot saturated solution of 83.5 g. (0.22 mole) of lead acetate trihydrate, added as rapidly as possible and with good stirring. The reaction mixture, from which large quantities of lead sulfide separate instantly, is boiled for 6 minutes and cooled to 0°, and the lead sulfide is filtered with suction by means of a large Büchner funnel. The colorless filtrate is acidified at 0–5° by the slow addition with stirring of 120–140 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The white crystalline precipitate of nearly pure o-chlorophenylcyanamide which separates is collected by filtration on a suction filter and is washed with six 150-ml. portions of ice water. The crystalline mass of white plates is filtered, drained, and dried. The yield of product, melting at 100–104°, is 26–28 g. (85–92%).
The method for the production of large amounts of hexamethylbenzene is the rapid methylation of pentamethylbenzene or the durene filtrates. A mixture of 378 g. of pentamethylbenzene and 200 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride is heated on an oil bath at 190–200° and a rapid stream of dry methyl chloride is bubbled through for three to four hours, using the same apparatus as for the preparation of durene. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. One liter of hot xylene is added to dissolve the solidified material, and the reaction mixture is decomposed by pouring it onto 3 kg. of chopped ice. The resulting oil is separated, and the xylene and other low-boiling material are removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The fractions are divided as above. Two refractionations and two recrystallizations give 98–121 g. of white crystals, melting at 157–161°.
A. (S)-(−)-α-(1-Naphthyl)ethylamine. A mixture of 58.44 g. (0.1849 mole) of (−)-2,3:4,6-di-O-isopropylidene-2-keto-L-gulonic acid hydrate [(−)-DAG] and 1.7 l. of acetone is placed in a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask. A boiling chip is added, and the mixture is heated to a gentle boil. To the resulting hot solution is added cautiously but rapidly, over a 1-minute period, 34.24 g. (0.2002 mole) of racemic α-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine in 100 ml. of acetone. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for approximately 4 hours. The (−)-amine (−)-DAG salt is filtered with suction, washed with 100 ml. of acetone, and dried in a vacuum oven at 60° to constant weight, yielding 73–76 g. of the crude (−)-amine (−)-DAG salt, m.p. 205–207° (dec.),, [α]D25 −14.2° (c 1.01%, methanol). The crude salt and 4.2 l. of ethanol are placed in a 5-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for about 4 hours, during which time a clear solution is obtained. The condenser is then placed in a descending position and approximately 1.4 l. of the ethanol is distilled at atmospheric pressure, and stirring is continued at room temperature for about 16 hours. The purified salt is collected on a filter and dried to constant weight, yielding 36–37 g. of white needles, m.p. 216–218° (dec.,), [α]D25 −17.5° (c 1.02%, methanol). For recrystallization, the crude salt and 4.0 l. of ethanol are used. Removal of 3.0 l. of the solvent yields 33.5–33.9 g. (75–76%) of pure (−)-amine (−)-DAG salt as white needles, m.p. 219–221° (dec.,), [α]D25 −18.5° (c 0.90%, methanol).
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser attached to a nitrogen inlet. In the flask are placed 29.2 g (0.20 mol) of benzalacetone and 300 mL of dichloromethane. The flask is immersed in a dry ice–methanol bath (−40°C) and 22 mL (0.20 mol) of titanium tetrachloride is slowly added by syringe to the stirred mixture. After 5 min, a solution of 30.2 g (0.26 mol) of allyltrimethylsilane and in 300 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-min period. The resulting red–violet reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min at −40°C, hydrolyzed by addition of 400 mL of H2O, and, after the addition of 500 mL of ethyl ether with stirring, allowed to warm to room temperature. The nearly colorless organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 500-mL portions of ethyl ether. The organic layer and ether extracts are combined and washed successively with 500 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate and 500 mL of saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 6-in. Vigreux column to give 29.2–30.0 g (78–80%) of 4-phenyl-6-hepten-2-one, bp 69–71°C (0.2 mm), nD20 1.5156, as a colorless liquid.
The solid residue is then dissolved in 1 l. of hot water, and the remainder of the solvent is removed by a current of steam. The solution is filtered from a little solid and is then made alkaline to litmus by the addition of 200 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90). The precipitated aminomethylbenzothiazole is filtered and washed with 200 ml. of water. The solid, which melts over the range 123–128°, is dissolved in 300 ml. of hot ethanol, 10 g. of Norit is added, and the hot suspension is filtered. The filtrate is diluted with 500 ml. of hot water, and the mixture is vigorously stirred and quickly chilled. After 30 minutes, the pale yellow granular product is filtered and washed with 150 ml. of 30% ethanol. After drying to constant weight, the product weighs 100–105 g. and melts at 135–136°, with preliminary shrinking at 130–131°. On the addition of 200 ml. of water to the filtrate, a further 5–8 g. of product is recovered, making the total yield 105–110 g. (64–67%).
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice-salt cooling bath, are placed 54 g. (43 cc., 0.71 mole) of carbon disulfide and 90 cc. (1.3 moles) of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9). The stirrer is started, and 56 g. (0.6 mole) of aniline is run into the mixture from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the addition is complete in about twenty minutes. The stirring is continued for thirty minutes after all the aniline has been added, and then the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for another thirty minutes. During this time a heavy precipitate of ammonium phenyldithiocarbamate separates and may even stop the stirrer.
A. 1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1). A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large Teflon-covered magnetic stir bar, 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, Dimroth condenser fitted with a drying tube, and a glass stopper. The flask is charged with 9.72 g (0.400 mol) of magnesium turnings, 70 mL of hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA), 11.25 mL (0.100 mol) of 1,2-dichlorobenzene, and 0.254 g (1.00 mmol) of iodine (I2). The addition funnel is charged with 51.0 mL (0.400 mol) of freshly distilled chlorotrimethylsilane. The flask is immersed in an oil bath at 70°C, stirring is initiated, and chlorotrimethylsilane is added slowly, dropwise with vigorous stirring. After completion of the addition, the oil bath is heated to 100°C and the reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 2 days. During this time, the reaction mixture becomes viscous and finally separates into two phases. The reaction mixture is cooled to ca. 40°C and poured into a 1-L beaker containing saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution (200 mL), diethyl ether (100 mL), and ice (ca. 100 g). Solids and unreacted magnesium metal are separated by suction filtration, the filtrate is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 150-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with water (500 mL) and saturated sodium chloride (500 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , and filtered. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue is distilled from a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask with a magnetic stir bar through a 20-cm Vigreux column at reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 128-133°C (20 mm) is collected to afford 16.5-16.7 g (74-75%) of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene (1) as a colorless liquid.
(D) Dimethylglyoxime.—The crude biacetyl monoxime remaining after distilling to 90°, and containing about 5 moles of biacetyl monoxime, is added to the sodium hydroxylamine monosulfonate solution (which has been filtered to remove any sediment) and which is contained in a 15-l. flask. It is heated to 70° and allowed to remain warm (with occasional stirring) for several hours. The dimethylglyoxime separates in crystals which can be filtered from the solution as soon as it has become cold. The crystals are washed with cold water until free of sulfate. The yield of compound melting at 238–240° is 540–575 g.
A. Carbobenzyloxy-L-asparaginyl-L-leucine methyl ester. A mixture of 2.024 g. (0.00800 mole) of N-ethyl-5-phenylisoxazolium-3'-sulfonate and 20 ml. of nitromethane is prepared in a 50-ml., glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask and stirred vigorously, at room temperature, with a magnetic stirrer. A solution of 2.128 g. (0.00800 mole) of carbobenzyloxy-L-asparagine and 810 mg. (0.00802 mole) of triethylamine and in 15 ml. of nitromethane) is added. Stirring is continued until dissolution of the isoxazolium salt is practically complete, giving a pale yellow solution (ca. 8 minutes is required;, before 1.452 g. (0.00800 mole) of L-leucine methyl ester hydrochloride is added, followed by a solution of 810 mg. (0.00802 mole) of triethylamine in 5 ml. of nitromethane. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, during which time some solid may separate from the solution. The mixture is then transferred to a 100-ml., round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is triturated with warm (ca. 60°) aqueous 0.5% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and the resulting suspension is cooled and allowed to stand at 5° for at least 4 hours. The precipitate is collected on a filter, washed thoroughly with a total of 25 ml. of cold water, and dried, leaving 2.36–2.65 g. (75–84%) of the crude peptide, which melts within the range of 168–178°. Recrystallization from acetone–water provides 2.09–2.21 g. (66–70%) of pure carbobenzyloxy-L-asparaginyl-L-leucine methyl ester as fine, colorless crystals, m.p. 175–176.3°, [α]24D −27.7° (c 1.0, methanol).
A. 2-tert-Butoxycarbonylamino-4-(2,2-dimethyl-4,6-dioxo-[1,3]dioxan-5-yl)-4-oxo-butyric acid tert-butyl ester. A one-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a three-way stopcock fitted with a rubber septum and an argon inlet is charged with 15.0 g (51.85 mmol) of N-α-tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-aspartic acid α-tert-butyl ester (Boc-L-Asp-Ot-Bu) and 150 mL of dichloromethane. The resulting solution is cooled in an ice bath at 0 °C (ice bath temperature) whereupon 7.85 g (54.44 mmol, 1.05 equiv) of 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid) and 9.50 g (77.78 mmol, 1.5 equiv) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) are added. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochoride (EDC·HCl) (14.91 g, 77.78 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is then added portion-wise to the reaction mixture at 0 °C over 5 min. The three-way adapter is returned to the neck and reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred under argon for 3 h. The solution is diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane before being transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and is then washed successively with two, 150-mL portions of 1 M aq KHSO4 solution and 150 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 (25–30 g), then is filtered through a cotton plug in a funnel, collected in a 500-mL flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 6 mm Hg) to provide 21.5 g of crude 2 as a clear, pale-yellow oil.
A. (R)-2,2'-Bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy)-1,1'-binaphthyl (2). A dry, 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 30-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and flushed with nitrogen gas. The flask is charged with 14.3 g (50.0 mmol) of (R)-(+)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (1), 12.0 mL (148 mmol) of pyridine, and 100 mL of dichloromethane, and the entire mixture is cooled to 0°C with an ice-water bath. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, (20.0 mL, 33.5 g, 119 mmol) is added dropwise over a period of 10 min to the stirred solution. After the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 6 hr, the reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual brown oil is diluted with 200 mL of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with 5% hydrochloric acid (70 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (70 mL), and saturated sodium chloride (70 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is chromatographed (10 × 20 cm column) on silica gel (700 g). The column is eluted with dichloromethane and the fractions are analyzed by TLC on silica gel using 30% dichloromethane-hexane as eluant. Fractions containing the product are combined and the solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator to give 26.3 g (96%) of 2 as a white powder.
The catalyst is removed by filtration, using an absolute alcohol wash, and the clear filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at a temperature below 50° (water bath). As diethyl aminomalonate is not so stable as its salts, the crude product is converted directly to diethyl aminomalonate hydrochloride.
Five hundred grams (9.35 moles) of technical ammonium chloride and 1330 g. (14.8 moles) of paraformaldehyde are thoroughly mixed and placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a long reflux condenser (a jacket of about 100-cm. length and an inner tube of about 2-cm. diameter). By means of an oil bath, the temperature of the reaction mixture is gradually raised. Between 85° and 105° liquefaction begins to take place at the bottom of the flask, and at the same time a very vigorous evolution of carbon dioxide starts. The heat is at once withdrawn, and if the reaction is too violent, the oil bath should be removed. The reaction is allowed to continue without further heating until the gas evolution is less vigorous. This requires about one and one-half hours. Heat is again applied and the temperature of the bath raised to about 160°, where it is held until there is practically no more evolution of carbon dioxide. This takes two and one-half to three and one-half hours, after which time the reaction is complete.
A. 3,5-Dichlorosulfanilamide. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a two-holed stopper carrying a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, are placed 50 g. (0.29 mole) of sulfanilamide and 500 ml. of water. About 50 ml. of a 500-ml. portion (approximately 6 moles) of pure concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is stirred until a clear solution results. The remainder of the 500 ml. of hydrochloric acid is then added. If the internal temperature does not rise to 45°, the stirred solution should be warmed gently with a free flame until this temperature is reached. At this point 65 g. (59 ml., 0.58 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide (sp. gr. 1.108) is added and rapid stirring is initiated. The heat of reaction causes a progressively faster rise in temperature. After 5 minutes the solution fills with a white precipitate which increases rapidly in amount and becomes delicately colored. When the temperature has reached 60°, about 10 minutes after adding the peroxide, any further rise is preferably prevented by judicious cooling. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 15 minutes more at 60°, and then an ice bath is raised about the flask while stirring is continued. When the temperature has fallen to 25–30°, the mixture is filtered at once. The yield of 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide is 45–50 g. (65–71%), and the crude dusky pink product melts over a range of 1–2° in the region 200–205°.
(C) Sodium Hydroxylamine Monosulfonate.—In a 12-l. crock are mixed 5 kg. of shaved ice and 569 g. of sodium nitrite (594 g. of the technical 95 per cent quality). Into this is stirred a suspension of sodium bisulfite containing 1.1 kg. of available sulfur dioxide (about 1775 g. of technical bisulfite) in 750 cc. of water. Then, beneath the surface of the solution is added, with constant stirring, 150 cc. of glacial acetic acid followed by a mixture of 550 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with 400 g. of shaved ice. The entire solution should always remain below 0°, further ice being added if there is a tendency for the temperature to rise. The solution should now become acid to Congo red paper and contain 6 or more moles of the sodium hydroxylamine disulfonate, which rapidly hydrolyzes to an acid solution of the monosulfonate.
The filtrate is poured into a solution containing 185 g. (0.76 mole) of crystallized barium chloride dissolved in 600 cc. of hot water. Barium arsonoacetate, Ba (O2CCH2AsO3Ba)2 (hydrated), forms a thick, finely divided precipitate. The mixture is stirred for several minutes and then allowed to stand until the following day, when it is filtered upon a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with water. The yield of air-dried product is 220 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask attached to a modified Dean and Stark constant water separator1 which is connected to a reflux condenser are placed 67.8 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate, 56.8 g. (0.66 mole) of diethyl ketone, 9.2 g. (0.12 mole) of ammonium acetate, 30 g. (0.48 mole) of glacial acetic acid, and 100 ml. of benzene. The flask is heated in an oil bath at 160–165°, and the water that distils out of the mixture with the refluxing benzene is removed from the separator at intervals. Refluxing is continued for 24 hours (several hours after the separation of water has ceased).
