Dimethylsulfoxonium (S)-2-oxo-3-(Boc-amino)-4-phenylbutylide (2). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar, a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen outlet, and a rubber septum through which is inserted a temperature probe. The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min and is then charged with trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (33.0 g, 150 mmol), which is added through a neck that is temporarily opened, and 150 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, which is added by syringe through a septum. A 1.0 M solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL, 150 mmol) is added via syringe through a septum, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h. The resulting solution of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (containing precipitated potassium iodide) is cooled to 0 °C. The reflux condenser is replaced with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of Boc-L-phenylalanine 4-nitrophenyl ester (1) (19.3 g, 50.0 mmol) in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and capped with a nitrogen outlet. The solution is added dropwise over 20 min so that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The flask is briefly opened by temporary removal of the addition funnel to allow addition of 50 mL of water and stirring is continued for 15 min at 0 °C. After warming to room temperature, the mixture is filtered through a short pad (3 mm) of Celite on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The concentrated mixture is rinsed into a 1-L separatory funnel with 200 mL of water and extracted with one 200-mL portion and two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are washed with one 50-mL portion of water and two 50-mL portions of brine. (In some cases solid product separates during the first extraction, but it redissolves when the organic phases are combined.) The solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford 2 as a light yellow solid (15.3–15.4 g, 90–91%), which is carried on to the next step without further purification.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: phthalic anhydride & type: pure & mole: 0.67 mole & mass: 100 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: phenylacetic acid & type: pure & mole: 0.8 mole & mass: 110 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: sodium acetate. & type: pure & mass: 2.6 g. & note: freshly &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: porous plate & type: mixture & mass: A few chips &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: 230°; & [ distill ] N/A: distillation & DESCRIPTION: In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask with a short neck (not longer than 3 cm.) are placed 100 g. (0.67 mole) of phthalic anhydride, 110 g. (0.8 mole) of phenylacetic acid (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), and 2.6 g. of freshly fused sodium acetate. A few chips of porous plate are added, and the flask is provided with a cork bearing a thermometer, which reaches almost to the bottom, and a wide, bent glass tube leading to a condenser. The tube ends just at the lower edge of the cork and does not protrude into the neck of the flask. The flask is imbedded up to the neck in a sand bath and is heated rapidly until the thermometer reaches 230°; then the temperature is raised slowly until the water produced in the reaction and some entrained organic matter pass out through the exit tube. The water is collected in a small vessel and its quantity noted from time to time in order to follow the progress of the reaction. The operation should be conducted so that the temperature rises from 230 to 240° in the course of about two hours. The reaction is maintained at 240° until the distillation of water ceases; this requires about one additional hour.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sulfuric acid & type: pure & volume: 500 cc. & mole: 3.6 moles & concentration: 50 per cent & speed: slowly &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: alkali & type: pure & mole: 6.25 moles &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: to boiling & [ distill ] N/A: distilled. & [ distill ] N/A: redistilled & DESCRIPTION: Through the separatory funnel is added slowly 500 cc. of 50 per cent (sp. gr. 1.40) sulfuric acid (3.6 moles), which is somewhat more than the amount required to neutralize the alkali (6.25 moles) used in the saponification of the ester. When the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases to be vigorous, the reaction mixture is heated slowly to boiling, and from one-third to one-half of the total volume is distilled. The distillate is made alkaline with solid sodium hydroxide and redistilled until 80–90 per cent has been collected.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium & type: pure &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: methyl crotonate & type: pure & mole: 0.60 mole & mass: 60 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: diethyl malonate & type: pure & mole: 0.72 mole & mass: 115 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: methyl crotonate & type: pure & mole: 0.60 mole & mass: 60 g. &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: under reflux & time: 1 hour & [ distill ] N/A: distilling & [ distill ] N/A: Distillation & [ evaporate ] N/A: distilled. & DESCRIPTION: After all the sodium has dissolved, a mixture of 115 g. (0.72 mole) of diethyl malonate and 60 g. (0.60 mole) of methyl crotonate is added from the separatory funnel. This addition is made as rapidly as is consistent with keeping the exothermic reaction under control. After the exothermic reaction has subsided, the mixture is heated for 1 hour under reflux with stirring. An oil bath is recommended for heating. At the end of the heating period the condenser is changed to a position for distilling, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised sufficiently to distil alcohol fairly rapidly from the stirred mixture. Distillation is continued until most of the alcohol has been distilled. There is left a residue of the sodio derivative of triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate. If water is added to obtain the free ester, considerable heat is generated and cooling must be adequate to prevent partial hydrolysis of the ester by the alkali liberated. For present purposes there is no advantage in attempting isolation of the ester, and the residue is processed as described below.

About one-tenth of 230 g. (about 1.1 moles) of technical sodium hydrosulfite is added cautiously and the mixture is stirred until the froth subsides; the remainder is then added without delay. The yellow material which first separates (probably the hydrazo compound) soon is converted into the nearly colorless aminonaphthol. In order to complete the reduction and to give an easily filterable product the mixture is heated strongly until it begins to froth; it is then cooled to 25° by stirring in an ice bath, and the pink or cream-colored product is collected and washed free from the slightly yellow mother liquor with water.

(2.25 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 1.5 l. (17 moles) of benzene (dried over sodium and distilled) is placed in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and, with rapid stirring, the adipyl chloride is added through the dropping funnel at an even rate during the course of forty-five minutes. The reaction mixture darkens slowly but does not become black. After the adipyl chloride has been added, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for two hours at room temperature.

The product is separated from a small amount of water, dried thoroughly over anhydrous calcium chloride, and decanted into a dry distilling flask. A few crystals of potassium iodide are added, and the material is distilled from a water bath. The yield of methyl iodide, boiling at 41–43°, is 615–640 g. (90–94 per cent of the theoretical amount).

The drying tube is removed and the flask is flushed with nitrogen. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. A dropping funnel is attached and charged with 7.45 g (0.04 mol) of 6-oxodecanoic acid, 3.32 g of pyridine, and 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran, which are mixed well by shaking. The flask is charged with 45 mL of acetonitrile and 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran and cooled (methanol–liquid nitrogen) to −30°C. The contents of the funnel are added to the flask at −30°C over 30 min. The reaction mixture is stirred at −30°C for an additional hour and at −20°C for 30 min. After the mixture is cooled to −90°C, 34 mL (0.046 mol) of a 1.35 M solution of lithium tri(tert-butoxy)aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran is injected through the septum by means of a syringe over 30 min, while the internal temperature is kept below −85°C. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 min at −90°C. To the flask is added 50 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid solution, and the cooling bath is immediately removed. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with two 50-mL portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to yield 5.78–6.35 g (85–93%) of 6-oxodecanal as a fragrant liquid, bp 85–90°C (1.4 mm).

Sodium hydride dispersion, [19.2 g. of a 50% w/w suspension in mineral oil, 9.6 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium hydride] is placed in the flask, and 100 ml. of anhydrous pentane is added. After the dispersion has been stirred, the sodium hydride is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is removed with a pipet or a siphon. This washing operation is repeated with two additional 100-ml. portions of pentane, and 400 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide is then added to the reaction flask. To the vigorously stirred suspension of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide is added, dropwise over 30 minutes, 68 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate. The mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained before all of the previously prepared crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate, dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide, is added in one portion. The resulting solution is slowly heated to 100°, with continuous stirring, over a period of 3 hours. During this time the reaction becomes dark red, and crystalline sodium p-toluenesulfonate separates. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, then transferred to a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual semisolid is mixed with 700 ml. of water and extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether.

In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel, 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 2 l. of water and 158 g. (1 mole) of potassium permanganate is then added. The mixture is cooled to 15–20° with an ice-salt bath, and 107 g. (0.75 mole) of 1-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutene is added through the dropping funnel during 1 hour while the permanganate solution is stirred and maintained at 15–20°. After the solution has been stirred for 2 hours more at this temperature, the manganese dioxide is removed by filtration and rinsed with three 300-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to a volume of 500 ml. by evaporation on a steam bath. The solution is then cooled and 85 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly with stirring. The cold solution is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. Drying of the ether extract is accomplished by agitating it for 5 minutes with 30 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. When the drying agent has been removed by filtration and rinsed with ether, the filtrate and the ether washings are combined and concentrated to give 91–97 g. (79–84%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid. The acid is recrystallized by dissolving it in hot nitromethane (1.25 ml. per g.), filtering the solution through a layer of filter aid if necessary, and cooling the solution to 3°. The crystals are collected by suction filtration and rinsed with 30 ml. of cold nitromethane. After drying, this gives 85–92 g. (74–80%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid, m.p. 144–146°.

The system is purged with nitrogen, and the reaction mixture is chilled and maintained at −40°C. The flow of dilute fluorine is started, and the flow rates from the nitrogen and fluorine cylinders are adjusted to introduce a 10% fluorine/90% nitrogen mixture at a rate of 90 mL/min just above the surface of the rapidly stirred solution. When a total of 2.7 L of fluorine (0.12 mol) is introduced, the flow of fluorine is discontinued and nitrogen only is flowed through the system at a rate of 45 mL/min for 30 min while keeping the reaction mixture at −40°C. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the sodium fluoride. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness with a rotary evaporator without heating. The crystalline residue is washed with 30 mL of dry ethyl acetate to give 11.0–12.0 g (74–81%) of crude product, mp 178–181°C. The crude material is dissolved in 18 mL of dry acetonitrile at room temperature, and 36 mL of dry diethyl ether is added. The precipitated crystals are collected by filtration under nitrogen to give 10.0–10.3 g (68–70%) of pure N-fluoropyridinium triflate, mp 182°C,(Note 10),(Note 11).

(E)-1-Dimethylamino-3-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene , 2. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a pressure equalizing addition funnel, a large egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, and a nitrogen/vacuum adapter. The apparatus is evacuated and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with a 1.0 M solution of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaHMDS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (100 mL, 0.100 mol) and the flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−70°C bath temp), causing a viscous, yellowish-white suspension to form. To this suspension is added, over a period of 30 min via an addition funnel, a solution of (E)-4-dimethylamino-3-buten-2-one (11.3 g, 0.100 mol) in THF (50 mL). The funnel is rinsed with a small amount of THF, and the resulting clear-yellow solution is stirred for 1.0 hr at −78°C. A solution of tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane (15.8 g, 0.105 mol) in THF (50 mL) is added over a 5-min period, via an addition funnel. The funnel is again rinsed with a small amount of THF. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to reach room temperature, which requires about 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 600 mL of anhydrous ether. The resulting suspension is allowed to stand for 30 min and then suction filtered through a pad of dry Celite (60 g) packed in a 600-mL sintered glass filter funnel. The filter cake is washed with three 50-mL portions of ether, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (heating bath temp <45°C). The resulting dark orange oil, containing the diene and hexamethyldisilazane, is subjected to bulb-to-bulb distillation (110-120°C, 0.3 mm) to yield 20.4 g (90%) of the desired 1-amino-3-siloxy-1,3-butadiene as a light-yellow oil.

Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal.3 A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a gas inlet, an acetone–dry ice condenser with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets, a stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is placed in an acetone–dry ice bath and anhydrous ammonia is condensed into the flask (400 mL). A small piece of potassium metal (ca. 0.5 g) is added to the liquid ammonia and the cooling bath is removed. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.1 g) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature, at which time the deep blue color turns to gray. The remaining potassium metal (12.2 g, 0.31 g-atom total) is added in 0.5-g pieces over ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until a gray suspension results (20–30 min). A −50°C cooling bath is placed under the flask and the stopper is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalized dropping funnel containing 22.9 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane in 50 mL of anhydrous ether. This solution is added dropwise to the solution of freshly generated potassium amide over 15 min while the temperature is maintained at −50°C. After the solution is stirred for 3 hr at −50° to −60°C, solid ammonium chloride is added slowly to quench the excess potassium amide. The cooling bath is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During the course of the evaporation, anhydrous ether (350 mL total) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace the ammonia. After the temperature has reached 0°C, the brown reaction mixture is filtered by suction through a coarse fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts and the salts are washed twice with 25 mL of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (80–100 mm, 30°C) to constant weight (ca. 4–5 hr). The residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled, short-path distillation head, and the product is distilled (1.25 mm; 30–35°C) into an ice-cooled receiver. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal is obtained as a colorless liquid (6.1–7.8 g, 55–70% yield,).

Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated.

The precipitated p-chloromercuribenzoic acid is difficult to filter because of its flocculent character. It is best to allow it to stand at least overnight and then filter by suction after siphoning most of the clear supernatant liquid. The acid retains much water and should be dried at 110°. The yield is 350–420 g. (61–74 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude acid may be purified by reprecipitation with hydrochloric acid from a solution in sodium hydroxide. The crude acid is sufficiently pure for the preparation of p-iodobenzoic acid (p. 325). It can be used for this purpose without drying.

(182 cc., 3.55 moles) of bromine. The bromination takes place in the cold with separation of the sparingly soluble 9,10-dibromoanthracene; in order to prevent undissolved anthracene from becoming coated over, it is necessary to maintain vigorous stirring throughout the reaction. A tube from the top of the condenser conducts hydrogen bromide to cold water, in which it is absorbed. The addition of the bromine occupies about one-half hour; the rate is so adjusted that a minimum of bromine is carried over with the hydrogen bromide.

(25 cc., 0.187 mole) of pure ethyl isobutyrate. The mixture is shaken, and, after it has stood at room temperature for ten minutes, a solution of 26 g. (21.5 cc., 0.186 mole) of pure benzoyl chloride in 50 cc. of dry ether is added, with shaking. The mixture becomes warm, and a white precipitate of sodium chloride separates immediately. After standing at room temperature for several hours the mixture is heated on a water bath and ether is distilled until the volume is reduced to 300–400 cc. A solution of 5 cc. of acetic acid in 300 cc. of water is added, and the mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel until two homogeneous layers separate on standing. The aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded; the ethereal layer is shaken with 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution and dried over calcium chloride or Drierite. The solution is filtered from the drying agent and distilled on a water bath until most of the ether is removed. The residue is cooled in a refrigerator, and the triphenylmethane which crystallizes is filtered with suction and washed with several small portions of dry ether. The filtrate, after removal of ether, is distilled under reduced pressure and all material boiling up to 180° at 15 mm. collected.

(2.90 moles) of allyl bromide in 2.6 l. of ether is added in small portions until the reaction begins, and then at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing of the ether. The addition requires about 3 hours, after which the reaction mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for an additional hour. Acrolein (104.0 g., 1.86 moles) is added during 2 hours, and this causes gentle refluxing. After an additional hour at room temperature the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 2 l. of ice water. The precipitate is dissolved by adding slowly a solution of 120 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 400 ml. of water. The organic layer is separated and the water layer extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are dried over 8–10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate.

Approximately 30 mL of toluene is removed by rotary evaporation and the residual solution is heated at reflux for an additional 2 days. After the reaction mixture is cooled, it is diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide and 100 mL of brine and the organic layer is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is distilled (Kugelrohr 0.1 mm, 170°C bath temp.) to give 18.0 g (96%) of 2 as a pale-yellow oil.

(2.3 l., 25.6 moles) of benzene, which has been dried by distilling until the distillate comes over clear, and 10 g. of amalgamated aluminum turnings. The benzene is heated to boiling on a steam bath, the steam is turned off, and 500 g. (3.96 moles) of benzyl chloride is added at such a rate as to cause the solution to boil. The hydrogen chloride is absorbed in water or allowed to pass out-of-doors. When all the benzyl chloride has been added (one hour), the mixture is warmed for ten to fifteen minutes, or until the evolution of hydrogen chloride ceases. When cool, the benzene solution of diphenylmethane is decanted from the small amount of tarry material and washed with 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and then with water. After a partial drying with calcium chloride, the benzene is distilled from a steam bath and the residue fractionated under diminished pressure. The fore-run is collected up to 125°/10 mm., the main product at 125–130°/10 mm., and an after-run up to 150°/10 mm.. Redistillation of the fore-run and after-run yields a small amount of material which is added to the main fraction. The latter is chilled and a small amount of oil is decanted from the crystals. The yield of material melting at 24–25° is 330–350 g. (49.5–52.5 per cent of the theoretical amount).

The mixture is treated with stirring with a solution of 186 g. of technical sodium hydroxide or 170 g. (4.25 moles) of c.p. sodium hydroxide in about 300 cc. of water. With continuous stirring 235 g. (1.67 moles) of benzoyl chloride is now added during the course of one hour, keeping the temperature down by cooling with running water. After the addition, the reaction mixture is cooled, the amide separated, washed with a little water and distilled under reduced pressure. The product boils at 180–184° /20 mm., 191–194° /27 mm., 240–244° /130 mm., and weighs 240–250 g. (77–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).

The water condenser is then replaced by a short air-cooled condenser, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. A small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride first distils over, after which the receiver is changed and the temperature rises rapidly to the boiling point of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 197°/73 mm. (155°/20 mm.). During this distillation the oil bath should be kept at a temperature of about 230–250° (or at 210–215° if 20 mm. pressure is used). The yield is 500–534 g. (90–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). The distillate solidifies to a yellow crystalline mass melting at 71°. The product may be recrystallized from ligroin or carbon tetrachloride, from which it separates in fine yellow needles melting at 73°.
INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] N/A: cooling & [ extract ] reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 750 ml. &  )  ( name: ether. & type: pure & volume: 150 ml. &  )  & [ transfer ] N/A: transferred & [ distill ] temperature: 180–200°. & [ evaporate ] N/A: removal & [ distill ] N/A: distillation & [ yield ] yield: 62–67% & mass(yield): 64–69 g. & reagent:  ( name: 2-methoxydiphenyl ether & type: pure & note: crude solid &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ dry ] N/A: dried. & [ yield ] mass(yield): 54–61 g. & reagent:  ( name: 2-methoxydiphenyl ether & type: pure &  )  & DESCRIPTION: After cooling, the products are extracted from the reaction mixture with successive portions of water and ether. Extraction is facilitated by breaking up the solid material with a glass rod. The total amounts. of solvents required are approximately 750 ml. of water and 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether and water solutions are transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and steam-distilled with superheated steam maintained at 180–200°. After removal of the ether, 300 ml. of distillate is collected. This distillate contains the unreacted starting materials. Continued distillation gives 64–69 g. (62–67%) of crude solid 2-methoxydiphenyl ether in 14 l. of distillate. The product is filtered with suction and dried. Crystallization from a mixture of 600 ml. of low-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°) and 435 ml. of higher-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) yields 54–61 g. of 2-methoxydiphenyl ether melting at 77–78°. Other 2-methoxydiphenyl ethers have been prepared by this procedure.
INSTRUCTION: [ evaporate ] temperature: 110–112° & [ transfer ] N/A: transferred & [ evaporate ] pressure: reduced pressure & [ distill ] pressure: 15 mm. & temperature: 114–115° & [ yield ] yield: 89–94 per cent & mass(yield): 410–435 g. & reagent:  ( name: distilled n-butyl borate & note: distilled &  )  & DESCRIPTION: During the third hour of heating, the temperature at the top of the column rises slowly as the removal of the water approaches completion. After the fourth hour, when the temperature of the distilling vapor has attained 110–112°, the heating is discontinued, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-l. Claisen flask with the least possible exposure to atmospheric moisture. The unreacted n-butyl alcohol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure until the thermometer registers a sudden rise in temperature. The receiver is then changed, and the main fraction of n-butyl borate distils almost entirely at 103–105°/8 mm. or 114–115°/15 mm. A negligible residue remains in the distilling flask. The weight of the distilled n-butyl borate, which contains a small amount of n-butyl alcohol, is 410–435 g. (89–94 per cent of the theoretical amount). From the aqueous distillate and the fore-run of the vacuum distillation, 190–210 g. of n-butyl alcohol is recovered.

A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar, a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen outlet, and a rubber septum through which is inserted a temperature probe. The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min and is then charged with trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (33.0 g, 150 mmol), which is added through a neck that is temporarily opened, and 150 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, which is added by syringe through a septum. A 1.0 M solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL, 150 mmol) is added via syringe through a septum, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h. The resulting solution of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (containing precipitated potassium iodide) is cooled to 0 °C. The reflux condenser is replaced with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of Boc-L-phenylalanine 4-nitrophenyl ester (1) (19.3 g, 50.0 mmol) in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and capped with a nitrogen outlet. The solution is added dropwise over 20 min so that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The flask is briefly opened by temporary removal of the addition funnel to allow addition of 50 mL of water and stirring is continued for 15 min at 0 °C. After warming to room temperature, the mixture is filtered through a short pad (3 mm) of Celite on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The concentrated mixture is rinsed into a 1-L separatory funnel with 200 mL of water and extracted with one 200-mL portion and two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are washed with one 50-mL portion of water and two 50-mL portions of brine. (In some cases solid product separates during the first extraction, but it redissolves when the organic phases are combined.) The solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford 2 as a light yellow solid (15.3–15.4 g, 90–91%), which is carried on to the next step without further purification.

The solids are scraped off the walls using a spatula. The flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and charged with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g) and dichloromethane (140 mL). The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and treated sequentially with triethylamine (60.0 mL, 43.6 g, 0.425 mol, 1.5 equiv) and pivaldehyde (95% purity, 35 mL, 28 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.07 equiv corrected for purity). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature. Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 °C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 °C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 °C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.

The apparatus is evacuated (oil pump) and filled with argon (four cycles), and a positive pressure is maintained with an argon-filled balloon on a T-tube. Dry diethyl ether (500 mL) is transferred via cannula into the flask and stirring is commenced. The addition funnel is charged with 60 mL (1.42 M in ether, 0.085 mol) of methyllithium via cannula and rapid dropwise addition is begun. The methyllithium is added over a 15-min period, during which time the solution turns from bright yellow to dark brown. The solution is heated at reflux for approximately 1.5 hr. After the solution is cooled, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The dark-brown residual solid is taken up in 80 mL of water (in air), and 13.0 g (0.088 mol) of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate is added over a 30-min period with stirring. The mixture is extracted several times with 200-mL portions of cold pentane. The combined pentane layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered through a bed of Celite. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation to approximately 60 mL and is cooled to −20°C under argon. After 1 hr the resulting bright-yellow crystals (17.6 g, 83%) are collected and dried at 25°C under reduced pressure for 10 min.

Furyl phosphorodichloridate. A 1-L flask, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube, is charged with 42 g (0.5 mol) of 2(5H)-furanone, 85 g (0.55 mol) of phosphoryl chloride, and 100 mL of methylene chloride. A solution of 65 g (0.5 mol) of ethyldiisopropylamine in 60 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise during 4 hr at ambient temperature. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight (12 hr), after which 6.5 g of the amine in 10 mL of methylene chloride is added in one portion and stirring is continued for 20 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and 200 mL of dry ether is added cautiously, followed by 100 mL of pentane (in that order), to the dark residue to precipitate the amine hydrochloride. The flask is stoppered and shaken for 1–2 min. The hydrochloride is filtered by suction and washed immediately with 100 mL of dry ether and 200 mL of pentane or petroleum ether. The bottle is tightly stoppered and the filtrate is allowed to stand in the refrigerator (+4°C) overnight. The clear brown ethereal phase is decanted from a dark lower phase, and the solvent is evaporated. The residue (ca. 100 g) is distilled at the water pump. In order to obtain pure, color-stable, yellow dichloridate it is usually necessary to distill it twice. The first distillation is done rapidly, collecting the material that boils at 73–98°C (9 mm) to give 65–75 g of product, which usually darkens within a few days and. Redistillation, collecting the material that boils at 91–93°C (22 mm), 88–90°C (16 mm), or 73–76°C (9 mm), gives 60–65 g of pure product. The yield is 60–65%.

To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added vinyltrimethylsilane (28.0 mL, 18.2 g, 181 mmol), methanol (70 mL), and tert-butyl perbenzoate (0.70 mL, 0.70 g, 3.6 mmol),(Note 3),(Note 4). To this solution is added a solution of sodium bisulfite, NaHSO3, (36.1 g, 347 mmol) in 70 mL of water,(Note 6),(Note 7). The flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter bearing an immersion thermometer and reflux condenser, and the resulting suspension is heated in an oil bath at 50°C under argon for 48 hr. The suspension is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and followed by azeotropic removal of the residual water with methanol (2 × 25 mL). Methanol (200 mL) is added to the resulting white solid, and the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously for 10 min. The mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The filter cake is resuspended in 200 mL of methanol and stirred vigorously for 10 min, filtered into the vessel containing the original filtrate, and further concentrated. The preceding operations are repeated again on the filter cake. After the final concentration of the combined filtrates, the resulting white solid is dried (100°C and 0.1 mm) for 12 hr to give 29.0-31.9 g (~78-86%) of crude sodium β-trimethylsilylethanesulfonate as white flakes with mp >310°C.

Dimedone (1,3-Cyclohexanedione, 5,5-dimethyl-) (2.5 g., 0.018 mole) is dissolved in 50 ml. of ethanol by warming. The two solutions are mixed and refluxed for 15 minutes. After cooling to about 25°, the mixture is poured into 500 ml. of water with stirring, and the precipitate is collected, washed with water, and air-dried, yielding 4.4 g. of crude product.

The moist dibromide from 150 g. of cholesterol (part A) is suspended in 2 l. of acetic acid in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and mounted over a bucket of ice and water that later can be raised to immerse the flask. The suspension is stirred at room temperature (25–30°), and a solution, preheated to 90°, of 80 g. (2 oxygen equivalents) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 2 l. of acetic acid is poured in through a funnel. The mixture reaches a temperature of 55–58° during the oxidation, and all the solid dissolves in 3–5 minutes. After another 2 minutes the ice bucket is raised until the flask is immersed; stirring is then stopped, and the mixture is allowed to stand in the ice bath without disturbance for 10 minutes to allow the dibromoketone to separate in easily filterable crystals. With stirring resumed, the temperature is brought to 25° and then, after addition of 400 ml. of water, to 15°. The product is collected on a 21-cm. Büchner funnel, and the filter cake is drained until the flow of filtrate amounts to no more than 25 drops per minute. The suction is released, the walls of the funnel are washed down with methanol, and 200 ml. of methanol is added. After a few minutes' standing, suction is applied and the crystals are drained thoroughly of solvent before they are washed in the same way with 200 ml. of fresh methanol. The last drops of filtrate should be completely colorless. Dried to constant weight at room temperature in a dark cupboard, the dibromoketone consists of shiny white crystals, m.p. 73–75° (dec.), [α]D25 −47° chloroform (c = 2.11); yield about 171 g.

Vigreux column attached to a trap cooled in an acetone–dry ice mixture is charged with 100 ml. of diethyl phthalate and 43 g. (0.30 mole) of tetracyanoethylene oxide. The dropping funnel is charged with 44 g. (0.30 mole) of distilled n-butyl sulfide, the pressure is reduced to 5–20 mm. with a water aspirator, and the reaction flask is warmed with a 50° water bath. The n-butyl sulfide is added dropwise with stirring over 20–25 minutes, and the internal temperature is maintained at 50 ± 2° by controlling the temperature of the water bath. The reaction is exothermic at the start, but it is necessary to supply heat toward the end of the addition. The internal temperature is increased to 80° over 10–15 minutes after the sulfide has been added. The vacuum on the system is released by the introduction of nitrogen. The solid carbonyl cyanide that has collected in the trap is allowed to warm to room temperature under nitrogen, and 2 g. of tetracyanoethylene oxide and a boiling stone are added. The mixture is then warmed to 50°, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure (5–20 mm.) into a second trap cooled in an acetone–dry ice mixture. Another portion of tetracyanoethylene oxide (1 g.) is added to the distillate, and the carbonyl cyanide is distilled, again under reduced pressure (5–20 mm.), into a distillation flask cooled in acetone–dry ice mixture. Fractionation of the distillate through a 20-cm. column packed with glass helices gives 20.8–21.8 g. (86–91%) of faintly yellow carbonyl cyanide, b.p. 65–66°,, and.

INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone & type: pure & mole: 0.0338 mole & mass: 3.85 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: ethylene dithiotosylate & type: pure & mole: 0.025 mole & mass: 10 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: 10 g. of potassium acetate in 150 ml. of methanol. & type: mixture &  )  & [ reflux ] time: 3 hours & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ extract ] reagent:  ( name: diethyl ether. & type: pure & volume: 50-ml. & batch:each: portions &  )  & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: sodium hydroxide & type: pure & concentration: 2 N & note: aqueous & temperature: cold &  ) & reagent:  ( name: sodium chloride. & type: pure & volume: 50 ml. & concentration: saturated & note: aqueous &  )  & phase: ethereal layer & [ dry ] reagent:  ( name: magnesium sulfate & type: pure & note: anhydrous &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ evaporate ] N/A: concentrated & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: benzene & type: pure & volume: 1 ml. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: cyclohexane & type: pure & volume: 3 ml. &  )  & [ transfer ] N/A: transferred & [ column ] reagent(adsorbent): 50 g. of alumina & reagent(eluent): a 3:1 mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. & [ evaporate ] N/A: Evaporation & [ yield ] yield: 57–64% & mass(yield): 2.76–3.04 g. & reagent:  ( name: crude 2,2-(ethylenedithio)cyclohexanone. & type: pure & note: crude & speed: 2,2-(ethylenedithio)cyclohexanone. &  )  & [ recrystallize ] reagent:  ( name: pentane & type: pure & volume: 50 ml. &  )  & [ yield ] appearance: needles & yield: 45–55% & mass(yield): 2.1–2.6 g. & DESCRIPTION: A 300-ml., one-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, the top of which is attached to a nitrogen inlet tube, is charged with 3.85 g. (0.0338 mole) of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, 10 g. (0.025 mole) of ethylene dithiotosylate, and 10 g. of potassium acetate in 150 ml. of methanol. The mixture is refluxed under nitrogen for 3 hours with stirring, the solvent is removed from the reaction mixture on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with cold, aqueous 2 N sodium hydroxide until the aqueous layer is basic to litmus, then with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ethereal layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The oily residue is diluted with 1 ml. of benzene and 3 ml. of cyclohexane and transferred to a chromatographic column (14 × 2 cm.) prepared with 50 g. of alumina and a 3:1 mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. With this solvent system the desired product moves with the solvent front, and the first 100 ml. of eluent contains 85% of the total product. Further elution with approximately 100 ml. of the same solvent mixture removes the rest of the material before a second component begins to come off. Evaporation of the solvent from the combined 200 ml. of eluent leaves an oily residue which crystallizes on standing, yielding 2.76–3.04 g. (57–64%) of crude 2,2-(ethylenedithio)cyclohexanone. Recrystallization from approximately 50 ml. of pentane affords 2.1–2.6 g. (45–55%) of needles, m.p. 56–57°.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: trimethylene cyanide & type: pure & mole: 1.06 moles & mass: 100 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 424 cc. & mole: 4.8 moles & mass: 500 g. &  )  & [ reflux ] time: four hours & [ evaporate ] pressure: reduced pressure. & [ extract ] reagent:  ( name: ether. & type: pure & volume: about 300 cc. & note: boiling &  )  & [ filter ] phase: the residue & [ extract ] reagent:  ( name: ether. & type: pure & volume: 100-cc. & note: boiling & batch:each: portions &  )  & [ evaporate ] N/A: evaporated & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: benzene & type: pure & volume: 1 l. &  )  & [ settemp ] N/A: heated & [ settemp ] temperature: ice-salt bath & [ yield ] mass(yield): 103–105 g.. & [ evaporate ] N/A: concentrated & [ settemp ] N/A: cooled & [ yield ] mass(yield): 13–14 g. & reagent:  name: pure glutaric acid &  )  & [ yield ] yield: 83–85 per cent & mass(yield): 116–119 g. & DESCRIPTION: In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 100 g. (1.06 moles) of trimethylene cyanide (p. 536) and 500 g. (424 cc., 4.8 moles) of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The mixture is refluxed for about four hours and then the solution is evaporated to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. The dry residue, consisting of glutaric acid and ammonium chloride, is extracted with about 300 cc. of boiling ether. The ether solution is filtered and the residue is further extracted with two 100-cc. portions of boiling ether. The combined ether extracts containing the glutaric acid are evaporated to about 150–200 cc., whereupon the acid begins to crystallize. Then 1 l. of benzene is added, and the mixture is heated until the glutaric acid dissolves. On cooling in an ice-salt bath, the acid crystallizes. The first crop weighs 103–105 g.. The filtrate is concentrated to about one-third its original volume and cooled, whereupon a second crop of 13–14 g. of pure glutaric acid is obtained. The total yield is thus 116–119 g. (83–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 97–98°.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: barium hydroxide & type: pure & mass: 700–800 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: mixture & note: well-stirred &  )  & [ filter ] phase: the filtrate & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sulfuric acid & type: pure &  )  & [ wash ] N/A: washed & [ evaporate ] temperature: a steam bath & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium hydroxide & type: pure &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ evaporate ] N/A: evaporated & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: alcohol. & type: pure & volume: 2.5 volumes &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: ice box & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: alcohol & type: pure &  )  & [ dry ] N/A: dried & [ evaporate ] N/A: concentrating & [ yield ] yield: 33 per cent & mass(yield): 252 g. & [ yield ] mass(yield): 240 g. & DESCRIPTION: Finely ground barium hydroxide is added gradually to the well-stirred water solution until the material is slightly alkaline to litmus, in order to remove the excess of arsenic acid; when this point is reached, the solution becomes pink. If the procedure is carried out properly, 700–800 g. of Ba(OH)2·8H2O should suffice. The time required by this method is greater than when a hot solution of barium hydroxide is used, but the method is more convenient and does not cause such a great increase in volume. After removal of the barium arsenate by filtration, the mother liquor and washings are treated with sulfuric acid until the solution contains neither barium nor sulfate ions. When the barium sulfate has been separated and thoroughly washed, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to about 3 l., neutralized to litmus with sodium hydroxide, filtered, evaporated until the solution becomes well coated with crystals, and then treated with 2.5 volumes of alcohol. After the mixture has cooled in an ice box, the sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is separated, washed with alcohol, and dried in an oven at 80°. A second crop may be secured from the filtrate by concentrating it further and precipitating with alcohol. The total yield of anhydrous sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is 252 g. (33 per cent of the theoretical amount). By proper manipulation, it is possible to obtain as much as 240 g. in the first crop and to have it free from sulfate, arsenate, and sodium o-hydroxyphenylarsonate which is one of the by-products formed in this reaction.

(0.292 mole) of succinimide in 1.2 l. of absolute ethanol. A solution of 48.58 g. (0.2860 mole) of silver nitrate in 200 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide is added in one portion. The resulting solution is stirred as 700 ml. (0.280 mole) of 0.400 M sodium ethoxide in ethanol and is added dropwise over 1.5 hours. The off-white silver salt begins to precipitate after ca. 140 ml. of the sodium ethoxide solution has been added. Stirring is continued for 45 minutes after the addition is completed, and the reaction mixture is then stored in a refrigerator at ca. 5° overnight to complete the precipitation and aggregation of the product.

(2.5 moles) of technical dimethylaniline in 1050 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is placed in a large jar or crock and finely divided ice is added until the temperature has fallen to 5°. The contents of the jar are then stirred mechanically, and a solution of 180 g. (2.6 moles) of sodium nitrite in 300 cc. of water is slowly added from a separating funnel, the stem of which dips beneath the surface of the liquid. The addition takes one hour, and the temperature is kept below 8° by the addition of ice if necessary. When all the nitrite has been added the mixture is allowed to stand one hour and then filtered. The solid p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride is washed with 400 cc. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid and then with 100 cc. of alcohol. After drying in air, it weighs 370–410 g. (80–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).

(2.75 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 600 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask, and the solution is cooled to about 5° by the addition of 400 g. of ice. The suspension of the diazonium salt then is added and the mixture is stirred well and allowed to stand without external cooling for one hour. The azo compound soon separates from the red solution and eventually forms a stiff paste.

(0.7 mole) of sodium azide in 150 ml. of water. A mixture of 109 g. (0.5 mole) of lauroyl chloride (b.p. 134–137°/11 mm.) and 150 ml. of acetone is then added from a separatory funnel to the well-stirred solution of the azide at such a rate that the temperature remains at 10–15°. After the mixture has been stirred at this temperature for an hour, the stirrer is stopped and, when the layers have separated, the lower water layer is removed carefully by suction through a glass capillary tube. The upper layer is then added slowly to 500 ml. of benzene which has been warmed to 60°. A rather rapid evolution of gas results, and the mixture is kept at 60–70° until no more nitrogen is evolved; the conversion of azide to isocyanate requires about an hour. The solution is filtered to remove any insoluble matter, and the benzene is removed by distillation from a modified Claisen flask. Distillation of the residue yields 80–85 g. of ester (81–86%) and.

The resulting mixture is stirred at 25–30° for an additional 0.5 hour then filtered to remove triethylamine hydrochloride (13.8 g.). Evaporation of the filtrate under reduced pressure leaves 22–23 g. of light tan needles, m.p. 70–72° (dec.), which is dissolved in 160 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at 30°. On cooling, 20.0–20.6 g. (84–86%) of the inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide precipitates as colorless needles, m.p. 70–72° (dec.).

A solution of 10.0 g (0.143 mol) of racemic 3-butyn-2-ol dissolved in 255 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF,) in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and nitrogen atmosphere is prepared. Dimethylphenylsilane (21.4 g, 0.157 mol) and a small piece of sodium metal (ca. 5 mg) are placed in the reaction mixture. The solution is stirred for 15 min and 12 mg (2.05 × 10−5 mol) of bis(η-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane)tri-tert-butylphosphineplatinum(0) is added. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for 12 hr. The orange solution is cooled to ambient temperature, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield a crude orange residue containing 2a. The oil is subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution 5, 10, 20, 35% EtOAc/hexanes ) providing 25.4 g (123.23 mmol, 86%) of pure 2a as a yellow oil.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 5 l. &  )  & [ settemp ] N/A: stirred & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: hydrogen sulfide & type: pure & volume: a stream of &  )  & [ evaporate ] pressure: reduced pressure & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: Norite. & type: pure & mass: 5 g. &  )  & phase: The filtrate & [ evaporate ] N/A: concentrated & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: alcohol. & type: pure & volume: three volumes & concentration: 95 per cent &  )  & [ settemp ] N/A: cooling & [ filter ] phase: The filtrate & [ yield ] mass(yield): 85–90 g. & DESCRIPTION: The moist histidine-mercury complex is suspended in 5 l. of water and stirred vigorously while a stream of hydrogen sulfide is introduced. When precipitation of mercuric sulfide is complete, the suspension becomes uniformly black and settles sharply on standing. The filtrate and washings from the mercuric sulfide are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 1 l. and cleared with 5 g. of Norite. The filtrate and washings from the Norite are concentrated further to a volume of about 250 cc. and mixed with three volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. Crystallization is induced by cooling the solution and scratching the walls of the vessel; the histidine monohydrochloride separates in plates. After the material has remained in an ice chest for three or four days, the crystals are separated by suction filtration. The yield of crude histidine monohydrochloride is 85–90 g. The filtrate, on standing for several weeks in an ice chest, usually deposits an additional 4–5 g. of material.

A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser protected by a drying tube, a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 101 g. (0.356 mole) of thallium(I) bromide and 400 ml. of anhydrous benzene. The slurry is stirred vigorously while a stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the apparatus.

(687 cc., 9.4 moles) of c.p. glycerol, 218 g. (213 cc., 2.3 moles) of aniline, 170 g. (141 cc., 1.4 moles) of nitrobenzene, and 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The contents of the flask are well mixed and the mixture heated gently over a free flame. As soon as the liquid begins to boil, the flame is removed, since the heat evolved by the reaction is sufficient to keep the mixture boiling for one-half to one hour. If the reaction proceeds too violently at the beginning, the reflux condenser may be assisted by placing a wet towel over the upper part of the flask. When the boiling has ceased the heat is again applied and the mixture boiled for five hours. It is then allowed to cool to about 100° and transferred to a 12-l. flask; the 5-l. flask is rinsed out with a small quantity of water.

While a slow stream of nitrogen continues to pass through the flask, the solution is heated under reflux with high-speed stirring for approximately 10 minutes. During this time most of the sodium reacts without evolution of hydrogen, and the dispersion darkens. The dispersion, which contains some finely divided solids, is cooled and transferred to a 2-l. stirred autoclave under nitrogen. An additional 85 g. (1.00 mole) of piperidine is used to wash the last portions of the dispersion into the autoclave.

The sulfinic acid is dissolved from the filter by a mixture of 750 ml. of ether and 750 ml. of methylene chloride. The solution is dried over calcium chloride and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (bath temperature 25°). The residue is suspended in 50 ml. of water, and small portions of dilute ammonia are added to the well-stirred suspension until it has a pH of 9. Insoluble impurities are separated by filtration, and 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is precipitated from the filtrate by adding 5-ml. portions of 6N hydrochloric acid with cooling; the sulfinic acid precipitated by each portion of acid is separately collected on a Buchner funnel. The acid, a pale yellow solid, is dried on a clay plate in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets, m.p. 120–125° (dec.), weight 9.4–14.9 g. (50–80%). If the 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is to be used for the hydrogenation of the next step high purity is required, and it is generally advisable to reprecipitate the acid once more in the same way.

The mixture is immersed in an oil bath and the temperature of the oil bath gradually increased over about 15 min to 85–100°C, whereupon the solid dissolves and a vigorous, exothermic reaction ensues. When the reaction has subsided, the oil bath is lowered and the condenser is removed. The flask is fitted for simple distillation, and ethyl bromide and other volatile materials are distilled from the reaction mixture over a period of 3–4 hr by continued heating at 115°C (oil bath). The resulting light-yellow oil is cooled to room temperature, whereupon it solidifies. The crude product is collected by suction filtration and washed with three 100-mL portions of cold petroleum ether (bp 60–68°C) to give 50.1–56.3 g (80–90%) of diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate as white crystals, mp 60–63°C, which are used in the next step without further purification.

Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated. Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.

The solution is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath (temperature −78 °C), and diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexanes (86.4 mL, 86.4 mmol) is added slowly via syringe through one of the septa over 20 min. After 30 min at −78 °C, the reaction is quenched by careful addition of methanol (10 mL) via a glass pipette over approximately 10 min. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and poured into a mixture of saturated NH4Cl (250 mL) and 1N HCl (250 mL) with stirring, and the stirring is continued for 30 min. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ether (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are sequentially washed with water (2 × 200 mL) and brine (2 × 200 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporator and vacuum drying. The concentrated residue is loaded onto a column (5.0 × 21 cm) of 200 g of silica gel and eluted with 300 mL of hexanes. At that point, collection of 50-mL fractions in glass tubes (25 × 150 mm) is begun, while elution is continued with 500 mL of 5% EtOAc-hexanes, 500 mL of 10% EtOAc-hexanes, 500 mL of 15% EtOAc-hexanes, and then 500 mL of 20 % EtOAc-hexanes. The fractions are analyzed by TLC on silica gel with 30% EtOAc-hexanes as eluent and visualized with p-anisaldehyde staining reagent. The product is obtained in fractions 24–42, which are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield geranylgeraniol (7.20 g, overall 70% from β-keto ester 3).

To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum, is added a mixture of 2.5 g (21 mmol) of allylbenzene, 2 mL (20 mmol) of ethyl acetate, and 20 mL of a 1M solution of chlorotitanium triisopropoxide in hexane, and 160 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). After the mixture has been cooled to 0°C with an ice bath under a nitrogen atmosphere, a 1M solution of cyclopentylmagnesium chloride in ether (80 mL, 80 mmol;) is added over a period of 2.5 hr via a syringe pump. After the addition is complete, the resulting black reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min at 0°C, then is quenched by the cautious addition of water (15 mL). The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite, which is rinsed thoroughly with ether (4 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate and rinsings are poured into a separatory funnel containing 50 mL of water and shaken thoroughly. The organic phase is separated, washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Purification of the crude product (obtained as a pale yellow oil) by column chromatography on 80 g of silica gel using 1:20 ethyl acetate:hexane as the eluent provides 2.6 g (80%) of trans-2-benzyl-1-methylcyclopropan-1-ol (2) as a colorless oil.

(0.80 mole) of freshly-distilled ethyl bromide in 100 ml. of pure pentane is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-minute period while the solution warms to room temperature. Formation of a precipitate begins after an hour and is virtually complete after 6 hours. After the mixture has been stirred for 2 days, 400 ml. of 4 N hydrochloric acid is carefully added with cooling (ice bath) and stirring. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with 15 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered.

In the flask are placed 48 g. (2 moles) of magnesium turnings, 150 cc. of anhydrous ether and 100 g. of bromomesitylene (p. 95). The reaction starts slowly, and sometimes it is necessary to add some iodine or use Gilman's catalyst. After the reaction starts, it proceeds smoothly and the remaining 298 g. of bromomesitylene (a total of 2 moles) in about 700 cc. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the ether boils briskly. After the last of this ether solution has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam cone until practically all the magnesium has dissolved.

In each of three 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flasks is placed 210 ml. (210 g., 1.61 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate. The flasks are placed in an ice-salt bath and chilled to 0°; to each flask there is then added 45 ml. (35.2 g., 0.78 mole) of acetaldehyde. When the contents of the flasks have cooled to −5° to 0° there is added to each flask, with shaking, a solution of 2 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol. The flasks, the contents of which become cloudy in a short time because of the separation of water, are kept in the ice-salt bath for 6 hours. The reaction mixtures are then combined in a 1-l. flask and placed in an icebox. About 24 hours later, 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with shaking, and the flask is replaced in an icebox until the next day. The addition of 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is repeated once more, and the mixture is again returned to the icebox for 24 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature. At some point during this reaction period the mixture should crystallize as a mass of yellow-white needles. This product is crude ethyl ethylidenebisacetoacetate.

An exothermic reaction should set in; the ice bath is removed, if necessary, to get the reaction to start. When the temperature begins to fall, the remainder of the methyl sulfate is admitted at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 12–15°; this takes at least twenty minutes. When the addition is complete the mixture is stirred an additional forty minutes; during this time the temperature will drop to about 5°. The stirrer is stopped, and the oily, upper layer is separated at once. The lower, aqueous layer is returned to the flask and methylated as before with a second 200-cc. portion of methyl sulfate.

After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour. The petroleum ether layer is separated and discarded. The dark semisolid residue is made acidic by addition of 6 M hydrochloric acid, and the acidic mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours. The resulting solution is extracted with diethyl ether in a continuous extractor until all of the diethylsulfamide has dissolved. The ether is evaporated using a rotary evaporator, yielding 58–61 g.. (44–45%) of crude N,N'-diethylsulfamide, m.p. 65–67°, which is of sufficient purity for use in the next step.

Phenylsulfenyl chloride. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a pressure-equalizing 125-mL dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with thiophenol (21 mL), dry triethylamine (0.25 mL), and dry pentane (100 mL) under a blanket of nitrogen. The remaining neck of the flask is stoppered and the nitrogen is allowed to sweep gently through the flask and out of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask and its contents are cooled to 0°C with an ice bath and stirring is begun. The dropping funnel is charged with sulfuryl chloride (19 mL). The sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise over a 1-hr period to the chilled thiophenol solution with stirring. During this addition, a thick layer of white solid forms. It gradually dissolves as it is broken down. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to stir for 1 hr longer while slowly warming to room temperature. During the course of the addition and subsequent stirring, the clear, pale-yellow solution becomes dark orange-red. The dropping funnel is replaced with an outlet adapter connected to a vacuum pump and the nitrogen inlet is exchanged for a ground glass stopper. The pentane and excess sulfuryl chloride are removed under reduced pressure at room temperature.

INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium hydroxide. & type: mixture & concentration: 50% & note: aqueous & speed: slow &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: an ice bath. & [ settemp ] temperature: an ice bath. & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: Solid sodium hydroxide & type: pure & mass: 24 g. &  )  & DESCRIPTION: Part of the excess hydrogen chloride is removed by blowing (or drawing) air through the solution for 1 hour. The solution then is made alkaline by the slow addition of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide. with mechanical stirring and cooling in an ice bath. Solid sodium hydroxide (24 g.) is added, and the mixture is steam-distilled until no more ammonia and acetophenone pass into the distillate. About 3–4 l. of distillate is collected.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: Isocaproyl chloride & type: pure & mass: 84.7 g. &  )  & [ settemp ] time: over a period of 20 minutes. & [ settemp ] N/A: stirring & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: acetylene & type: pure & speed: continued for 30 minutes after the rapid absorption which lasts 1–2 hours &  )  & DESCRIPTION: The gas inlet tube is replaced by a dropping funnel protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Isocaproyl chloride (84.7 g., 0.63 mole) is added to the reaction mixture with stirring over a period of 20 minutes. The dropping funnel is replaced by the gas inlet tube (inlet tube wiped with a dry towel), and, with stirring, acetylene is bubbled just below the surface of the mixture at a rate noticeably above the saturation rate. After 15 minutes to 1 hour the rate of absorption of acetylene suddenly becomes very rapid, and the acetylene is passed through as rapidly as it is absorbed. The introduction of acetylene is continued for 30 minutes after the rapid absorption (which lasts 1–2 hours) has subsided.
INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] time: thirty to forty minutes. & [ settemp ] N/A: cool & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sulfuric acid. & type: pure & volume: 800 cc. & concentration: concentrated & speed: slowly &  )  & DESCRIPTION: In order to evaporate the solution, the flask is then placed in an oil bath, which is brought to a temperature of 150–155°. As soon as solid material begins to separate, the mixture will bump badly unless a rather rapid current of air is passed through the reaction mixture. This has the further advantage of hastening the evaporation. The heating is continued until a thick, pasty, gray mass is left as a residue, the process requiring thirty to forty minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool and then made strongly acid by the addition of 800 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. This must be done slowly and under a hood on account of the rapid evolution of hydrogen bromide.

In an oven dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum are placed 3,6-dibromocarbazole (10.0 g, 31.0 mmol) and sodium hydroxide pellets (1.2 g, 30.0 mmol) in 500 mL of dry acetone under an argon atmosphere. Diethyl sulfate (4.1 mL, 31.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred reaction mixture at room temperature. After the addition, the reaction is stirred for 8 hr at which time all solids are removed by filtration and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL) and successively washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 × 75 mL), brine (3 × 75 mL) and water (3 × 75 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate , filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid. Recrystallization from 95% ethanol (ca. 350 mL) gives 3,6-dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole (8.85 g, 81% yield) as white needles, mp 139-141°C (lit.2 mp 137-138°C). The filtrate is evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized to give additional product (0.24 g, 2% yield).

To the resulting solution is added with a plastic syringe and hypodermic needle 1.35 mL (4.6 mmol) of tetraisopropyl titanate. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 2 hr. To remove the methanol formed, the flask is transferred to a rotary evaporator, and the contents are concentrated to 10–12 mL. The oily residue is once more dissolved in 250 mL of absolute 2-propanol and refluxed for 2 hr. The solvent is removed again in a rotary evaporator, and the resulting yellow oil is dissolved in 100 mL of diethyl ether. After addition of 5 mL of water the pale mixture is vigorously stirred for 10 min and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The flaky suspension is filtered and the filter cake washed with three 25-mL portions of ether. The ether solution is concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The residue, 12.5–13.1 g of a slightly yellow oil, solidifies on standing. This solid is freed from small amounts of solvent by an oil-pump vacuum (ca. 0.01 mm) at room temperature for 2 hr. Further purification by short-path distillation at 91–93°C/0.05 mm furnishes 11.5–12.0 g (91–95%) of a slightly yellow solid, which turns colorless on crushing, mp 41.5–42.5°C, [α]DRT +42 ± 0.3° (CHCl3, c 4).

In order to saponify the small amount of ester which is produced, a solution of 20 g. of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water is then added and boiling continued for two additional hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled and acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid; the precipitated trimethylgallic acid is filtered with suction and washed well with cold water. The product, which melts at 157–160°, is sufficiently pure for many purposes. It weighs 50–52 g. (89–92 per cent of the theoretical amount). It may be purified by recrystallization from 2 l. of boiling water with the use of decolorizing carbon, the filtration being carried out in a steam-jacketed funnel.

After the solution has cooled to room temperature, 20 ml. of acetic anhydride is added; a white crystalline precipitate starts to form immediately. After the mixture has stood for 18–24 hours, it is treated with 20 ml. of water and boiled until the precipitate has dissolved. The clear solution is diluted with 70 ml. of water and allowed to cool. The crystalline product is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 105°/20 mm. The yield of 3β-acetoxyetienic acid, m.p. 235–238°, is 23–24 g. Recrystallization from glacial acetic acid gives a purer product, m.p. 238–240°. The yield is 16–18 g. (55–63% based on the amount of pregnenolone acetate used).

Finally, 165–200 g. of pure furfural (b.p. 90°/65 mm.; 159°/745 mm.) distils, and this fraction, collected separately, is found to be practically colorless. The distillation of the crude material must not be carried out under ordinary pressure; otherwise the product turns dark rapidly on standing. After one distillation under reduced pressure as described, however, a distillation under atmospheric pressure may be carried out without the objectionable results just mentioned.

Analysis by GC indicates a chemical purity of 96–98%. An enantiomeric purity of 96.4–97.5% is determined by 1H NMR analysis of the derived acetate using Eu(hfc)3, tris[3-(heptafluoropropylhydroxymethylene)-d-camphorato] europium(III), as the chiral shift reagent. The enantiomeric purity may also be determined by GC analysis of the derived α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid esters3 and. An alternative to the distillation method is purification by preparative HPLC and and bulb-to-bulb distillation to give 21.85 g (78%) of (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a white solid, mp 19°C, [α]D25 −46.6° (CHCl3, c 1.0).

(0.7 mole) of sodium azide in 150 ml. of water. A mixture of 109 g. (0.5 mole) of lauroyl chloride (b.p. 134–137°/11 mm.) and 150 ml. of acetone is then added from a separatory funnel to the well-stirred solution of the azide at such a rate that the temperature remains at 10–15°. After the mixture has been stirred at this temperature for an hour, the stirrer is stopped and, when the layers have separated, the lower water layer is removed carefully by suction through a glass capillary tube. The upper layer is then added slowly to 500 ml. of benzene which has been warmed to 60°. A rather rapid evolution of gas results, and the mixture is kept at 60–70° until no more nitrogen is evolved; the conversion of azide to isocyanate requires about an hour. The solution is filtered to remove any insoluble matter, and the benzene is removed by distillation from a modified Claisen flask. Distillation of the residue yields 80–85 g. of ester (81–86%) and.

If the procedure is carried out properly, 700–800 g. of Ba(OH)2·8H2O should suffice. The time required by this method is greater than when a hot solution of barium hydroxide is used, but the method is more convenient and does not cause such a great increase in volume. After removal of the barium arsenate by filtration, the mother liquor and washings are treated with sulfuric acid until the solution contains neither barium nor sulfate ions. When the barium sulfate has been separated and thoroughly washed, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to about 3 l., neutralized to litmus with sodium hydroxide, filtered, evaporated until the solution becomes well coated with crystals, and then treated with 2.5 volumes of alcohol. After the mixture has cooled in an ice box, the sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is separated, washed with alcohol, and dried in an oven at 80°. A second crop may be secured from the filtrate by concentrating it further and precipitating with alcohol. The total yield of anhydrous sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is 252 g. (33 per cent of the theoretical amount). By proper manipulation, it is possible to obtain as much as 240 g. in the first crop and to have it free from sulfate, arsenate, and sodium o-hydroxyphenylarsonate which is one of the by-products formed in this reaction.

To remove 1,2-dichlorobenzene the bath temperature is raised to 80 °C until solid just begins to appear on the inside wall of the flask. Nitrogen is added while the vacuum is broken, and the flask is removed from the rotary evaporator. Degassed methanol is added gently against the inside wall of the flask. As methanol mixes with the product, the solution becomes cloudy and a precipitate forms. The addition is continued until precipitation is complete. The total amount of methanol required is approximately 400 mL. The precipitate is collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel and washed with methanol (5 × 10 mL) and hexane (3 × 10 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 12 h at room temperature to obtain red microcrystals of the title compound (2.08 g, 2.61 mmol) in 94% overall yield and 91% purity (determined by HPLC analysis). The product can be used as is for further transformations, or it can be purified by preparative HPLC.

(1 mole) of liquefied ethyl ethoxymethylenecyanoacetate is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture over a period of 2 hours. This rate of addition keeps the reaction mixture warm. The solution is then stirred and gently refluxed for 6 hours. The sodium salt of the carbethoxypyrimidine may precipitate during the course of the reaction.

(0.100 mole) of 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride, and 200 ml. of dichloromethane, and the addition funnel contains 14.0 g. (0.105 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. Stirring is begun, and the flask is immersed in an ice bath. When the solution has been chilled thoroughly, the aluminum chloride is added in small portions at such a rate that the reaction mixture remains below 5°.

(1 mole) of chromic anhydride dissolved in 100 cc. of water, and 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added. The α-chlorohydrindene is then admitted through the funnel at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 35–40°, the flask being cooled externally. This addition takes about one and one-half hours; after it is complete, stirring is continued for fifteen minutes before the mixture is poured into a large beaker and diluted with 300 cc. of water. After the acid present is neutralized by the addition of solid sodium carbonate, the α-hydrindone is expelled from the mixture by steam distillation, care being taken to avoid entrainment of froth at the beginning of the process. When about 2.5 l. of distillate has been collected, the solution again begins to froth. The operation is stopped at this point, since further distillation does not yield an appreciable quantity of product. The α-hydrindone usually solidifies, as soon as the distillate is chilled, to a mixture of colorless crystals and a yellow solid; the product is collected after thorough cooling in an ice bath. This moist solid is dissolved in 200 cc. of benzene, and the solution is subjected to distillation until free from water. After the benzene is removed by vacuum distillation on the steam bath, the α-hydrindone is distilled. It boils at 125–126°/17 mm., and the distillate is a pale yellow solid, m.p. 39–41°. The yield is 46–55 g. (50–60 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the indene used) and.

The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes before 300 ml. of cold water is added to dissolve all of the precipitated salts. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with one 50-ml. portion of pentane. The extract is combined with the original pentane solution and dried over approximately 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the product is distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, giving 69–72 g. (38–39%) of 7,7-dichlorobicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene, b.p. 50–51° (0.8 mm.).

(1.5 moles) of iodine and 400 g. (455 cc., 5.1 moles) of benzene. The mixture is heated to about 50° on a water bath, and 275 cc. (6.15 moles) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50) is added slowly from the separatory funnel; the time required for the addition should be about one and one-quarter hours. A copious evolution of oxides of nitrogen takes place, and the gases are carried off from the upper end of the condenser to an open window or hood, or absorbed by means of a gas trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97). The reaction proceeds smoothly, and the temperature rises slowly without the application of heat until the mixture boils gently. When all the nitric acid has been added, the solution is refluxed for about fifteen minutes. If iodine still remains, more nitric acid should be added slowly to the warm solution until the purple color of the iodine has been discharged and the solution becomes brownish red.

A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with imidate 1 and 300 ml. of xylene. The solution is refluxed for 8 hours. After cooling to room temperature the dark xylene solution is filtered through a short column (4.5 cm. in diameter) packed with silica gel (70 g.) and toluene. The column is eluted with an additional 250 ml. of toluene, and the combined light yellow eluant is concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Vacuum distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column yields 20–22 g. (67–74% for the two steps) of octadiene 2 as a colorless liquid, b.p. 94–97° (0.03 mm.).

A stream of chlorine is passed through the dioxane/iodine solution heated at 90°C, and the reaction is monitored by NMR spectroscopy. After 9 hr, the conversion is 50% complete; after 33 hr, about 90% complete. At this point, the stream of chlorine is interrupted. Reinitiation of the chlorine stream after some hours (next morning, for example) may be dangerous because it was observed in one case the mixture inflamed spontaneously! The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, 500 mL of ether is added, and the solution is washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution. The organic layer is separated, dried over sodium sulfate, the ether is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column, to yield 1200–1300 g of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane, bp 89°C/16 mm (lit.1 bp 82.5°C/14 mm; mp 31°C).

(0.74 mole) of N-grade wood rosin, 740 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 42 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). A stream of carbon dioxide is passed over the surface of the solution by means of a glass tube which extends downward through the condenser during this reaction. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 hours. At the end of this time, the ethanol and acid are removed by steam distillation and the water is decanted. The residue is cooled to room temperature and dissolved in 1 l. of ether. The ether solution is extracted with water and dried over 200 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate.

Diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3). An oven-dried, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and a rubber septum through which is inserted a large bore, needle-tipped nitrogen line vented through an oil bubbler, is charged with 29.7 g (0.110 mol) of diethyl (2S,3S)-2-bromo-3-hydroxy succinate and 80 mL of dry ethanol. In a separate, oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, capped with a rubber septum and vented though a bubbler as described above, a solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol is prepared from 3.05 g of sodium (0.132 mol) and 120 mL of dry ethanol. (Caution: This operation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood. Sodium is a highly reactive metal, avoid exposure to moisture. Hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable and forms explosive mixtures with air, is rapidly evolved. External cooling may be necessary.) The two flasks are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and connected by means of a long double needle-tipped cannula. Magnetic stirring is initiated, and the ethanolic solution of the succinate 2 is cooled in an ice-water bath for 15 min followed by dropwise addition of the solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol which is transferred via the cannula under a very slight positive pressure of nitrogen. Complete transfer of the base should require 2 hr. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0–10°C (bath temperature) and then quenched by the addition of 1.43 mL (0.025 mol) of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is diluted with 900 mL of water, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and extracted four times with 100 mL of dichloromethane.

Eighty-eight grams (78 ml., 0.46 mole of peracid) of 40% peracetic acid is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask which is immersed in a water bath maintained at 25–30°. A 150-ml. dropping funnel is mounted so that the stem enters the flask to within about 4 cm. of the liquid surface. With mechanical stirring, a cold solution of 20 g. (0.14 mole) of β-naphthol in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise over a period of 4 hours to the peracid. With the appropriate rate of addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture slowly rises to 30–35° and should not exceed 40°. Solid material begins to separate from the orange solution when one-third or more of the naphthol solution is introduced. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour and the flask is allowed to stand in the water bath until the exothermic reaction ceases (usually 6–8 hours), then at room temperature for 4 days. The solid material is collected by suction filtration and washed on the filter with sufficient (10–20 ml.) acetic acid to remove colored impurities. Drying in the air gives 19.6–20.1 g. of crude o-carboxycinnamic acid as a pale yellow crystalline solid and.

Sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) is cut in strips (about ½ by ½ by 3 in.) so that they can be inserted through the side neck of the flask. One of these pieces of sodium is attached to the fish-hook and is gradually lowered into the liquid ammonia while a rapid stream of acetylene is passed in. The sodium should be added at such a rate that the entire solution does not turn blue. If it does, the sodium should be raised above the level of the ammonia until the color is discharged. The rest of the sodium is added in a similar manner; the addition requires about 45 minutes, depending on the rate of passage of the acetylene.

The bulk of the THF is removed from the resulting colorless solution by concentration under reduced pressure. An additional 250 mL of water is added to the aqueous concentrate, and the resulting aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted sequentially with one 500-mL and four 250-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The clear, colorless, oily residue is dissolved in 300 mL of warm (50°C) THF, 10 mL of water is added, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to 23°C, whereupon the product crystallizes as its monohydrate within 1 hr. The crystallization process is completed by cooling the crystallization flask to −20°C. After standing for 2 hr at −20°C, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 200 mL of ether . The crystals are dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to provide 62.8 g (72%) of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide monohydrate.

(0.0080 mole) of sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate in the least possible amount of water is combined with a solution of 0.55 g. (0.0080 mole) of sodium nitrite in the least amount of water. A mixture of 16 ml. of 2N sulfuric acid and 22 ml. of glycerol is placed in a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a low-temperature thermometer, and a stirrer, and the flask is immersed in a bath of acetone and dry ice. The stirred mixture is cooled to −15°, and the solution of sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate and sodium nitrite is added dropwise over a period of about 5 minutes; the cooling and rate of addition are such as to maintain the temperature at −15° ± 3°. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours at this temperature, and 30 ml. of ether is added. The product is stirred vigorously for a few minutes and then allowed to warm to −6° with gentle stirring. The ether layer is decanted or transferred by means of a chilled pipet into a vessel cooled in a dry ice bath, and the reaction mixture is again cooled to −15°. In this way the reaction mixture is extracted with five 20-ml. portions of ether. After the last extraction the aqueous layer is frozen solid and the ether layer is poured off. The combined extracts are dried at −20°, first over calcium chloride and then over phosphorus pentoxide; a cold room at −20° is particularly convenient for this operation. The solution is transferred to a tared distillation flask immersed in an ice bath, and the ether is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The flask is weighed rapidly and dried in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide at −20° ( Caution!(Note 12)). The residue is 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole 1,1-dioxide in the form of yellow-brown needles; weight 0.77–1.04 g. (57–77%). It explodes between 45° and 60°.

(3.2 moles) of n-butyl sulfite (p. 112). The condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap, and 217 g. (131 cc., 1.6 moles) of sulfuryl chloride is added over a period of thirty minutes, with rapid stirring and cooling with tap water. The dropping funnel is then replaced by a thermometer dipping into the liquid, and the flask is heated slowly, with stirring, until the refluxing of the butyl chloride becomes vigorous (about 100–110°). Sulfur dioxide is evolved copiously during this time. The condenser is replaced with a 40-cm. Vigreux column and downward condenser; the temperature is gradually raised to 130–135° and kept there until no more sulfur dioxide or butyl chloride distils. The heating and distillation require about two hours. The residue of crude n-butyl sulfate is cooled to room temperature, and 100 cc. of saturated sodium carbonate solution is added. The mixture is stirred for about ten minutes, poured into a separatory funnel, and let stand for thirty minutes to allow the layers to separate. The upper layer is dried with calcium chloride, at least overnight, and then allowed to stand over 15 g. of anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate for a day, with occasional shaking. The product is filtered into a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and distilled from an oil bath. The first distillation gives 250–280 g. (74–83 per cent of the calculated amount) of n-butyl sulfate, b.p. 110–114°/4 mm., which has a sharp odor. Redistillation gives a pure material with a slight ester odor, boiling at 109–111° at 4 mm., with only a small mechanical loss.

The contents of the flask are cooled to 20° by means of an ice bath, the addition funnel is temporarily replaced by a stopper, and to the stirred acetic acid is added 110 g. (2 moles) of 95% sodium cyanide in small portions. The temperature of the mixture is maintained around 20°, and the addition requires about 20 minutes. The addition funnel is replaced, and a previously prepared and cooled solution of 500 g. (272 ml., 4.9 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added slowly, with stirring, the temperature of the mixture being kept at about 20° by means of an ice bath. The ice bath is removed, and 300 g. (2 moles) of α,α-dimethyl-β-phenethyl alcohol is added over a 20-minute period during which the temperature of the mixture rises slowly to 35–45°. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 90 minutes and allowed to stand overnight. The amber-colored mixture containing some solid sodium sulfate is aerated with nitrogen for 2 hours (Caution! In a hood), poured into 3 l. of ice water, and the supernatant oil separated. The aqueous phase is neutralized with sodium carbonate and extracted with 600 ml. of ether. The ethereal extract is combined with the original oily supernatant, neutralized with sodium carbonate, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled to yield 230–248 g. (65–70%) of product, b.p. 137–141° (2 mm.). Redistillation of the ether-containing fore-run yields up to an additional 14 g. of material.

A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. The flask is charged with 420 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and the solvent is cooled to −62°C in an acetone–dry ice bath. Tungsten hexachloride (60g, 0.15 mol) is then introduced. While the cold suspension is stirred, 31 mL (0.30 mol) of 90% butyllithium in hexane is added slowly from a hypodermic syringe. The rate of addition (complete in ca. 5 min) is such that the temperature remains below −15°C. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. The green-brown viscous suspension becomes a dark-brown homogeneous solution that eventually turns green at room temperature. Because the reaction with the epoxide is exothermic, the flask is momentarily returned to the acetone–dry ice bath while 14.8 g (0.081 mol) of trans-cyclododecene oxide and is introduced with a hypodermic syringe. The cooling bath is again removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature. After 30 min the mixture is poured into 600 mL of an aqueous solution that is 1.5 M in sodium tartrate and 2 M in sodium hydroxide, and extracted with 240 mL of hexane.

The acetylene from a tank is sufficiently purified by passage through a sulfuric acid wash bottle; a safety trap also should be inserted in the line. Sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) is cut in strips (about ½ by ½ by 3 in.) so that they can be inserted through the side neck of the flask. One of these pieces of sodium is attached to the fish-hook and is gradually lowered into the liquid ammonia while a rapid stream of acetylene is passed in. The sodium should be added at such a rate that the entire solution does not turn blue. If it does, the sodium should be raised above the level of the ammonia until the color is discharged. The rest of the sodium is added in a similar manner; the addition requires about 45 minutes, depending on the rate of passage of the acetylene.

The flask is immersed in a preheated oil bath and the resulting solution is refluxed such that approximately 25 mL of the solvent is distilled off at atmospheric pressure. The solution is allowed to reach ambient temperature and the distillation head is replaced by a glass stopper. Bismuth tribromide (1.32 g, 2.94 mmol) is added in one portion and stirring is continued for 10 min. The glass stopper is then replaced by a rubber septum. Triethylsilane (8.2 mL, 51.34 mmol) is added via syringe over 5 min causing the immediate formation of a black suspension. The mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath to 0–5 °C before trimethylacetaldehyde (5.1 mL, 46.96 mmol) is added via syringe at such a rate as to maintain the internal temperature below 15 °C. The ice-water bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 30 min and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min.. The mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the black precipitate. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C/10 mmHg) to give a mixture of clear and orange oils.

The reaction flask is charged with 18.8 g (0.34 mol) of anhydrous powdered sodium methoxide in 60 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and 47.5 mL (0.35 mol) of diethyl oxalate is added over 5 min from the addition funnel. The ice bath is removed and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 min. At the end of this time a pale yellow, thick suspension results, to which 50 g (0.3 mol) of anhydrous powdered 3-methyl-4-nitroanisole, 1, is added, followed by 75 mL of anhydrous ether.

Dimethylsulfoxonium (S)-2-oxo-3-(Boc-amino)-4-phenylbutylide (2). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar, a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen outlet, and a rubber septum through which is inserted a temperature probe. The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min and is then charged with trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (33.0 g, 150 mmol), which is added through a neck that is temporarily opened, and 150 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, which is added by syringe through a septum. A 1.0 M solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL, 150 mmol) is added via syringe through a septum, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h. The resulting solution of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (containing precipitated potassium iodide) is cooled to 0 °C. The reflux condenser is replaced with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of Boc-L-phenylalanine 4-nitrophenyl ester (1) (19.3 g, 50.0 mmol) in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and capped with a nitrogen outlet. The solution is added dropwise over 20 min so that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The flask is briefly opened by temporary removal of the addition funnel to allow addition of 50 mL of water and stirring is continued for 15 min at 0 °C. After warming to room temperature, the mixture is filtered through a short pad (3 mm) of Celite on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The concentrated mixture is rinsed into a 1-L separatory funnel with 200 mL of water and extracted with one 200-mL portion and two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are washed with one 50-mL portion of water and two 50-mL portions of brine.

(2.7 moles) of nitrosodimethylamine, 3 l. of water, and 650 g. (10 gram atoms) of 100 per cent zinc dust, or an equivalent amount of lower-quality material. While the mixture is stirred and maintained at 25–30° by immersion in a water bath, 1 l. (14 moles) of 85 per cent acetic acid is added from the dropping funnel over a period of two hours. Subsequently the reaction mixture is heated for one hour at 60°, allowed to cool, and the excess zinc dust filtered and washed with a little water. The aqueous liquors are combined and transferred to a 12-l. flask arranged for steam distillation. The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, and the steam inlet is provided with a trap. A large filtering or distilling flask serves as the receiver, and the side tube is connected with two absorption flasks, each containing 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid. The aqueous liquors are made distinctly alkaline by adding a concentrated solution of 1 kg. of sodium hydroxide through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is then steam-distilled until a test portion of the distillate shows only a faint reduction with Fehling's solution. Usually about 5–6 l. of distillate suffices to remove the dimethylhydrazine. The distillation is more rapid if a free flame is placed under the distillation flask.

The remaining ether solution is stirred using an overhead stirrer with 4 L of aqueous 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 60 g of crude sodium taurocholate. An opaque emulsion forms. The reaction is started by adding 2000 units of cholesterol esterase activity (100–150 g of bovine pancreas acetone powder,). Stirring is continued at ~25°C and the flask is stoppered to minimize evaporation of ether. The pH of the emulsion is measured occasionally and readjusted to 7.2 ± 0.3 by adding aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide. Approximately 250 mL of base is consumed during the first 3 hr; an additional 400 mL is consumed over the next 20 hr. Although the consumption of base virtually ceases after 24 hr, stirring is continued for a total of 3 days.

The solution is filtered into a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a gas-tight, mechanically driven Hershberg stirrer. Through one of the side necks extends an inlet tube which ends in a coarse sintered-glass gas-dispersing tip extending well into the liquid into the liquid in the flask. The inlet tube is connected with a cylinder of phosgene through an empty safety flask. In the third neck of the flask is mounted an addition tube, through the vertical arm of which a thermometer is mounted so that the bulb is immersed in the reaction liquid. The outlet is attached to the lateral arm of the addition tube and is connected to an empty safety flask which in turn is connected to a Drechsel bottle charged with ammonium hydroxide.
INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] temperature: a slush of ice and water & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ice & type: pure & mass: 200 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. & concentration: concentrated &  )  & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ settemp ] N/A: heated & DESCRIPTION: The flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam.

The reflux condenser is now removed and one set for downward distillation is attached to the side arm. The mixture is distilled and about two-thirds of the liquid removed in this way. The residue is cooled, the liquid poured off from solid material and distilled up to 210°.

The removal of salicylic acid is practically complete when about 10–12 l. of distillate has come over, although the distillate still gives a ferric chloride test for salicylic acid. The solution in the flask is allowed to cool overnight and is finally chilled in an ice bath.
INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] temperature: a slush of ice and water & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ice & type: pure & mass: 200 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. & concentration: concentrated &  )  & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ settemp ] N/A: heated & DESCRIPTION: The flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam.
INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] time: one hour & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: benzanilide & type: pure &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ settemp ] N/A: stirring & [ filter ] N/A: filtering & [ settemp ] time: two hours & [ filter ] N/A: filtered. & [ settemp ] time: one hour & [ filter ] N/A: filtered. & [ settemp ] N/A: stirring & [ filter ] N/A: filtering & [ settemp ] time: two hours & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ dry ] N/A: air-dried & DESCRIPTION: The purplish-gray solid is ground in a large mortar and is poured with vigorous stirring into a 12-l. (3-gallon) crock containing 6 l. of approximately normal hydrochloric acid (5.5 l. of water and 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid). The stirring is continued for one hour after all the benzanilide has been added, and then the solid is filtered on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel. The process of stirring with acid and filtering is repeated twice to remove the excess of aniline. The solid is stirred for two hours with 6 l. of water and is filtered. It is stirred for one hour with 6 l. of normal sodium hydroxide solution to remove the excess of benzoic acid and is then filtered. The stirring with alkali and filtering is repeated. The solid is next stirred for two hours with 7 l. of water and is filtered, sucked dry, and air-dried overnight on paper.

After seven days at 35° the semi-crystalline mass is stirred into 0 l. of cold water. With good stirring the flocculent precipitate of α-cellobiose octaacetate and cellulose-dextrin acetates soon becomes crystalline; after standing for one to two hours the solid is collected on a 12.5-cm. Büchner funnel, washed free from acid with cold water, and drained thoroughly. The moist product, weighing about 250 g., is triturated with 250 cc. of warm methyl alcohol, and, after cooling to room temperature, the undissolved solid is collected on a 7-cm. Büchner funnel, washed with three 50-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The yield of fairly pure α-cellobiose octaacetate is 69–74 g. For purification it is dissolved in 300 cc. of chloroform and the solution is filtered by suction into a dry receiver through a pad prepared by dusting Norite onto a Büchner funnel and washing the funnel with alcohol. The chloroform solution is filtered while the pad is still wet with alcohol, and the filter is washed at once with 100 cc. of chloroform without interruption in the filtration. The colorless filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure until the acetate begins to crystallize (about 250 cc.), the crystals are redissolved by warming, and the solution is poured into 750 cc. of warm methyl alcohol. The acetate begins to crystallize at once as small needles which eventually form a thick paste. The mixture is cooled to 0° with stirring, and after about one hour the material is collected, washed with 100 cc. of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The yield of colorless α-cellobiose octaacetate, m.p. 220–222°, [α]20°D + 41.6°, is 65–69 g. (35–37 per cent of the theoretical amount, assuming that the cotton contains 10 per cent of moisture),, and.

The resulting crystalline cake is crushed with 50 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, filtered, and the process repeated. The white, crystalline product is almost pure methylhydrazine sulfate and contains very little hydrazine sulfate. After drying in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride, the yield is 105–110 g. (76–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). For purification, the sulfate is dissolved in about 250 cc. of boiling 80 per cent ethyl alcohol, and any undissolved material (chiefly hydrazine sulfate) is filtered. On cooling, the methylhydrazine sulfate separates in white plates, which are filtered with suction and washed with a little absolute alcohol. After drying over calcium chloride, the first fraction, m.p. 141–142°, weighs 70–75 g. (51–54 per cent of the theoretical amount).

(1R,2S,5R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)cyclohexanol (3). In a 500-mL round-bottomed reaction flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, 12.8 g (41 mmol) of 5 (48%) is dissolved in a solution of 300 mL of ethanol, 40 mL of water, and 46 g (82 mmol) of potassium hydroxide. This solution is refluxed for 2 hr. The solution is concentrated at reduced pressure to a volume of ca. 50 mL and 200 mL of water and 100 mL of ether are added. After the ether layer is separated, the aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is evaporated.

The mixture is cooled, diluted with 350 mL of pentane, and washed four times with 200-mL portions of cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. The aqueous phases are extracted twice with 100-mL portions of pentane and the combined organic phases are washed rapidly with 100 mL of ice–cold aqueous 2 N HCl and immediately thereafter with a cold saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. After the mixture has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the pentane is removed by rotary evaporation. Distillation of the oily residue at 60°C (12 mm) using a 20-cm Vigreux column affords 50.1–51.6 g (60–62%) of 1-trimethylsiloxycyclopentene (1) as a colorless liquid.

Spattering is minimized by allowing the solution to run down the wall of the container. The yellow precipitate is filtered after boiling for five minutes, and the filtrate is saved. The moist solid is boiled for five minutes with a solution of 30 g. (0.28 mole) of sodium carbonate in 400 cc. of water, collected with suction, and washed well with water. After drying in the air the crude acridone weighs 35.5–37.5 g. (91–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 344–346°. This material is pure enough for many purposes; it may be recrystallized from a mixture of aniline and acetic acid, using 10 cc. of aniline and 25 cc. of acetic acid for every 2 g. of solid. The recovery is about 90 per cent, and the recrystallized product melts at 348–352°.

The crude p-ethoxyphenylurea is obtained in a yield of 740–810 g. (82–90%) as a nearly white to pale yellow solid. This material may be purified by recrystallization from boiling water, when minute white plates, m.p. 173–174°, are obtained.

The bottle is charged with 37.5 g. (0.475 mole) of pyridine and cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath. After the pyridine has solidified, 87.5 g. (4.37 moles) of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is condensed from a cylinder into the bottle through the inlet tube. The amount of hydrogen fluoride is determined by weighing the bottle. After the hydrogen fluoride has cooled, the bottle is cautiously swirled with cooling until the solid dissolves. The solution can now be safely allowed to warm to room temperature.

At the end of this time the boiling water bath is replaced by an ice bath. When the reaction mixture has been cooled to room temperature it is made alkaline by the careful addition of a solution of 280 g. (7 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water. This must be done slowly and with good cooling to prevent boiling. A solid salt, which at first separates, largely dissolves at a later stage.

Diazabicyclooctane-hydrogen peroxide (DABCO · 2H2O2) complex. A 1-L, two-necked flask, fitted with a dropping funnel, 3-cm stirring bar, and a thermometer, is charged with diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) (28.05 g, 0.25 mol) dissolved in commercial grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) (375 mL). The flask is cooled to 0°C (internal temperature, ice-salt bath), and hydrogen peroxide (49 mL of a 35% solution, 0.5 mol) is slowly added at such a rate that the temperature remains constant, under vigorous stirring. A precipitate appears immediately and, after completing the addition of hydrogen peroxide, stirring is continued at 0°C for 1 hr.

The reflux condenser is replaced with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of Boc-L-phenylalanine 4-nitrophenyl ester (1) (19.3 g, 50.0 mmol) in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and capped with a nitrogen outlet. The solution is added dropwise over 20 min so that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The flask is briefly opened by temporary removal of the addition funnel to allow addition of 50 mL of water and stirring is continued for 15 min at 0 °C. After warming to room temperature, the mixture is filtered through a short pad (3 mm) of Celite on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The concentrated mixture is rinsed into a 1-L separatory funnel with 200 mL of water and extracted with one 200-mL portion and two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are washed with one 50-mL portion of water and two 50-mL portions of brine. (In some cases solid product separates during the first extraction, but it redissolves when the organic phases are combined.) The solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford 2 as a light yellow solid (15.3–15.4 g, 90–91%), which is carried on to the next step without further purification.

INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: phosphorus pentachloride & type: pure & mole: 1.1 mole & mass: 234 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: itaconic acid. & type: pure & mole: 0.5 mole & mass: 65 g. &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: to cause reflux & [ settemp ] time: 15 minutes. & [ distill ] pressure: reduced pressure & [ yield ] yield: 60–66%. & mass(yield): 50–55 & [ distill ] N/A: distillation & [ yield ] mass(yield): 47–53 g. & reagent:  ( name: a water-white liquid & note: water-white &  )  & DESCRIPTION: In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a drying tube leading to a gas-absorption trap2 are placed 234 g. (1.1 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of itaconic acid. The reagents are mixed by shaking the flask; after a few minutes a vigorous reaction commences, resulting in partial liquefaction of the mixture and copious evolution of hydrogen chloride. When the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is gently heated to cause reflux of phosphorus oxychloride until all the solid dissolves; then heating is continued for an additional 15 minutes. The reflux condenser is replaced by a 12-in. Vigreux column, and the phosphorus oxychloride is removed by distillation at reduced pressure provided by a water aspirator, the major portion coming over at about 45°/85 mm. When all the phosphorus oxychloride has been removed, the pressure is reduced (vacuum pump) and the material boiling at 70–75°/2 mm. is collected. Liquid boiling in this range weighs 50–55 g., representing a yield of 60–66%. This material, nD20 1.4915, nD25 1.4900, is pure enough for most purposes, but it may be further refined by distillation through a packed column, yielding 47–53 g. of a water-white liquid, nD20 1.4919, boiling at 71–72°/2 mm.

To a 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing 80 mL of absolute ethanol and fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser with a drying tube, potassium metal (7.60 g, 0.19 mol) is slowly added. When the metal has dissolved, the solution is cooled to 0–5°C and (E)-4-acetylpyridine tosylate (55.1 g, 0.19 mol) dissolved (with gentle warming) in 320 mL of absolute ethanol is added over 15 min through a dropping funnel to the stirred solution at 0–5°C. During this period a precipitate of potassium p-toluenesulfonate forms. The temperature of the stirred mixture is allowed to rise to room temperature for 1 hr. The mixture is diluted with 1 L of anhydrous ether and filtered by suction. The precipitate is quickly washed with 150 mL of anhydrous ether. The ether filtrates are combined, and hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the ether solution for 15 min. A precipitate forms immediately. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with three 170-mL portions of anhydrous ether, and dried briefly under reduced pressure. The dihydrochloride thus obtained is dissolved in 200 mL of water, and powdered sodium carbonate is added until the mixture reaches a pH of >10. The mixture is extracted four times with 125-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure to an oil.

The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C (ice-water bath) and to it is added slowly 50 mL of cold water followed by approximately 50 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide solution, which basifies the reaction mixture to approximately pH 11. Saturated sodium chloride solution (approximately 50 mL) is added and the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The lower phase (CH2Cl2 solution) is removed and set aside while the upper, aqueous phase is extracted once with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solution is then filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave crude 2-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (1). The latter is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 110°C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7–13.3 g (81–85%).

In a separate, oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, capped with a rubber septum and vented though a bubbler as described above, a solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol is prepared from 3.05 g of sodium (0.132 mol) and 120 mL of dry ethanol. (Caution: This operation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood. Sodium is a highly reactive metal, avoid exposure to moisture. Hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable and forms explosive mixtures with air, is rapidly evolved. External cooling may be necessary.) The two flasks are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and connected by means of a long double needle-tipped cannula. Magnetic stirring is initiated, and the ethanolic solution of the succinate 2 is cooled in an ice-water bath for 15 min followed by dropwise addition of the solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol which is transferred via the cannula under a very slight positive pressure of nitrogen. Complete transfer of the base should require 2 hr. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0–10°C (bath temperature) and then quenched by the addition of 1.43 mL (0.025 mol) of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is diluted with 900 mL of water, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and extracted four times with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are washed with 100 mL of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give a colorless oil. Vacuum distillation of this crude product affords 17.7–18.7 g (85–90%) of diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3), bp 97–98°C (0.9 mm) [lit.2bp 100–104°C (4 mm)], [α]25D −110° (EtOH, c 5.09), [α]28D −115° (neat) [lit.2 [α]21.5D −88.47° (ether, c 1.030)] which is homogeneous by GLC analysis, and,(Note 14),(Note 15).

A boiling tube is introduced to prevent bumping, and the mixture is heated to boiling in an oil bath which is maintained at 75–85° during the reaction. A solution of 80 g. of aluminum tert-butoxide (p. 48) in 500 ml. of dry benzene is added in one portion to the boiling solution. The mixture turns cloudy and in 10–15 minutes develops a yellow color. Gentle boiling is continued at a bath temperature of 75–85° for a total of 8 hours. The mixture is then cooled, treated with 200 ml. of water and then 500 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid, shaken vigorously, and transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel. The mixture is diluted with 1.5 l. of water and shaken for several minutes, after which the yellow aqueous layer is drawn off into a second separatory funnel and shaken out with a small amount of benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed thoroughly with water and dried by filtration through a layer of sodium sulfate; the solvent is evaporated, the last traces being removed by heating the residue at 60° at the water pump vacuum. The oily yellow residue solidifies when it is cooled in an ice-salt bath and scratched. For crystallization the material is dissolved in a mixture of 70 ml. of acetone and 100 ml. of methanol; the solution is allowed to cool very slowly and is seeded, for otherwise the product tends to separate as an oil. After the bulk of the material has crystallized, the mixture is allowed to stand for 1 day at 0°; the product is then collected, washed with 100 ml. of ice-cold methanol, and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The yield of almost colorless cholestenone, m.p. 77–79°, is 70–81 g. (70–81%). Recrystallization by the same method gives material melting at 78.5–80.5° with 90% recovery and.

However, if fraction VII is refractionated under diminished pressure and the fraction boiling at 123–133°/22 mm. (practically all at 127–129°) is collected and recrystallized as in the following paragraph, a product melting quite sharply at 52° (true m.p. 53°) is obtained.

A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring and fitted with an immersion thermometer, is charged with 88.2 g of the moist solid iodinane oxide 1 , 150 mL of glacial acetic acid , and 300 mL of acetic anhydride. The flask is flushed with dry argon, and maintained under a dry argon atmosphere. Magnetic stirring is commenced, and the mixture is heated to 85°C (internal temperature) over 30 min by means of an oil bath, and kept at this temperature until all the solids dissolve (~20 min) to afford a colorless to clear yellow solution. Heating and stirring are discontinued and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature in the oil bath for 24 hr. A large quantity of colorless crystals separate during this time. The resulting crystalline solids are isolated by careful vacuum filtration in the reaction vessel under argon using a fritted adapter followed by washing the solids with three 80-mL portions of anhydrous ether and subsequent vacuum filtration in the reaction vessel as above,.

INSTRUCTION: [ settemp ] temperature: a slush of ice and water & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ice & type: pure & mass: 200 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. & concentration: concentrated &  )  & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ settemp ] N/A: heated & DESCRIPTION: The flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam.

The nitrogen inlet is briefly removed and 120 g. (1.5 moles) of ammonium nitrate is added; this discharges the chartreuse color. ( Caution: Vigorous foaming occurs.) Ethyl ether (500 ml.) is added and the dry ice condenser is replaced by a standard water-cooled condenser. The ammonia is evaporated by allowing the stirred reaction mixture to warm to room temperature; this takes several hours and it is convenient to have it occur overnight.

The condenser is sealed with a silica gel drying tube, and the stirred solution is put in an oil bath at 105°C. A solution of 0.22 g (2.0 mmol, 0.2 equiv) of potassium tert-butoxide in 20 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) is added dropwise via the funnel during 20 min; the mixture turns red and turbid. After the mixture is heated under reflux for 15 hr, it is allowed to cool to room temperature. Water (30 mL) is added, followed by 5 mL of 2 M HCl. After removal of most of the solvent with a rotary evaporator, the aqueous mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water and brine (each 30 mL). Drying over Na2SO4, filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator affords the crude product. Flash chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (4:1) as eluent affords 1.34 g (8.01 mmol, 80%) of ethyl 4-hydroxy[1-13C]benzoate , mp 112-113°C.

(1.33 moles) of d-tartaric acid and 700 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1400 cc. of water. A 12-l. flask through which cold water is run is placed in the mouth of the kettle in order to prevent loss of water vapor, and the mixture is boiled gently over an open flame for four hours. The solution is now transferred to a 12-l. flask or crock and partially neutralized with 1400 cc. of commercial hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). To the still alkaline solution is now added just enough sodium sulfide to precipitate all the iron or copper which has been dissolved from the kettle. The filtered solution is then just acidified with hydrochloric acid, boiled to expel all hydrogen sulfide, and made very faintly alkaline to phenolphthalein with sodium hydroxide solution. To the hot solution is then added a concentrated solution of 300 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride which causes an immediate precipitation of calcium dl-tartrate and meso-tartrate.

A dry, 4-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a gas-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask is charged with 51 g. (2.11 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. Methyl bromide (200 g., 2.15 moles) is allowed to distill into the continuously stirred reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. The formation of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide requires approximately 2 hours. The gas-inlet tube is then replaced with a dry, 1-l. dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice–salt bath. The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0°), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, then concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 122–136 g. (65–72%) of a mixture of cis- and trans-3-chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid, boiling over the range 48–95° (17–18 mm.), sufficiently pure for use in the next step.

Sodium hydride dispersion, [19.2 g. of a 50% w/w suspension in mineral oil, 9.6 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium hydride] is placed in the flask, and 100 ml. of anhydrous pentane is added. After the dispersion has been stirred, the sodium hydride is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is removed with a pipet or a siphon. This washing operation is repeated with two additional 100-ml. portions of pentane, and 400 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide is then added to the reaction flask. To the vigorously stirred suspension of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide is added, dropwise over 30 minutes, 68 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate. The mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained before all of the previously prepared crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate, dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide, is added in one portion. The resulting solution is slowly heated to 100°, with continuous stirring, over a period of 3 hours. During this time the reaction becomes dark red, and crystalline sodium p-toluenesulfonate separates. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, then transferred to a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual semisolid is mixed with 700 ml. of water and extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column. After removal of a low-boiling forerun, b.p. 54–57° (0.2 mm.), containing mainly ethyl cyanoacetate, 34.5–38.4 g.

The stirrer is started, and 92.5 g. (80 cc., 1 mole) of chloroacetone is run in during thirty minutes. As the reaction proceeds the thiourea dissolves and the temperature rises. The yellow solution is refluxed for two hours and cooled, and, while the mixture is stirred continuously but not so rapidly as to produce a troublesome emulsion, 200 g. of solid sodium hydroxide is added with cooling. The upper, oily layer is separated in a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with ether, using a total of 300 cc.. The dark red oil is combined with the ethereal extract, and the solution is dried over 30 g. of solid sodium hydroxide and filtered by gravity to remove small amounts of tar. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the oil is distilled at reduced pressure. After a very small fore-run, 2-amino-4-methylthiazole is collected at 117–120°/8 mm., or 130–133°/18 mm. The yield of material melting at 44–45° is 80–85.5 g.

With the flask cooled to −10°, a slow current of acetylene is passed through the reaction mixture for 2 hours to sweep out the ammonia. The three-holed stopper is then replaced by a two-holed stopper having a stopcock and an inlet tube reaching to the bottom of the flask and connected with a cylinder of acetylene. The stopper is wired in. The mixture is placed in an ice-salt mixture, the whole being mounted on a shaking machine and agitated vigorously for 10 hours; the mixture is kept under a pressure of 10 lb. of acetylene. Every 30 minutes the pressure is released by means of the stopcock, to sweep out ammonia formed from small amounts of previously unreacted sodium amide.

Bromodiethylsulfonium Bromopentachloroantimonate ("BDSB") ( 1).An oven-dried, one-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar (egg-shaped, 45 mm length and 20 mm diameter) is purged with argon and sealed using a rubber septum and an argon inlet. 1,2-Dichloroethane (200 mL) and bromine (4.27 mL, 13.3 g, 83.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) are syringed into the flask, which is then cooled in a −30 °C dry ice-cooled acetone bath. To this vigorously stirring dark red solution is added diethyl sulfide (9.88 mL, 8.27 g, 91.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv) via syringe over the course of 1 min. The solution instantly lightens to a yellow-orange color. Maintaining the temperature of the bath between -30 and -35 °C by occasionally adding more dry ice, an antimony pentachloride solution (100 mL, 1 M in CH2Cl2, 100 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is cannulated slowly into the reaction flask over 10 min. The color of the solution first darkens to an orange-red, and as the addition proceeds, a yellow precipitate is observed. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at -30 °C for an additional 30 min and then the acetone bath is replaced with a cold water bath (~10 °C). The water bath is heated slowly (~2 °C per min) until all of the precipitate has dissolved (bath temperature = 26-32 °C), yielding a transparent homogeneous red solution. At this time, the rubber septum and argon inlet are quickly replaced with a tightly sealed cap and the flask is moved to a 4 °C refrigerator. After 8 h at 4 °C, the flask (now containing significant amounts of orange crystals) is moved to a -20 °C freezer, where it is kept for 14 h. The crystalline product (1) is isolated by decanting the majority of the solvent and then removing any residual solvent via pipette. The crystals are then washed with cold (-20 °C) CH2Cl2 (2 × 10 mL) and dried under high vacuum (23 °C, 1 mmHg, 2 h) to afford 39.2-39.8 g (86-87%) of pure BDSB (1) as light orange plates.

A suspension of 165 g. (0.5 mole) of o-chloromercuriphenol (p. 161) (m.p. 147° or higher) in 500 cc. of chloroform is placed in the flask and treated with 127 g. (0.5 mole) of iodine, the stirring being continued until a small sample on filtration shows no unreacted iodine. This requires from one to two hours. The solid inorganic mercury compounds are removed by suction filtration. The filtrate is distilled from a 1-l. distilling flask on the water bath to remove most of the chloroform, which is saved for later runs. The residual liquid is shaken vigorously with a solution of 5 g. of potassium iodide in 10 cc. of water, to remove dissolved mercuric iodide. The heavier layer, which still possesses a reddish color, is transferred without drying to a 200-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. At first a small amount of chloroform and water distils over, after which the higher-boiling material is collected in a separate receiver. Small amounts of inorganic mercury compounds remain in the flask.

External cooling is used in order that the water may be added more rapidly. The excess carbon tetrachloride usually refluxes during this part of the procedure. The reaction mixture is then first heated on a steam bath to remove most of the excess of carbon tetrachloride, then the mixture is distilled with steam to carry over the remaining carbon tetrachloride, and to hydrolyze the benzophenone dichloride to benzophenone. The carbon tetrachloride comes over in about thirty minutes but the steam distillation is continued for about one hour to insure complete hydrolysis. The upper benzophenone layer is then separated from the aqueous layer and the latter is extracted with about 200 cc. of benzene. The benzene solution and the benzophenone are transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) for distillation. The benzene and any water that is present are removed under ordinary pressure and the benzophenone is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield is 490–550 g. (80–89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzene) of a product boiling at 187–190° /15 mm., and solidifying to a white solid melting at 47–48°. The material sometimes has a bluish tinge. This color may be removed and a colorless product obtained by moistening the material with benzene and centrifuging.

The residual liquid is then slowly distilled under reduced pressure with a good fractionating column in a 1.5- or 2-l. Claisen flask which must be slightly modified (Fig. 9, p. 130) so that the p-bromophenol after coming in contact with cork or rubber will not be carried into the condenser; if it does, it becomes pinkish. The yield is 1475–1550 g. (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of p-bromophenol boiling at 145–150° /25–30 mm. In addition, there is obtained 250–350 g. of lower-boiling material consisting of a mixture of o-bromophenol and p-bromophenol from which it is very difficult to extract either constituent in pure form, and a small quantity of high-boiling material consisting chiefly of 2,4-dibromophenol. The p-bromophenol on cooling solidifies to a solid white mass containing practically no oil. By centrifuging the product, perfectly dry white crystals are obtained, m.p. 63°. There is also produced in this preparation about 1.5–1.6 l. of hydrobromic acid with a specific gravity of about 1.3.

Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 529) is placed a solution of 98 g. (84.5 cc., 0.8 mole) of ethyl chloroacetate in 200 cc. of absolute alcohol. The solution is cooled to 0° by stirring in a salt-ice bath; and, after the stirrer is stopped, 74 cc. (49 g., 0.83 mole) of trimethylamine, measured after precooling to −5°, is added all at once. The exothermic reaction is controlled sufficiently by cooling so that the temperature of the mixture rises to 60° in the course of about one hour. When there is no longer any heat effect, the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for twenty hours (without replenishment of the condenser ice).
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 950 cc. & mole: 11.7 moles & mass: 1130 g. & concentration: concentrated &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 950 cc. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: aniline & type: pure & volume: 196 cc & mole: 2.15 moles & mass: 200 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: ice. & type: pure & mass: 2 kg. &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: 5° & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium nitrite & type: pure & mole: 2.26 moles & mass: 156 g. &  )  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 700–1000 cc. &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: nitrite & type: pure & concentration: 5 per cent & speed: more slowly &  )  & DESCRIPTION: In a 3- or 5-gallon stoneware crock are placed 950 cc.

The mixture is agitated by a mechanical stirrer, and, as soon as the temperature drops below 5°, a chilled solution of 156 g. (2.26 moles) of sodium nitrite in a measured volume (700–1000 cc.) of water is introduced fairly rapidly from a separatory funnel, the stem of which projects below the surface of the reaction mixture. The addition should not be fast enough to cause the temperature to rise to 10° or to cause evolution of oxides of nitrogen. The last 5 per cent of the nitrite solution is added more slowly, and the reaction mixture is tested with starch-iodide paper at intervals until an excess of nitrous acid is indicated.

The flask is equipped with a water-cooled condenser fitted with a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with argon introduced through the septum and a positive pressure of argon is maintained with an argon-filled balloon. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 24 hr. After complete consumption of starting material, monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC,), the reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with EtOAc (250 mL) and water (125 mL) and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 200 mL of EtOAc and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is recrystallized from 2.5 mL of ether and 250 mL of 20% EtOAc/hexanes to afford ca. 30 g (80%) of 3 as nearly colorless crystals. A second crop totaling 5.9 g (16%, 96% in total) is also obtained.

Ethyl 2-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]propanoate. An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and purged with dry argon. The flask is charged with 10.0 g (84.6 mmol) of (S)-(−)-ethyl lactate, 23.3 g (84.6 mmol) of tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride, 14.4 g (211 mmol) of imidazole, and 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The resulting white suspension is stirred vigorously at 23°C for 2 hr. (At the beginning of the stirring, a heated water bath is useful to maintain the reaction temperature.) The mixture is then filtered through glass wool into 400 mL of water and the solids are washed with two 25-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran. The filtrate is concentrated to remove tetrahydrofuran under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The resulting aqueous suspension is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with two 400-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give 30.0 g (99%) of ethyl 2-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]propanoate as a clear colorless oil.

In an oven dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum are placed 3,6-dibromocarbazole (10.0 g, 31.0 mmol) and sodium hydroxide pellets (1.2 g, 30.0 mmol) in 500 mL of dry acetone under an argon atmosphere. Diethyl sulfate (4.1 mL, 31.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred reaction mixture at room temperature. After the addition, the reaction is stirred for 8 hr at which time all solids are removed by filtration and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL) and successively washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 × 75 mL), brine (3 × 75 mL) and water (3 × 75 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate , filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid. Recrystallization from 95% ethanol (ca. 350 mL) gives 3,6-dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole (8.85 g, 81% yield) as white needles, mp 139-141°C (lit.2 mp 137-138°C). The filtrate is evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized to give additional product (0.24 g, 2% yield).

The contents of the flask are kept cool by the occasional addition of ice while the acid is being introduced. As soon as all the solid has dissolved, the upper oily layer of hexaldehyde acetal is separated. The acetal is hydrolyzed by distilling it with a solution of 100 g. (55 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 700 cc. of water. The free aldehyde distils rapidly, and the distillation is complete when a sample of fresh distillate contains 5 per cent or less of immiscible oil. The distillate is collected in a solution of 100 g. (1 mole) of sodium bisulfite in 300 cc. of water. The mixture is shaken vigorously for several minutes; the oily layer remaining undissolved in the bisulfite solution is principally n-amyl alcohol and is discarded. To remove the remainder of the amyl alcohol and other impurities the bisulfite solution is steam-distilled until 200 cc. of distillate has been collected.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: pentane & type: pure & volume: 100 ml. & note: pure &  ) & reagent:  ( name: ethyl bromide & type: pure & mole: 0.80 mole & mass: 88 g. & note: freshly-distilled &  ) & reagent:  ( name: a solution of 88 g. 0.80 mole of freshly-distilled ethyl bromide in 100 ml. of pure pentane & type: mixture & speed: over a 30-minute period &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: room temperature. & [ settemp ] time: 2 days & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: hydrochloric acid & type: pure & volume: 400 ml. & concentration: 4 N &  )  & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 15 ml. &  )  & phase: the organic phase & [ filter ] N/A: filtered. & [ evaporate ] N/A: removed & [ distill ] N/A: distilled & [ yield ] appearance: a colorless, pungent oil & yield: 64–65% & mass(yield): 35.2–35.8 g. & reagent:  ( name: 3-ethyl-1-hexyne & type: pure &  )  & DESCRIPTION: The clear yellow solution is recooled to 0° in an ice bath before a solution of 88 g. (0.80 mole) of freshly-distilled ethyl bromide in 100 ml. of pure pentane is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-minute period while the solution warms to room temperature. Formation of a precipitate begins after an hour and is virtually complete after 6 hours. After the mixture has been stirred for 2 days, 400 ml. of 4 N hydrochloric acid is carefully added with cooling (ice bath) and stirring. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with 15 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Low-boiling materials are removed by distillation through an efficient Vigreux column. The residue is distilled using a spinning-band apparatus, yielding 35.2–35.8 g.

The solution is heated at reflux, with stirring, for 20–24 hours, then cooled and diluted with 300–350 ml. of benzene. The resulting dark-colored solution is washed with four 500-ml. portions of water, and the combined aqueous layers are extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene. The combined benzene solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 30-cm. Vigreux column or spinning band column. After separation of the unchanged diethyl malonate [119–135 g., b.p. 85–87° (9 mm.)] and intermediate fractions [b.p. 87–104° (9 mm.)], diethyl isopropylidenemalonate is collected as 231–246 g.

It is then crystallized from 2 l. of hot water, filtered, and washed twice with 100-cc. portions of cold water, once with 25 cc. of acetone, and once with 25 cc. of ether. After drying at 110° for one hour, there remains a pure white, anhydrous product weighing 110–120 g. (40–43 per cent of the theoretical amount). An arsenic analysis shows the product to be about 99 per cent pure.
INSTRUCTION: [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: water. & type: pure & volume: 1 l. & note: hot &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: ice-salt mixture. & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ yield ] mass(yield): 350–400 g. & DESCRIPTION: While still hot, the solution is filtered with suction in order to remove the zinc oxide, which is washed with 1 l. of hot water. The filtrate is placed in an enameled pan, saturated with salt, about 3 kg. being required, and cooled to 0° by being placed in an ice-salt mixture. The phenylhydroxylamine, which crystallizes out in long, light yellow needles, is filtered by suction. The yield of crude product varies considerably, depending upon the amount of salt solution present, but averages 350–400 g. This corresponds to 275–300 g. (62–68 per cent of the theoretical amount) of actual phenylhydroxylamine, as determined by its separation from inorganic materials by solution in ether.

(182 cc., 3.55 moles) of bromine. The bromination takes place in the cold with separation of the sparingly soluble 9,10-dibromoanthracene; in order to prevent undissolved anthracene from becoming coated over, it is necessary to maintain vigorous stirring throughout the reaction. A tube from the top of the condenser conducts hydrogen bromide to cold water, in which it is absorbed. The addition of the bromine occupies about one-half hour; the rate is so adjusted that a minimum of bromine is carried over with the hydrogen bromide.

Claisen flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a thermometer dipping into the liquid is attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. In the flask are placed 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, 200 g. (108 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 100 ml. of water. The flask is heated over a wire gauze, and while the internal temperature is maintained at 130–135°, the diazonium solution, in 25-ml. portions, is added at the same rate as the distillate is collected.

(2 moles) of acetophenone and 1 l. of glacial acetic acid. The thermometer is adjusted so that it extends considerably below the surface of the solution, and chlorine is admitted at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 60°. Chlorination is continued until an excess of the halogen has been absorbed. This requires about 5 hours; completion of the reaction is indicated by the development of a yellow color. The reaction mixture is poured over 6 l. of crushed ice in a 2-gal. jar. The mixture is stirred several times and allowed to stand until the ice has melted. The dichloroacetophenone, which separates as a heavy lachrymatory oil, is removed. The yield is 340–370 g. (90–97%). This product, containing only a few per cent of water and acetic acid, is pure enough for the preparation of mandelic acid.

Phosgene is introduced at one end of the apparatus, and gentle suction is applied at the other. In the 5-l. flask, A, 500 cc. of dry ethyl acetate is saturated with phosgene at room temperature. The phosgene is purified by bubbling it through cottonseed oil, B, to remove chlorine, and then through concentrated sulfuric acid, C, as shown in the figure. A solution of 150 g. (1.09 moles) of p-nitroaniline in 1.5 l. of dry ethyl acetate is run in slowly from the separatory funnel, D, over a period of three to four hours. The addition of the p-nitroaniline solution must be at such a rate that the precipitate of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride that is formed at first is allowed to dissolve and not accumulate. During this time a steady stream of phosgene is passed through the solution to ensure an excess. Towards the end of the reaction, the solution must be boiled gently with a Bunsen flame to break up the lumps of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride which otherwise dissolve very slowly.

With the system filled with nitrogen the cylinder valve is opened and approximately 55 ml. (46 g; 0.40 mole) of triethylaluminum is allowed to flow into the reaction flask. The cylinder valve is then closed; the system is evacuated and filled three times with nitrogen, and the adaptor stopcock is then closed. The reaction flask is then quickly removed, stoppered, and weighed to determine the exact amount of triethylaluminum collected. A magnetic stirring bar is added and the flask is fitted with a vacuum take-off and 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The system is again placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the triethylaluminum is dissolved in 150 ml. of anhydrous benzene, added through the dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 11.9 g. (0.441 mole) of hydrogen cyanide in 100 ml. of anhydrous benzene, which is added dropwise to the solution of triethylaluminum, with stirring and cooling. Preferably, the addition is carried out at a constant rate such that the hydrogen cyanide solution is added in about 2 hours. The evolution of ethane becomes slow suddenly after one molar equivalent of hydrogen cyanide is added. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir overnight.

In a 3-l. flask is placed a solution of 115 g. (2.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 175 cc. of water, 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and 108 g. (1.52 moles) of chlorine gas is passed into the mixture. About 80 per cent of the ice is melted by the operation. In a 5-l. flask 110 g. (0.127 mole) of the tin salt of 2,6-dibromo-4-aminophenol is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water and 12 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Solution is effected by warming the mixture to 40–50°, after which it is cooled to 15–17° and 600 g. of ice is added. The sodium hypochlorite solution is then added all at once with vigorous stirring (Hood). A yellow precipitate of 2,6-dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide separates immediately, and chlorine is evolved.

The colorless pentane extracts are combined, washed three times with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with water, and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent furnishes an oil which upon distillation under reduced pressure yields 18.7–22.5 g. of n-pentadecanal, b.p. 103–106° (0.2 mm.). The overall yield from 1-bromotetradecane is 47–55%. The product solidifies eventually and should be kept under an inert atmosphere in the refrigerator.

The vacuum-take-off adapter is attached to a calcium chloride drying tube which is connected to a water aspirator, and the flask is charged with 35.2 g (28.6 mL, 0.40 mol) of pyruvic acid. The pyruvic acid is stirred at room temperature as 46.4 g (36.1 mL, 0.40 mol) of α,α-dichloromethyl methyl ether is added slowly over 30 min. Evolution of hydrogen chloride begins after a few minutes. When the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a glass stopper. The solution is stirred and heated at 50°C in an oil bath for 30 min while a few drops of methyl formate are collected as the first fraction. The condenser is then cooled to −30°C and the receiving flasks are cooled to −50°C with chilled acetone. The aspirator is turned on and the pressure is adjusted to 190 mm. With the oil bath at 50°C, a second fraction, bp 25–35°C (190 mm), is collected. As soon as the head temperature begins to drop, the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the temperature of the oil bath is raised slowly to 75°C. A third fraction, bp 35–40°C (120 mm), consisting mainly of pyruvoyl chloride is collected and. The second and third fractions are combined to give 33–41 g of a mixture of pyruvoyl chloride and methyl formate, which is redistilled through a 1.4- by 18-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The condenser and the receiving flasks are cooled to −5°C with chilled acetone. The first fraction, weighing 2.3–11.4 g and consisting mainly of methyl formate, is collected at 25–30°C (190 mm) with an oil bath temperature of 60°C. When the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the oil bath is maintained at 60°C, 18.6–21.2 g (44–50%) of pyruvoyl chloride, bp 43–45°C (120 mm), distills into the receiver as a light yellow liquid, nD20 1.4165 and.

A 500-mL, oven-dried Airfree® reaction flask containing a magnetic stir bar is charged with molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6, 3.21 g, 12.2 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum, with an argon atmosphere introduced via the side-arm. Triethylamine (Et3N, 220 mL, 1.58 mol) is added, followed by diethyl ether (Et2O, 180 mL), and the mixture is stirred for 10-15 min, until the molybdenum hexacarbonyl has dissolved. The solution is placed in a Rayonet Photochemical Reactor Chamber equipped with 350-nm ultraviolet lamps. The septum is removed under positive argon pressure, and a reflux condenser bearing a rubber septum that has been previously flushed with argon is quickly fitted onto the Schlenk tube. The solution is irradiated for 1 hr under argon while the photochemical reactor interior is cooled with the built-in cooling fan. The light is turned off and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature while maintaining an inert atmosphere to afford a yellow solution of triethylamine-molybdenum pentacarbonyl . The condenser is removed and a septum is quickly refitted while under a positive flow of argon. A solution of 1-phenyl-3-butyn-1-ol (1, 13.50 g, 92.3 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) is injected into the solution, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under a slow argon stream for 72 hr; the solution slowly turns dark red over this period. The solvent is then removed by rotary evaporation, leaving a dark red liquid and a precipitate of molybdenum-containing by-products, which are removed by sublimation by heating under vacuum (35°C, 0.5 mm) The remaining liquid is vacuum distilled through a short-path distillation column (45-47°C, 0.5 mm) to give 2-phenyl-2,3-dihydrofuran (2, 10.3 g, 76% yield) as a clear liquid.

(4 moles) of cyclohexanol and 12 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the flask is connected to a condenser and receiver surrounded by an ice bath. It is then placed in an oil bath which is heated to a temperature of 130–140°. The distillation is continued until only a small residue remains and the odor of sulfur dioxide is apparent. Toward the end of the distillation the temperature of the bath may be raised to 150°. The receiver is kept cold during the entire distillation, which requires from five to six hours.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ethyl benzoate & type: pure & mole: 4 moles & mass: 600 g. & note: freshly distilled &  ) & reagent:  ( name: acetophenone. & type: pure & mole: 0.5 mole & mass: 60 g. & note: freshly distilled &  )  & [ settemp ] N/A: stir & [ settemp ] temperature: oil bath & [ settemp ] temperature: 150–160° & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium ethoxide & type: pure & mole: 0.65 mole & mass: 44 g. & batch:each: 1- to 2-g. portions. &  )  & [ distill ] N/A: distils & DESCRIPTION: In a dry 2-l. three-necked flask are placed 600 g. (4 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl benzoate and 60 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled acetophenone. The flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer which must be rugged enough to stir the reaction mixture even after it becomes very viscous. A condenser for downward distillation is attached to one of the necks, and a 500-ml. filter flask is used as the receiver. This receiver is connected to a water pump through a suction flask carrying a two-holed rubber stopper, one hole of which is left open. The reaction flask is heated in an oil bath kept at 150–160°, and, after the mixture is hot, 44 g. (0.65 mole) of sodium ethoxide is added through the third arm of the flask in 1- to 2-g. portions. The ethoxide addition can be conveniently accomplished with a spoon shaped to enter the arm of the flask or by placing a very short-stemmed large funnel in the third neck and pushing the ethoxide through the funnel with a small glass rod or wire spatula. The reaction mixture becomes orange immediately; ethanol distils after the first few additions, and thereafter the evolution of ethanol is quite vigorous. The additions are made as rapidly as evolution of the ethanol permits. During the ethoxide addition a gentle stream of air is kept passing through the flask by means of a water pump attached to the receiver in order to prevent the ethanol vapor from rising in the third arm of the flask and interfering with the addition.

(0.100 mole) of hexachlorobenzene. The apparatus is flushed with argon or nitrogen before 600 ml. of dry diethyl ether is added. The resulting suspension is stirred and cooled to −72° to −78° in a 4-l. acetone–dry ice bath. A solution of n-butyllithium (0.110 mole) in hexane is added over a 30-minute period such that the temperature does not exceed −70°. The mixture is then allowed to warm to −60° over an additional 1.5 hours. Four liters of dry, thiophene-free benzene is added to the pentachlorophenyllithium solution over a 1-hour interval, during which the temperature rises to ca. + 10°. The mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of at least 14 hours and then is heated at +30° for another 2 hours to ensure complete reaction. A 10-g. portion of solid ammonium chloride is added, and 15 minutes later the contents of the flask are filtered through 20 g. of Celite. The volume of the filtrate is reduced to 75 ml. with a rotary evaporator, and 100 g. of alumina is added to the concentrate in a 250-ml. flask. The rotary evaporation is continued until the weight remains constant and a free-flowing consistency is attained. The material is placed on a column packed with 800 g. of alumina and eluted with low-boiling petroleum ether. Fractions of ca. 200 ml. are collected and analyzed by GC or TLC ((Note 6)), with the appropriate fractions combined and evaporated, providing 16.9–17.5 g. (58–60%,) of essentially pure tetrachlorobenzobarrelene, m.p. 127–129°.

The system is evacuated and refilled with argon three times. By use of a cannula, the solution of geraniol in methanol is introduced into the Schlenk tube containing the ruthenium complex under argon. The resulting light yellow solution is then transferred with a cannula into a 100-mL, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a glass vessel and a magnetic stirring bar by use of a slight positive pressure of argon. The autoclave is connected to a hydrogen source using the arrangement shown in Figure 1, and the air originally present in the gas-inlet tube is replaced by hydrogen. Valve A is opened and hydrogen is introduced until pressure gauge B indicates 100 atm. The solution is stirred at 20°C for 8–16 hr. During hydrogenation, the hydrogen pressure is kept above 90 atm by the occasional introduction of hydrogen from the cylinder. When consumption of hydrogen ceases, the gas-inlet tube is disconnected. Excess hydrogen is carefully released by opening valve A and then the apparatus is disassembled. The yellowish brown contents are transferred to a 50-mL flask and the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 10.7–11.2 g (93–97% yield) of (S)-(−)-citronellol in 98% ee and; bp 58–62°C/0.01 mm.

The oil bath is heated slowly to 130° and is held at this temperature for 30 minutes; foaming and gentle boiling occur. The reaction mixture is cooled, and 200 ml. of water at about 60° is added. The contents of the flask are stirred by means of a glass rod until a clear red solution is obtained. Any traces of tarry material are removed by filtration. The solution is cooled to room temperature, transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and acidified by dropwise addition of 20 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture stands at room temperature a few hours, and then the yellow precipitate of 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with cold water. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide, the crude hydantoin weighs 8.5–8.8 g. (83–86%). It melts at 310–315° (dec.) and is sufficiently pure for the next step and other preparative purposes.

INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: barium hydroxide & type: pure & mass: 700–800 g. &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: mixture & note: well-stirred &  )  & [ filter ] phase: the filtrate & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sulfuric acid & type: pure &  )  & [ wash ] N/A: washed & [ evaporate ] temperature: a steam bath & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium hydroxide & type: pure &  )  & [ filter ] N/A: filtered & [ evaporate ] N/A: evaporated & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: alcohol. & type: pure & volume: 2.5 volumes &  )  & [ settemp ] temperature: ice box & [ wash ] reagent:  ( name: alcohol & type: pure &  )  & [ dry ] N/A: dried & [ evaporate ] N/A: concentrating & [ yield ] yield: 33 per cent & mass(yield): 252 g. & [ yield ] mass(yield): 240 g. & DESCRIPTION: Finely ground barium hydroxide is added gradually to the well-stirred water solution until the material is slightly alkaline to litmus, in order to remove the excess of arsenic acid; when this point is reached, the solution becomes pink. If the procedure is carried out properly, 700–800 g. of Ba(OH)2·8H2O should suffice. The time required by this method is greater than when a hot solution of barium hydroxide is used, but the method is more convenient and does not cause such a great increase in volume. After removal of the barium arsenate by filtration, the mother liquor and washings are treated with sulfuric acid until the solution contains neither barium nor sulfate ions. When the barium sulfate has been separated and thoroughly washed, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to about 3 l., neutralized to litmus with sodium hydroxide, filtered, evaporated until the solution becomes well coated with crystals, and then treated with 2.5 volumes of alcohol. After the mixture has cooled in an ice box, the sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is separated, washed with alcohol, and dried in an oven at 80°. A second crop may be secured from the filtrate by concentrating it further and precipitating with alcohol. The total yield of anhydrous sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is 252 g. (33 per cent of the theoretical amount). By proper manipulation, it is possible to obtain as much as 240 g. in the first crop and to have it free from sulfate, arsenate, and sodium o-hydroxyphenylarsonate which is one of the by-products formed in this reaction.

The remaining neck of the flask is stoppered and the nitrogen is allowed to sweep gently through the flask and out of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask and its contents are cooled to 0°C with an ice bath and stirring is begun. The dropping funnel is charged with sulfuryl chloride (19 mL). The sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise over a 1-hr period to the chilled thiophenol solution with stirring. During this addition, a thick layer of white solid forms. It gradually dissolves as it is broken down. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to stir for 1 hr longer while slowly warming to room temperature. During the course of the addition and subsequent stirring, the clear, pale-yellow solution becomes dark orange-red. The dropping funnel is replaced with an outlet adapter connected to a vacuum pump and the nitrogen inlet is exchanged for a ground glass stopper. The pentane and excess sulfuryl chloride are removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The outlet adapter is replaced by a short-path distillation apparatus adapted for use under reduced pressure. The oily red residue is distilled to give phenylsulfenyl chloride as a blood-red liquid (26 g, 87%), bp 41–42°C (1.5 mm). This compound is stored under nitrogen until used in Part B.

The color of the solution turns from green to black within 15 min and returns gradually to green. After 24 hr, the mixture is poured into cold 3 N hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and extracted with five 50-mL portions of ether. The extracts are combined and washed successively with 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, 50 mL of brine, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed by evaporation and the residue is distilled using a 15-cm Vigreux column to give 2-decanone as a colorless oil (3.0–3.4 g, 65–73%, bp 43–50°C/1 mm and.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: tetrahydrofuran & type: pure & volume: Two hundred milliliters & note: purified &  ) & reagent:  ( name: acetylene is & type: pure & speed: 15–20 l. per hour &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ethylmagnesium bromide & type: mixture & volume: 5 ml. & batch:total: in 1 portion. &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: ethylmagnesium bromide & type: mixture & speed: 3 hours &  )  & DESCRIPTION: After the preparation of ethylmagnesium bromide is completed, the separatory funnel is replaced by a bent tube which reaches the bottom of the flask and is bent at the outer end for downward delivery. The warm (40–50°) solution is forced under nitrogen pressure (by carefully pinching off the tube to the mercury bubbler) into the 500-ml. separatory funnel which has been prepared for attachment to the 1-l. flask. After all the solution has passed into the separatory funnel, nitrogen flow is allowed to continue briefly in order to displace the air above the solution, then the funnel is stoppered loosely and attached to the 1-l. flask. Two hundred milliliters of purified tetrahydrofuran is now placed in the flask, acetylene is introduced through the gas-inlet tube at the rate of 15–20 l. per hour, and the stirrer is started. After 5 minutes, about 5 ml. of the solution of ethylmagnesium bromide is added in 1 portion. Almost at once, there appears a froth of ethane which is easily distinguishable from the larger bubbles of acetylene. When the frothing subsides, portionwise addition of the ethylmagnesium bromide solution is continued until the total solution has been added. This requires about 3 hours, and the temperature of the reaction rises 5–10° above room temperature. The solution of ethynylmagnesium bromide is homogeneous at 30°.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: commercial acetone & type: pure & volume: 1500 cc & mole: 20.5 moles & mass: 1190 g. &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: barium hydroxide; & type: pure &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: three-quarters full of the same substance & mass: three-quarters full &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: glass wool. & type: mixture &  )  & DESCRIPTION: A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a Soxhlet extractor which in turn is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser. In the flask are placed 1190 g. (1500 cc., 20.5 moles) of commercial acetone and a few pieces of porous plate to produce even boiling. Two of the usual paper thimbles are placed in the extractor, one above the other. The lower one is filled nearly full of barium hydroxide; the top one is filled about three-quarters full of the same substance, and the remainder of the space is filled with glass wool.
INSTRUCTION: [ add ] reagent:  ( name: sodium hydroxide & type: pure & mole: 20 moles & mass: 890 g. & concentration: 90 per cent &  ) & reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: 1 l. &  )  & [ add ] N/A: diluting & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: phenolphthalein & type: pure & note: A few drops of &  )  & [ settemp ] N/A: cooled & [ evaporate ] N/A: remove & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: water & type: pure & volume: three or four volumes &  ) & reagent:  ( name: phenolphthalein & type: pure & note: a drop more of &  )  & [ add ] reagent:  ( name: phenolphthalein & type: pure & note: a drop more of &  )  & DESCRIPTION: In the meantime, a sodium sulfite solution is prepared by dissolving 890 g. (20 moles) of sodium hydroxide, of about 90 per cent purity, in about 1 l. of water and then diluting to 6 l. A few drops of phenolphthalein solution are added and sulfur dioxide passed in, first until an acid reaction is indicated and then for two or three minutes longer. During the addition of the sulfur dioxide, the solution is cooled with running water. On account of the strong alkaline solution, the original color produced by the phenolphthalein is very faint, but this slowly increases until it becomes deep just before the acid point is reached. It is best to remove a small sample of the liquid from time to time, dilute with three or four volumes of water, and add a drop more of phenolphthalein.

There remains a slightly yellow oil which soon solidifies. The yield is 164–173 g. (82–87 per cent of the theoretical amount) of veratraldehyde melting at 43–44.5°. This product is sufficiently pure for many purposes, but it can be purified further with slight loss by distillation under diminished pressure. From 164 g. of the above product there is obtained 156 g. of pure veratraldehyde, boiling at 153°/8 mm. and melting at 46°. Since this aldehyde is easily oxidized in the air it should be stored in a tightly corked or sealed container.

(1 mole) of dry α-phenylacetoacetonitrile (m.p. 88.5–89.5°) (p. 487) are added. The neck is temporarily closed by a cork, and the nitrile is dissolved by warming with stirring. The flask is then surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the solution vigorously stirred, so that any nitrile which crystallizes will be finely divided. When the temperature reaches −10°, the inlet tube is inserted and a stream of dry hydrogen chloride passed through, with moderate stirring, at such a rate that the bubbles rising from the 6-mm. tubing in the sulfuric acid wash bottle can just be counted. This is continued for five to eight hours until the mixture is saturated. The ice bath is then removed, stirring continued until all the solid has dissolved (about one hour), and the flask allowed to stand overnight.

Approximately 500 g. of cracked ice is added, and then, with mechanical stirring, the diazonium salt solution is run in as rapidly as possible. The mixture becomes a bright orangered. The flask is now warmed to about 20° on a steam bath, until the solid sodium sulfite, which has separated while cooling, redissolves. The total amount of liquid is now about 10 l. One-half of this is poured into another 12-l. flask, and both halves are warmed on the steam bath to 60–70°, until the color becomes quite dark (thirty to sixty minutes). Sufficient hydrochloric acid (300–400 cc.) is now added to each flask to make the solutions acid to litmus. The heating is continued and the color gradually becomes lighter until, after four to six hours, the solutions have become nearly colorless; they may be heated overnight, if desired.

The temperature of the mixture is maintained at 70–75° by intermittent cooling until nearly all the acetoacetanilide has been added. The last 10–15 g. is added without cooling, and the temperature rises to 95°; the addition requires 20–30 minutes. The heat of reaction maintains the temperature at 95° for about 15 minutes; the reaction mixture is then kept an additional 15 minutes at 95° by external heating. After the solution has cooled to 65°, it is poured into 5 l. of water with vigorous stirring.

Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated. Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.

(0.45 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate (p. 235) and 114 g. (0.45 mole) of hydroxyhydroquinone triacetate (p. 317). This requires several minutes of stirring. To this mixture is added 450 cc. of 75 per cent sulfuric acid. The paste slowly dissolves with the evolution of heat, giving a deep red solution; the latter is heated on a warm bath with occasional stirring until it reaches 80°, at which temperature it is maintained for one-half hour. It is then allowed to cool to room temperature and poured into 1850 cc. of cold water.

The reaction vessel is evacuated and the contents are briefly heated with a Bunsen burner flame. After 30 min the vacuum is replaced by nitrogen and the apparatus is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and two rubber septa. Dry tetrahydrofuran (260 mL) is added, and the resulting green solution containing a small amount of undissolved solid is cooled with an ice bath while 84 mL of a 2.8 M solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran is added rapidly via syringe over 1–2 min.

A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. The flask is charged with 420 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and the solvent is cooled to −62°C in an acetone–dry ice bath. Tungsten hexachloride (60g, 0.15 mol) is then introduced. While the cold suspension is stirred, 31 mL (0.30 mol) of 90% butyllithium in hexane is added slowly from a hypodermic syringe. The rate of addition (complete in ca. 5 min) is such that the temperature remains below −15°C. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. The green-brown viscous suspension becomes a dark-brown homogeneous solution that eventually turns green at room temperature. Because the reaction with the epoxide is exothermic, the flask is momentarily returned to the acetone–dry ice bath while 14.8 g (0.081 mol) of trans-cyclododecene oxide and is introduced with a hypodermic syringe. The cooling bath is again removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature.

As a single portion, 71.0 g (0.5 mol) of solid phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) is added with stirring. The resulting mixture, which becomes quite viscous because of the insoluble P2O5, is stirred at 0°C for 10 min, then warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 7 hr during which time the viscosity of the mixture decreases. The mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, 200 mL of water is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted three times with 50 mL of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed successively with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and carefully concentrated with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (20–30 mm) at room temperature.

The flask is placed in a large oil bath and connected to a condenser for distillation. The temperature of the oil is raised quickly to 180–190°, at which point distillation starts. The bath is held at this temperature until practically no more aniline and water distil (about two hours), and then the temperature is slowly raised to 225° and maintained at this temperature until no further distillation takes place (one to two hours). The oil bath is now removed and the contents of the flask are allowed to cool below 180° and 550 g. (5.9 moles) of aniline is added. The distillations at 190° and 225° are repeated (about six hours). The hot mixture is poured into two 20-cm. evaporating dishes (Hood) and is allowed to cool. The crude product weighs 1600–2000 g., depending on the amount of aniline retained.
