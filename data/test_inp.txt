(B) Reduction of Cinnamic Acid.—After the apparatus is assembled, 2 l. of 7–8 per cent sodium sulfate solution is placed in the battery jar and the porous cup is filled to the same level with more of this solution. The stirrer is started, and 200 g. (1.35 moles) of a good grade of cinnamic acid is suspended in the catholyte. A solution of 35 g. (0.88 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 150 cc. of water is then added at such a rate as to avoid forming lumps of sodium cinnamate. The current is turned on and the rheostat adjusted until a steady current of 5 to 10 amperes is flowing. From this point only occasional attention is required. The suspended sodium cinnamate and cinnamic acid gradually dissolve as the reduction proceeds. Portions adhering to the walls of the cell should be worked down with a stirring rod and finally with a little water from a wash bottle. The liquor inside the porous cup should be kept alkaline by adding very concentrated sodium hydroxide solution at about one-half hour intervals. About 110 g. (2.7 moles) will be required. The reduction will require 76 to 80 ampere-hours; considerable hydrogen is evolved near the end. The temperature need not be controlled.
A. 3-Methyl-1-phenyl-4-penten-1-ol (1).2 An oven-dried, 300-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a rubber septum, an air condenser (fitted with a three-way stopcock connected to a nitrogen balloon), and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with Ni(acac)2 (180 mg, 0.7 mmol). The apparatus is purged with nitrogen and the flask is charged successively via syringe with freshly distilled THF (100 mL), isoprene (5 mL, 50 mmol), and benzaldehyde (2.65 g, 25 mmol). Triethylborane (50 mL, 1 M hexane solution; 50 mmol) is added via syringe over 5 min while the solution is stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Stirring is continued for 30 h at ambient temperature. After the reaction is completed, most of the solvents and the remaining reagents (isoprene and Et3B) are removed with a rotary evaporator. The residual mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (60 mL). The organic phase is washed with 4 M KOH (2 × 50 mL) and brine (2 × 30 mL), and then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is distilled by means of a Kugelrohr apparatus (90–100 °C/0.03 mmHg) to give 3-methyl-1-phenyl-4-penten-3-ol (1) (3.89–4.05 g, 88–92%) consisting of anti- and syn-isomers in a ratio of 30:1.
Tetrahydrofuran (36 g., 0.5 mole) is added to a mixture of potassium iodide (332 g., 2 moles), 85% orthophosphoric acid (231 g., 135 ml., 2 moles), and phosphoric anhydride (65 g.),, and in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer. The mixture is stirred and heated at its reflux temperature for 3 hours, during which time a dense oil separates from the acid layer. The stirred mixture is cooled to room temperature, and 150 ml. of water and 250 ml. of ether are added. The ether layer is separated, decolorized with dilute aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, washed with cold saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask. The portion boiling at 108–110°/10 mm. is collected. The yield of colorless 1,4-diiodobutane (nD20 1.615; d420 2.300) is 143–149 g. (92–96%).
When all the bromobenzene has been added, there is added slowly through the separatory funnel a solution of 114 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled antimony trichloride (m.p. 67–73°) in 300 cc. of dry ether. The reaction proceeds smoothly and even briskly with the freshly distilled chloride. However, if the latter has not been freshly prepared, gentle warming may be required to start the reaction. When all the antimony trichloride has been added (one to two hours), the mixture is heated on the steam bath for one hour longer.
2-(Ethoxycarbonyl)prop-2-en-1-yl phenyl sulfone 1 from Step A (13.7 g, 54 mmol) is added via syringe, and the mixture is heated to reflux. Air (40 mL, 0.33 mmol O2) is introduced over 1 h by a syringe pump with the needle of the syringe placed through the stopcock and immersed just under the surface of the liquid. After 15–20 min, the clear yellow mixture turns black. After 1 h, the mixture is cooled and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (35 °C, bath temperature). The resulting black oil is dissolved in a minimum of dichloromethane (~20 mL). The solution is charged onto a column (8 × 9 cm) of 200 g silica gel, and the column is eluted with tert-butyl methyl ether/cyclohexane 1:19. Fractions containing the product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, bath temperature) and dried under high vacuum to provide 8.70–8.75 g compound 2 (77–78%) as a colorless oil.
B. α-Bromo-β-methylvaleric acid. In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and dropping funnel and placed on a steam cone, 250 g. of technical potassium hydroxide is dissolved in 200 ml. of water. To the hot solution, 250 g. (1.16 moles) of diethyl sec-butylmalonate is added in a steady stream with vigorous stirring. A tube connected to a vacuum line assists in the removal of ethanol. The mixture is stirred and heated for 5 hours, and then the contents of the flask are transferred to a beaker fitted with a stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The cooling is hastened by the addition of 50 g. of ice, and, when the temperature reaches 15°, technical hydrochloric acid is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20°. After the addition of about 250 ml. of acid, the monopotassium salt separates, necessitating stirring by hand until solution again occurs. When the solution is acid to Congo red it is transferred to a separatory funnel.
A. Potassium 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanolate. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped for simple vacuum distillation is charged with a solution of 25.4 g. (0.390 mole) of 86% potassium hydroxide and in 50 ml. of water, to which is added 100.0 g. (0.4098 mole) of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanol. The colorless solution obtained is concentrated to a syrup by vacuum distillation at aspirator pressure. Further evacuation with a vacuum pump with heating to 140° results in a white solid; under the greater vacuum volatile substances can be collected in a trap immersed in an acetone-dry ice bath. The trap must be cleaned or be replaced several times during the first hour. After drying the white solid at 140° for 12 hours, the flask is transferred to a glove bag equipped with a mortar and pestle, a vacuum adapter, a powder funnel, a spatula, and a tared, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. Under a dry nitrogen atmosphere the white solid is ground to a fine powder, transferred to the 500-ml. flask, and dried on a vacuum pump (10−2 mm.) to constant weight, yielding 107–109 g. (97–99%) of potassium 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-phenyl-2-propanolate as a white powder.
(A) Glutamic Acid Hydrochloride.—A mixture of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 100 g. (corrected for moisture) of gluten flour is boiled under reflux for six hours. When the solution has cooled to room temperature it is treated with 20 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtered by suction through two thicknesses of linen covered with a thin layer of infusorial earth; 15 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is employed for rinsing the flask and washing the residue. The light yellow filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to 175 cc. and allowed to stand overnight at −8°. The crystals which separate, amounting to 25–26 g., are filtered off on hardened paper. The mother liquor is further concentrated to 75 cc. and again allowed to stand overnight at −8°. A second crop amounting to 16–18 g. is thus obtained. Further concentration yields no more crystals.
B. 3-Butyroyl-1-methylpyrrole (2). A 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser and arranged for magnetic stirring and heating. The flask is charged with 50 mL of pentane and 2.0 g (13 mmol) of 1. To the rapidly stirred solution is added 16 g (180 mmol) of activated manganese(IV) oxide in small portions over 5 min. The solution is heated at reflux for 18 hr and then an additional 8 g (90 mmol) of activated manganese(IV) oxide is added in portions. After being heated at reflux for 24 hr, the reaction mixture is filtered through a 2-cm Celite filter pad. The filtered manganese oxides are thoroughly washed with about 200–300 mL of dichloromethane. Evaporation of solvent from the combined filtrates leaves 1.4–1.6 g of a light yellow oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation at 100°C/0.1 mm gives 1.27–1.40 g (8.4–9.3 mmol, 64–71% yield) of an oil (2).
A. N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2-bromopyrrole. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two solid addition funnels, and a three-way stopcock attached to a balloon filled with nitrogen. To the flask are added 4.5 g (67.2 mmol) of pyrrole and 180 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen. The stirred solution is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath and a catalytic amount (ca. 0.1 g) of azoisobutyronitrile (AIBN) is added via a solids addition funnel. After 5 min, 9.57 g (33.6 mmol) of 1,3-dibromo-5,5-dimethylhydantoin is added over a 20-min period via a solids addition funnel. The light-green mixture is stirred for an additional 10 min, then allowed to stand for 2 hr, keeping the temperature below −50°C. The solution is filtered by suction into a dry, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask that has been cooled to −78°C in a dry ice-acetone bath. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a three-way stopcock attached to a balloon filled with nitrogen. To the stirred dark-green solution is added 2.71 g (26.9 mmol) of triethylamine followed immediately by addition of 20.4 g (93.9 mmol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and a catalytic amount (ca. 0.1 g) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen. The mixture is stirred for 8 hr while it is allowed to warm to room temperature. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature and 100 mL of hexane is added to the crude product, which is washed with deionized water (3 × 100 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature. The crude product is purified by chromatography on amine-treated neutral silica (270 g) using hexane as the eluent. The fractions containing the product are identified by TLC, combined, and concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature to yield compound 1 as a colorless oil (13.5–14.7 g, 82–89%).
A. (+)-Diisopinocampheylborane. A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring, and with a nitrogen inlet vented through a mercury bubbler, a rubber septum, and a thermometer, is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 13.75 g (0.101 mol) of (−)-α-pinene and 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran,(Note 2),(Note 3)). The mixture is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, magnetic stirring is initiated, and 58.0 mL (0.055 mol) of 0.95 M borane-tetrahydrofuran solution is added via syringe at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below 5°C. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stir for 2 hr to ensure complete reaction.2
The suspension is slowly poured into 600 ml. of saturated ammonium chloride solution which has previously been cooled to 10–15°, and the mixture is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of diethyl ether. Concentration of the combined extracts gives the crude addition product, which is added to 200 ml. of ice-cold water and quickly acidified with cold 3 N hydrochloric acid. The acidic solution is rapidly extracted with 300 ml. of cold hexane, and the extract is discarded. The aqueous solution is then made basic by the addition of aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide solution, and the mixture is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. Concentration of the combined ethereal extracts affords 70–75 g. of crude oxazolidine.
B. 3β-Acetoxy-18-iodo- and 18-hydroxy-18,20β-oxido-5-pregnene. In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser are placed 3 l. of cyclohexane, 180 g. (ca. 0.37 mole) of commercial lead tetraacetate containing approximately 10% acetic acid, 24 g. (0.095 mole) of iodine and 30 g. (0.083 mole) of 3β-acetoxy-20β-hydroxy-5-pregnene. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated to the boiling point by irradiation with a 1000-watt lamp from underneath. When the iodine color has disappeared (usually after about 60–90 minutes), the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, filtered with suction, and the filter residue with 600 ml. of cyclohexane. The filtrate is washed with two 500-ml. portions of 5% sodium thiosulfate solution and then with water. The combined aqueous solutions are extracted once with 500 ml. of ether. To the combined organic layers is added 6 ml. of pyridine, the solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent evaporated under reduced pressure at a bath temperature of 35–40° (preferably by using a rotary evaporator). About 60 g. of an oily residue, which is immediately oxidized, is obtained.
C. 1,3,5-[Tris-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-piperazine]-triazine. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser, temperature probe, glass stopper and static nitrogen inlet is charged with cyanuric chloride (10.0 g, 54.2 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and tetrahydrofuran (1 L). N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-piperazine (34.0 g, 183 mmol, 3.38 equiv) is added in ~10 g portions over 17 min (during the addition, the temperature rose from 20 to 28 °C; an ambient temperature water bath was used to moderate the exotherm). White solids are formed in the reaction mixture during the addition of the piperazine. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (96.2 mL, 552 mmol, 10.2 equiv) is added, and the reaction mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 1 h, then heated to an internal temperature of 66 °C for 20 h at which point the reaction was judged to be complete by HPLC. Upon cooling to ambient temperature, a white precipitate forms. The solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator at 31 °C. The white residue is taken up in dichloromethane (300 mL) and washed with water (2 × 150 mL), 10% NaHSO4 (2 × 150 mL) and a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium chloride (2 × 100 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator at 35-41 °C. The resulting white solids are granulated in EtOAc (35 mL, ca. 1 mL/g) to yield a white crystalline material (31.0-32.0 g, 90-93 %), mp 223.4-226.1 °C.
In a 5-l. flask is placed 3 kg. (2860 cc., 50.0 moles) of glacial acetic acid and to this is added a weight of ammonium carbonate corresponding to 400 g. (23.5 moles) of ammonia. The flask is fitted with a one-hole stopper holding an efficient fractionating column 90 cm. long with condenser and receiver. An air condenser 150–200 cm. long may be employed. The mixture in the flask is heated to gentle boiling and the flame so regulated that the rate of distillation does not exceed 180 cc. per hour. The distillation is continued in this way for eight to ten hours, until the temperature at the head of the column reaches 110°. The distillate, which is a mixture of water and acetic acid, amounts to 1400–1500 cc. The receiver is changed, the flame under the flask is gradually increased, and the distillation is continued at about the same rate until the temperature at the head of the column rises to 140°. The distillate, which amounts to 500–700 cc., is largely acetic acid and may be used in the next run.
A 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a condenser arranged for distillation, a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer. Connections are most conveniently made with ground-glass joints, and the flask is heated on a steam cone. Cupric bromide (0.4 g.), 39.2 g. (0.60 g. atom) of freshly sand-papered zinc foil cut into narrow strips, and 1.2 l. of benzene previously dried over sodium are added to the flask. To dry the apparatus and contents, 300 ml. of benzene is slowly distilled from the flask with stirring. Heating is interrupted, and the condenser is quickly arranged for reflux and fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. To the flask are added rapidly with stirring 38.9 g. (0.40 mole) of n-capronitrile and 125.4 g. (0.60 mole) of sec-butyl α-bromopropionate. Refluxing is resumed, and after a 3–5 minute induction period blackening of the zinc surface and clouding of the solution are noted as the first signs of reaction. Heating is maintained a total of 45 minutes, after which the solution is cooled for 15 minutes in an ice bath.
A. Benzyloxymethoxy 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether. An oven-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a thermometer (−100 °C to 30 °C range), a rubber septum (containing nitrogen inlet and outlet needles) and a glass stopper is charged with sodium hydride (3.8 g, 95 mmol, 1.2 equiv) by temporary removal of the septum and 10 mL of pentane is added by syringe through the septum. The resulting gray suspension is stirred for 1 min and is allowed to settle. The pentane is slowly removed by syringe and the process is repeated. Tetrahydrofuran (300 mL) is added and the resulting gray suspension cooled to 0 °C (internal temperature) using an ice-water-sodium chloride bath whereupon 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (6.4 mL, 87 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added drop wise via syringe at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 0 °C (approximately 10 min) [caution: gas evolution!]. When effervescence ceases the cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to warm to 22 °C (approximately 15 min) giving a slightly turbid, light gray mixture. The mixture is cooled to 0 °C with an ice-water-sodium chloride bath and benzyl chloromethyl ether (11.0 mL, 79 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added dropwise over 5 min by syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 30 min to produce a fine white suspension. The cooling bath is removed and the suspension is allowed to warm to 22 °C and is stirred for 1.75 h. The septum is removed and water (70 mL) is added. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and then extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 70 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 15 min, filtered and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrates are concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the residual colorless oil (19.3 g) is purified by short path distillation. The fraction boiling at 79-80 °C/15 mmHg is collected to afford 15.8 g (72 mmol, 91%) of pure benzyloxymethoxy 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl ether.
The flask is then cooled to −5°, and a solution of 200 g. (4.5 moles) of acetaldehyde in 250 cc. of dry ether is added at this temperature over a period of one hour.
B. 4-Ethoxy-3-hydroxybenzaldehyde. A 100-ml., three-necked flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with an argon inlet, a rubber septum, and a ground-glass stopper in the center neck is evacuated, flame-dried, and allowed to cool under a positive pressure of argon, which is maintained throughout the following sequence. Using a syringe, 30 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran and 5.0 ml. (0.029 mole) of diphenylphosphine are added through the septum. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled with an ice bath, and 15 ml. (0.032 mole) of cold 2.1 M n-butyllithium–hexane solution is added by syringe over ca. 3 minutes. Stirring is continued as the red solution is allowed to warm to room temperature over about 30 minutes before 5.0 g. (0.022 mole) of 4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ethylene acetal is added through the center neck. The flask is stoppered, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours.
C. (−)-(E,S)-3-(Benzyloxy)-1-butenyl phenyl sulfone . As described in ref. 4, a flame-dried, 500-mL Schlenk flask (or three-necked flask with a thermometer) equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel sealed with a rubber septum, and an argon balloon is charged under an atmosphere of argon with 13.1 g (151 mmol) of lithium bromide and 36.6 g (125 mmol) of diethyl [(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]phosphonate. The reagents are suspended in 250 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile and 19.1 mL (13.9 g, 138 mmol) of triethylamine is then added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature until it becomes homogeneous and is then cooled to 0°C (an ice-salt bath is used to maintain the internal temperature at 0°C). The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 20.6 g (125 mmol) of (−)-(S)-2-(benzyloxy)propanal in 50 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile . The aldehyde solution is added dropwise at 0°C with vigorous stirring. After complete addition the reaction mixture is stirred for ca. 12 hr and allowed to warm to room temperature during this period. The reaction is monitored by TLC and is halted by the addition of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (150 mL) and water (150 mL). The reaction mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (200 mL). After phase separation, the aqueous phase is reextracted with diethyl ether (4 × 200 mL) and the combined organic extracts are washed with aqueous saturated NaCl solution (200 mL). After drying over MgSO4, filtration, and removal of the solvents under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, the crude product is purified by column chromatography using a 15 : 1 (w/w) ratio of silica gel to crude product and 1:2 → 1:1 (v/v) diethyl ether/light petroleum as eluent to yield 34.2 g (90%) of the pure (E)-isomer as a colorless viscous oil.
Fourteen milliliters (22 g., 0.10 mole) of 57% hydriodic acid is added to the filtrate, and the resulting solution is stored at −20° for 1 hour. The solid that separates is collected; weight 15.5–17.5 g. Recrystallization of this solid from about 100 ml. of absolute ethanol gives 14–16 g. (63–72%) of 1-aminopyridinium iodide as almost-white crystals, m.p. 160–162°.
A 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, bubble counter, and a stopper is charged with 1.6 L of tap water, 300 g of sucrose, and 200 g of baker's yeast, which are added with stirring in this order. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at about 30°C, 20.0 g (0.154 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate is added, and the fermenting suspension is stirred for another 24 hr at room temperature. A warm (ca. 40°C) solution of 200 g of sucrose in 1 L of tap water is then added, followed 1 hr later by an additional 20.0 g (0.154 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate. Stirring is continued for 50–60 hr at room temperature. When the reaction is complete by gas chromatographic analysis, the mixture is worked up by first adding 80 g of Celite and filtering through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 4, 17-cm diam). After the filtrate is washed with 200 mL of water, it is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with five 500-mL portions of ethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 35°C bath temperature to a volume of 50–80 mL. This residue is fractionally distilled at a pressure of 12 mm through a 10-cm Vigreux column, and the fraction boiling at 71–73°C (12 mm) is collected to give 24–31 g (59–76%) of (S)-( + )-ethyl 3-hydroxybutanoate and; the specific rotation [α]25D + 37.2° (chloroform, c 1.3) corresponds to an enantiomeric excess of 85%.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient Liebig condenser (100 by 1 cm.), 228 g. (2 moles) of methyl n-amyl ketone (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 351) is dissolved in a mixture of 600 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and 200 cc. of water. One hundred thirty grams (5.6 gram atoms) of sodium in the form of wire is gradually added through the condenser. During the addition of the sodium the flask is cooled with running water so that the reaction does not become unduly violent.
A. 2,2-Dimethylethylenimine. A cold mixture of 110 g. (60 ml., 1.06 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid and 200 ml. of water is added in portions, with shaking, to a solution of 100 g. (107 ml., 1.12 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is fitted with a thermometer extending into the liquid and a short still head carrying a downward condenser.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel is placed a mixture of 45.1 g. (0.45 mole) of a dihydroxycyclopentene mixture, 200 ml. of water, and 300 ml. of methylene chloride. After this mixture has been cooled to −5° to 0° by means of an external cooling bath, the addition of a solution of 100 g. (1.0 mole) of chromium trioxide and 160 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 450 ml. of water is begun. The solution of the oxidant is added dropwise, and with stirring, at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains between −5° and 0°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at −5° to 0° for 1 hour and then 200 ml. of chloroform is added. The resulting mixture is stirred for 10 minutes, the organic layer is separated, and then the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of a mixture (1:1 by volume) of chloroform and methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are washed with 100 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature. The yield of 2-cyclopentene-1,4-dione, which crystallizes as yellow plates melting at 30.0–32°, is 17–22 g. (39–50% based on the dihydroxycyclopentene mixture).
C. 2-[3-(3-Bromophenyl)-2H-azirin-2-yl]-5-(trifluoromethyl)pyridine (3). A 250-mL, oven-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with nitrogen inlet, a thermometer, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stir bar is charged with oxime (2) (12.0 g, 33.4 mmol) and dry dichloromethane (50 mL). The cloudy yellow solution is cooled in an ice bath and triethylamine (18.6 mL, 133 mmol) is added dropwise over 10 min via syringe. Following the triethylamine addition, all solids had dissolved, and stirring is continued at 0 °C for 15 min. Trifluoroacetic anhydride (5.7 mL, 41 mmol) is then added dropwise over 10 min via syringe. The solution darkened in color as the reaction proceeded. After 30 min of stirring, the flask is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for an additional 60 min. Only trace starting material remained as determined by TLC: product (3) Rf = 0.25 (9:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate). The reaction is then quenched by the addition of water (20 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (2 × 15 mL), and the combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (20 g), filtered, and concentrated (35 °C, 20 mmHg). Celite (10 g) and methylene chloride (40 mL) are added to the resulting dark red oil and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 20 mmHg). The adsorbed material is loaded onto a column and purified using silica gel chromatography (330 g silica gel, 25 cm × 6 cm, start 20:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate to 5:1 gradient, 100 mL/min, 30 min, 3 L total solvent volume) to give (3) as a dark orange oil (8.61 g 76%).
A 500-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an air-tight mechanical stirrer, a gas dispersion tube with a porous glass frit, a Dimroth reflux condenser, and a thermometer, making sure all joints are greased with silicone grease. The top of the condenser is connected to a series of three traps with polyvinyl chloride tubing. The first trap is empty, and the other two contain aqueous 10 N sodium hydroxide. The gas dispersion tube extends to near the bottom of the flask, just above the stirrer blade, and is connected to a gas-mixing chamber having two inlet tubes, one for oxygen and the other for chlorine. The flask is charged with 47.1 g. (0.200 mole) of ε-benzoylaminocaproic acid and 200 ml. of 1,2-dichloroethane. The solution is stirred and heated to 60–70°, before 25.5 g. (0.219 mole) of chlorosulfonic acid is added gradually. A 2:1 (v/v) mixture of gaseous chloride and oxygen is bubbled into the flask for 3 hours while the contents are stirred and heated at reflux. The chlorine-oxygen gas flow is discontinued, and nitrogen is passed through the reaction mixture for 1 hour at 60–70° to remove chlorine remaining in solution. The flask is stoppered, allowed to stand for 1 hour at room temperature, and stored in a refrigerator for 12 hours. The supernatant liquid is removed, and ca. 800 ml. of aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide is added to the solid remaining in the flask with ice cooling. Nitrogen is bubbled through the alkaline solution for 30 minutes to expel 1,2-dichloroethane. The solution is decolorized with 5 g. of activated carbon, mixed with ca. 400 g. of ice, and acidified to a pH of ca. 6 with 6 N hydrochloric acid. If available, a few seed crystals of ε-benzoylamino-α-chlorocaproic acid are added to the solution to facilitate crystallization. After 1 hour, more 6 N hydrochloric acid is added gradually until the pH is lowered to 1. An hour later the precipitate is filtered and washed thoroughly with 300 ml. of cold water until sulfate ion in the aqueous wash is no longer detectable with a test solution of barium chloride.
C. (1R,2S,5R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)cyclohexyl chloroacetate 5. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a calcium chloride tube, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, a thermometer, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 20.0 g (86 mmol) of 3/4, 10.5 g (86 mmol) of N,N-dimethylaniline, and 30 mL of diethyl ether. This stirred mixture is cooled to 0°C and a solution of 10.5 g (93 mmol) of chloroacetyl chloride in 30 mL of diethyl ether is added at such a rate that this temperature is maintained. After the reaction is stirred at 0°C for an additional hr, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, during which time N,N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride precipitates. The reaction is completed by heating to reflux for 3 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the crystalline white residue is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and 60 mL of water. The phases are separated and the organic phase is washed thoroughly with an equal volume of water; then it is washed until it is acid-free with a saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. It is concentrated under reduced pressure to give about 25.0 g of a viscous oil, which crystallizes on addition of 30 mL of 90% aqueous ethanol. The crystals are filtered with suction to yield 18.6–21.8 g (70–82%) of the chloroacetate as a mixture of diastereomers. Diastereo- and enantiomerically pure chloroacetate 5 is obtained in 48% yield by two fractional crystallizations of the diastereomeric chloroacetates from ethanol, mp 82–83°C; [α]D20 + 22.4° (CCl4, c 2.29).
A 2-l., four-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser is charged with 296 g. (2.00 moles) of cinnamic acid and 600 ml. of dichloromethane. The mixture is heated to reflux and a solution of 290 g. (2.05 moles) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in 100 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise, with stirring, over a period of 45 minutes. After a few minutes the solution becomes clear and, after about one-half of the isocyanate has been added, the carboxylic acid amide N-sulfonyl chloride begins to precipitate. At the end of the addition, the reaction mixture is heated for an hour to complete the evolution of carbon dioxide. N,N-Dimethylformamide (300 g., 4.11 moles) is added, with stirring, over a 15-minute period, while cooling with ice to an internal temperature of 15–20°. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 minutes and then poured onto ca. 800 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, the resulting layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted once with 100 ml. of dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined and extracted six times with 100-ml. portions of water to remove most of the N,N-dimethylformamide. The resulting organic solution is dried for 2 hours with 50 g. of potassium carbonate, decanted from the drying agent, and concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The resulting oil is distilled through a 10-cm. Vigreux column to give 197–225 g. (78–87%) of cinnamonitrile, b.p. 92–94° (1 mm.), n25D 1.5998. Its 1H NMR spectrum (60 MHz., CCl4, 36°) δ, (multiplicity, coupling constant J in Hz., number of protons): 5.79 (d, J = 17, 1H), 7.29 (d, J = 17, 1H), 7.35 (s, 5H).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and an inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask and drawn out to a small opening, are placed 600 cc. of dry carbon tetrachloride, 154 g. (0.5 mole) of di-o-nitrophenyl disulfide, m.p. 193–195° (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 220), and 0.25 g. of iodine. To the upper end of the condenser is attached a glass tube which dips below the surface of a little carbon tetrachloride contained in a test tube. A current of chlorine, dried with sulfuric acid, is passed into the reaction mixture, the temperature of which is maintained at 50–60°. The rate of flow of the chlorine (about 16–17 g. per hour) is regulated so that little or no gas escapes through the carbon tetrachloride trap. The yellow di-o-nitrophenyl disulfide gradually disappears, and after two to two and one-half hours a homogeneous, dark yellow solution is obtained. The warm solution is filtered from a small amount of dark residue through a warm Büchner funnel, the flask and filter being rinsed with 30 cc. of warm carbon tetrachloride. The yellow filtrate is cooled to 5° and the product allowed to crystallize. The cake of crystals is broken with a rod, collected on a Büchner funnel, and drained well. The product is dried rapidly (two hours) at 50° and bottled. This material melts at 73–74.5° and weighs 126–135 g. (66–71 per cent of the theoretical amount). A further crop is obtained by removing the solvent from the mother liquor by distillation from a water bath, the dark, residual oil being poured into an evaporating dish. The last traces of carbon tetrachloride are removed by drying at 50°, during which process the oil crystallizes. This material melts at 67–72° and weighs 48–58 g. It is pure enough for most purposes. The total yield is 183–184 g. (96–97 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
To a mixture of 212 g. (1 mole) of benzoin, 200 cc. of glacial acetic acid, and 200 cc. (2.1 moles) of acetic anhydride, in a 1-l. beaker provided with a mechanical stirrer, is added slowly, with stirring, 20 cc. of concentrated c.p. sulfuric acid. This requires five minutes, during which the benzoin quickly dissolves and the temperature rises to about 50°. The beaker is placed on the steam bath for twenty minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool somewhat, transferred to a large dropping funnel, and added slowly to 2.5 l. of water vigorously stirred in a 4-l. (1-gal.) crock during thirty minutes. Stirring is continued for one hour. The mixture is filtered by suction on a 30-cm. Büchner funnel, and the crystals are sucked as dry as possible and spread on filter paper. After about two hours the crystals are transferred to a 1-l. beaker and warmed to about 60° with 400 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The clear solution is cooled with stirring to 5° and filtered by suction. The air-dried benzoin acetate, melting at 80–82°, weighs 220–230 g. (86 to 90 per cent of the theoretical amount). Another crystallization from 400 cc. of alcohol removes the slight yellow tinge and gives a product melting at 81.5–82.5°, with a loss of about 10 g.
B. (−)-(1S,4R)-Camphanic acid. A 2000-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser is charged with 1000-mL of 0.1 N sulfuric acid and heated by means of an oil bath to 80°C. Finely powdered (−)-(1R,3R)-3-chlorocamphoric anhydride (115 g, 0.53 mol) is added in portions over about 10 min to the stirred acid solution, the necks are sealed with glass stoppers and the resulting suspension is brought to a gentle reflux. After all the solids have dissolved (4–6 hr), the resulting solution is refluxed for an additional 2 hr. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring overnight (~12 hr), and the resulting off-while solid is collected by vacuum filtration and washed with water (3 × 250 mL). The remaining camphanic acid is obtained by extraction of the aqueous filtrate with three 250-mL portions of chloroform. After evaporation of the combined organic phases, the combined vacuum-dried solids are added to a 1000-mL, round-bottomed flask containing 500 mL of toluene, a condenser is added and the mixture is brought to gentle reflux until dissolution is complete. The water/toluene azeotrope (85°C) is removed by distillation until no further water is obtained. Distillation of the toluene (110°C) is then continued until the residual volume has been reduced to ~350 mL and. The resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature during which time the acid crystallizes. After 4 hr at room temperature, the solids are collected by vacuum filtration and air-dried, affording (−)-(1S,4R)-camphanic acid (76 g, 72%) as colorless needles, mp 197–201°C, of sufficient purity for use in the next step and.
In the similarly equipped 5-l. three-necked flask B are placed 1.5 l. of liquid ammonia and 440 g. (4.25 moles) of γ-chlorobutyronitrile [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 156 (1941)]. The flasks are connected by means of the 12-mm. glass tube D reaching to the bottom of the sodamide flask A and extending 1 cm. through the rubber stopper in one neck of flask B. Vigorous stirring is maintained in both flasks while the sodamide suspension is slowly forced over into the reaction flask in small portions (Caution!) by means of air pressure applied through C; the rate of addition is controlled by placing the finger over the by-pass in the T-tube. At first the reaction is violent, and only small amounts of the sodamide solution should be added. The addition is continued at such a rate that the total time required for addition of all the sodamide solution is 1–1.5 hours. The sodamide flask is rinsed with 300 ml. of liquid ammonia, and the washings are added to the reaction mixture, after which stirring is continued for 2 hours. During the second hour, addition of Dry Ice to the reflux condenser is discontinued, and the ammonia is permitted to evaporate slowly. At the end of the 2-hour stirring period, the inlet tube is replaced by a dropping funnel and 1 l. of dry ether is slowly added. The reaction mixture is quickly filtered through a sintered-glass funnel, and the filter cake is washed with two 200-ml. portions of dry ether. The ammonia and ether are removed by distillation on a water bath through a packed column. The residue is then distilled through the column under the pressure of a water pump. The yield of cyclopropyl cyanide boiling at 69–70°/80 mm. (75–76°/95 mm.) is 149–152 g. (52–53% based upon γ-chlorobutyronitrile) and. The pressure is then reduced, and the unchanged γ-chlorobutyronitrile is collected at 93–96°/26 mm. It amounts to 52–62 g.
The creamy suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the electrodes of a pH meter are inserted. A solution of 20.5 g. (0.15 mole) of zinc chloride in 75 ml. of water is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a period of 45 minutes, while the pH is maintained at 7 by the simultaneous dropwise addition of a 4N aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred for 1 hour and is then filtered with suction; the solid product is dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide. The dry material is slurried with 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°), and the solvent is decanted. This process is repeated five times, and the combined extract is evaporated at reduced pressure. The yield of almost pure p-chlorophenyl isothiocyanate, obtained as a readily crystallizing oil with a pleasant anise-like odor, is 33–35 g. (65–68%), m.p. 44–45°. The product can be recrystallized from the minimum amount of ethanol at 50°.
Unless the aldehyde is to be used immediately, it is stored in a brown bottle at 0° after the addition of 0.1 g. of hydroquinone and a blanket of nitrogen.
A. Ethyl 3-methylcoumarilate. Dry sodium phenolate (116 g., 1 mole) and 1 l. of dry thiophene-free benzene are placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser with drying tube. The suspension is heated to the boiling point on the steam bath, heating is moderated, and 165 g. (1 mole) of ethyl α-chloroacetoacetate is added with stirring through the dropping funnel at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. Refluxing and stirring are continued on the steam bath for 4 hours after the addition of the chloroester has been completed. The light brown suspension is cooled to room temperature, extracted with two 500-ml. portions of water, and dried superficially by filtration through a layer of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation on the steam bath under water-aspirator vacuum. The brown oil remaining consists of crude ethyl α-phenoxyacetoacetate and weighs 188–200 g. (85–90%).
The solution is then cooled in an ice bath and acidified by 200 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) previously mixed with 300 g. of cracked ice. The solution is again cooled in an ice bath. The thick floating layer of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid and various polymers is separated and the cold aqueous solution extracted once with 1 l. of ether, using a stirrer instead of shaking. The extract and crude acid are combined and dried over 50 g. of Drierite, and the solvent is removed in a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask on a steam bath. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of acid boiling at 94–95°/26 mm. or 117–118°/75 mm. is 63.5–68 g. (74–79%).
B. 3-Cyclopentene-1-carboxylic acid . A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 35.8 g of 3-cyclopentene-1,1-dicarboxylic acid and then fitted with a reflux condenser capped with a rubber septum and connected to a Nujol-filled bubbler by means of a syringe needle. The contents of the flask are heated in an oil bath at 170-175°C until carbon dioxide evolution is complete (ca. 2 hr) and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting oil is transferred to a 50-mL flask and vacuum distilled without fractionation to provide 23.0 g (89% or 82% overall from dimethyl malonate) of 3-cyclopentene-1-carboxylic acid as a clear, colorless oil, bp 88°C (2 mm).
(B) Isatin.—Six hundred grams (326 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is warmed to 50° in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, and, to this, 75 g. (0.46 mole) of dry isonitrosoacetanilide is added at such a rate as to keep the temperature between 60° and 70° but not higher. External cooling should be applied at this stage so that the reaction can be carried out more rapidly. After the addition of the isonitroso compound is finished, the solution is heated to 80° and kept at this temperature for about ten minutes to complete the reaction. Then the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured upon ten to twelve times its volume of cracked ice. After standing for about one-half hour, the isatin is filtered with suction, washed several times with cold water to remove the sulfuric acid, and then dried in the air. The yield of crude isatin, which melts at 189–192°, is 47–52 g. (71–78 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is pure enough for many purposes.
E. (1'S,5'R)-Spiro[1,3-dioxolane-2,3'-[6]oxabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan]-7'-one ( 5 ). N-Methyl-2-chloropyridinium trifluoromethane sulfonate (3) (33.2 g, 120 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is weighed out in a one-necked, oven-dried 1000-mL round-bottomed flask. A 4-cm stir bar is added, and the flask is purged with nitrogen and then charged with dry acetonitrile (240 mL). A solution of the catalyst, O-TMS QND (4) (3.16 g, 7.97 mmol, 0.1 equiv) dissolved in dry acetonitrile (100 mL) at 23 °C is transferred to the reaction flask via cannula with nitrogen pressure, which is followed by addition of freshly distilled diisopropylethylamine (Hünig's base) via syringe (35.4 mL, 199 mmol, 2.5 equiv). The reaction mixture is stirred for 10 min, and then a solution of 3-(2-(2-oxoethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-2-yl) propanoic acid (2) (15.0 g, 79.7 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry CH3CN (60 mL) is added via syringe pump over ~1 h (30 mL syringe, ~1 mL/min, syringe is loaded twice). The reaction mixture changes from yellow to a dark red color during this addition. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 18 h at ambient temperature, and the reaction progress is monitored by the disappearance of aldehyde acid 2 and the formation of β-lactone 5 by TLC analysis (R f 0.29 and 0.52, respectively in 60% EtOAc/hexanes, KMnO4 stain). When the reaction is judged complete, the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation and then by high vacuum (0.5 mmHg, 30 °C) for 3 h to provide a dark brown, viscous oil (~ 75 g). The oil is diluted with 25 mL of CH2Cl2 and loaded onto a silica gel plug (188 g, 2.5 g silica gel per gram of crude product, 10-cm diameter flash column) pre-eluted with 50% EtOAc:hexanes, using a long stem funnel to carefully deliver the crude mixture onto the silica gel surface (washing with 5 mL of CH2Cl2 and then 10 mL of 50% EtOAc:hexanes). The product is quickly eluted with 50% EtOAc:hexanes (2000 mL). Forty fractions (~45 mL in 50 mL test tubes) are collected and fractions 7-35 containing the majority of the β-lactone (R f = 0.52 (60% EtOAc:hexanes; KMnO4)) are combined and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 °C) and then under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg at 23 °C) to deliver 8.3 g of semi-crude β-lactone. Recrystallization from EtOAc:hexanes gives a total of 4.5 g (33%) of bicyclic-β-lactone. Enantiomeric excess was determined to be 90% ee by chiral HPLC analysis.
The mixture is cooled to 25°, and the crystalline 2-mercapto-4-amino-5-carbethoxypyrimidine is collected on a 10-cm. Büchner funnel and washed successively with five 50-ml. portions of water, 50 ml. of acetone, and 50 ml. of ether. The carbethoxypyrimidine weighs 152–159 g. (76–80%) and melts with decomposition at 259–260° after being dried for 5 hours at 110° and atmospheric pressure. It is in the form of a cream-colored powder that is sufficiently pure for synthetic purposes. Pure carbethoxypyrimidine can be obtained by recrystallizing the crude product once from 50% acetic acid, using 170 ml. per gram of pyrimidine.
If pure biacetyl monoxime is desired, the crude product is neutralized with about 35 cc. of concentrated aqueous ammonia and diluted with half its volume of water. It is then distilled to remove alcohol, etc., until the distillate is no longer inflammable. The receiver is changed, and the contents are now rapidly distilled, using superheated steam. Almost all the biacetyl monoxime comes over in the first 5 l. of distillate. One to 1.5 kg. of salt is dissolved in the distillate, which is then cooled to 0°. The solid biacetyl monoxime crystallizes and may be filtered. The yield is 480–520 g. The product can be further purified, if desired, by recrystallizing from water.
The bulk of the brown-colored benzene solution is decanted into a cold mixture of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1.5 l. of water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The remainder is filtered on a Büchner funnel, and the lumps of aluminum chloride are washed with two 100-cc. portions of benzene. The filtrates are added to the main solution and the whole is washed thoroughly with the dilute acid. If the layers do not separate readily the mixture is filtered with gentle suction and the water separated by siphoning. The solution is washed twice with 1.5-l. portions of water and filtered again if necessary.
A 100-ml., Claisen distillation flask with two 14/20 standard taper joints and a thermometer-inlet is equipped with a gas-inlet adapter, a receiver, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar. A 40-ml. calibration mark is made on the flask, and 970 mg. (2.50 mmoles) of cholest-4-en-3β-ol is introduced. Triethyl orthoacetate is then distilled under argon into the flask to the 40-ml. mark. The mixture is stirred, effecting solution while the flask is purged with argon, then the top joint is sealed with a thermometer. The stirred solution is heated under a positive pressure of argon so that the vapor reflux level is just below the side arm of the flask; the temperature on the lower thermometer is 142–147°; the upper thermometer temperature is kept between 25 and 70°. After 8 days of reflux, during which time a small amount of the volatile material distills into the receiver, the reaction flask is cooled, and all the volatile materials are removed at reduced pressure. The residue (1.3 g. of a pale yellow oil) is chromatographed on 120 g. of silica gel with 10% diethyl ether in petroleum ether as the eluant. The side products eluted with the first 240 ml. of the solvent are discarded; further elution with 120 ml. of the solvent affords 690 mg. of ethyl 5β-cholest-3-ene-5-acetate as a clear, colorless oil. Trituration of this product with acetone produces 560–690 mg. (49–60%) of the ester as white plates, m.p. 89–92.5°.
C. (R,R)-Dibenzofuran-4,6-dicarboxylic acid bis(2-hydroxy-1-phenylethyl) amide (4): A 250-mL, three-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirbar, is charged with 5.00 g (17.07 mmol) of diacid chloride 3 and 135 mL of freshly distilled CHCl3. After cooling the suspension to 0°C under nitrogen, a solution of 5.18 g (37.74 mmol) of (R)-phenylglycinol and 5.26 mL (37.74 mmol) of triethylamine (Et3N) in 25 mL of CHCl3 is added over 2 hr via an addition funnel. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 hr at 25°C, CHCl3 (100 mL) and solid ammonium chloride (5 g) is added and the suspension is stirred for a further 0.5 hr. The suspension is filtered and the residue is washed with CHCl3 (3 × 50 mL). The residue is put aside for suspension in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The resulting residue is purified by two recrystallizations from ethyl acetate/hexane (ca. 9:1) to give the amide 4 (combined yield 5.2 g, 61.0%). The mother liquor from the recrystallizations is chromatographed using silica gel (eluting with ethyl acetate/hexanes initially in a 1:1 ratio and increasing to 4:1, then 1:0) to give more amide 4 (0.6 g, 7.0%). The original solid residue, obtained from the filtration, is suspended in THF (200 mL); the slurry is stirred using a magnetic stirbar for 30 min. The product is filtered. The THF extraction of this residue is repeated and the filtrates are combined. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure afforded additional amide 4, which was recrystallized as before (1.7 g, 20.0%). The overall yield of amide 4 is 5.9-7.5 g (11.9-14.9 mmol, 70-88%).
The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, when the ethyl propane-1,1,2,3-tetracarboxylate comes over at 182–184°/8 mm. The yield is 1261–1273 g. (93–94 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In the distillate the ketone layer is separated from the water, and the latter is distilled until one-third has been collected. The ketone layer in this distillate is separated, and the water layer is again distilled. This procedure is repeated as long as any considerable amount of ketone is obtained in the distillate. The combined ketone fraction is washed four times with one-third its volume of a concentrated solution of calcium chloride (sp. gr. 1.3 or greater) to remove alcohol, then dried over 50 g. of solid calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled. The yield of methyl n-amyl ketone boiling at 148–151°/750 mm. is 300–350 g. (52–61 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the original ethyl acetoacetate).
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and an inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom, is placed 141 g. (1 mole) of freshly distilled o-chlorobenzaldehyde. To the upper end of the condenser is attached a tube leading to a flask containing water for the absorption of hydrogen chloride. The reaction vessel and absorption flask are weighed accurately, and a current of chlorine, dried by sulfuric acid, is passed into the aldehyde, the temperature of which is maintained at 140–160°. The rate of the current of gas is so regulated that little or no chlorine escapes. The reaction and absorption flasks are removed and weighed about every three hours. After about fifteen hours the absorption of chlorine at 160° practically ceases.
B. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (2). To 119–128 g (0.33–0.36 mol) of crude pyrylium salt in a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer is added 2 L of 95% ethanol. The mixture is cooled to −60°C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath and to the fine slurry is added, with stirring, in one portion 1 L of concentrated (d 0.90) ammonium hydroxide also cooled to −60°C. The yellow reaction mixture is held at −60°C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to −40°C and maintained at that temperature for 2 hr, during which time the slurry dissolves. The mixture is then allowed to spontaneously warm to room temperature. The reaction mixture is divided into two portions. Each portion is poured into a 4-L separatory funnel, 1 L of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide is added, and the mixture is extracted with four 250-mL portions of pentane. The extracts from both portions are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator, leaving a residual light-yellow oil that is dissolved in 150 mL of pentane and introduced slowly during 20–30 min onto the top of a 40 × 4.5 cm water-jacketed chromatography column containing 300 g of activated alumina. After the solution has been added, the column is filled with pentane and a 1-L constant-pressure addition funnel, also filled with pentane, is fitted to the top of the column to provide a slight head pressure. The elution is completed in ca. 90 min. All the pyridine is obtained in the first 2 L of eluant. The pentane is removed on the rotary evaporator to yield 62.7–66.3 g (90–93%) of a colorless, odorless oil that solidifies on cooling or standing, mp 31–32°C.
1-Bromo-2-fluoro-2-phenylpropane. A magnetically stirred mixture of α-methylstyrene (7.1 g, 60 mmol), triethylamine trihydrofluoride and (14.7 mL, 90 mmol) and dichloromethane (60 mL) contained in a 250 mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is treated with N-bromosuccinimide (11.8 g, 66 mmol) at 0°C. After 15 min, the bath is removed, and stirring is continued at room temperature for 5 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into ice water (1000 mL), made slightly basic with aqueous 28% ammonia, and extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 150 mL). The combined extracts are washed with 0.1 N hydrochloric acid (2 × 150 mL) and 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (2 × 150 mL) and then dried over magnesium sulfate . After removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation, the crude product is distilled to give the product: 11.6 g (89%); bp 50-52°C (0.15 mm), n20 D 1.5370.
Into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser are introduced 165 g. (5 moles) of 91% paraformaldehyde and 1250 g. (24 moles) of 88% formic acid. The mixture is heated to 80° with stirring and is stirred until the paraformaldehyde has dissolved. To the stirred mixture is rapidly added 1.8 kg. (15 moles) of mesitylene and the whole heated under reflux for 6 hours.
The crude enamine is dissolved in 450 ml. of ether, and the solution is transferred to a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer, a 250-ml. dropping funnel, and a two-necked adapter fitted with a calcium chloride tube and a thermometer immersed in the solution. A solution of 71–76 g. (0.85–0.90 mole) of methyl propiolate (Caution! Methyl propiolate is a severe lachrymator and should be handled only in the hood.) in 150 ml. of ether is added dropwise. During the addition the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 25–30° by periodic cooling of the reaction flask in a dry ice-acetone bath. When the addition is almost complete, a white solid begins to separate. The mixture is stirred at 25–30° for an additional hour, cooled to 0°, and filtered to remove the solid. This is dissolved in 700 ml. of 6% hydrochloric acid, the acidic solution is warmed at 55–60° for 1 hour, and the mixture is cooled and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residue of crude methyl 10-oxocyclodec-2-ene-1-carboxylate is dissolved in 300 ml. of methanol and hydrogenated over 5 g. of 5% palladium-on-alumina catalyst at 40 p.s.i. pressure and room temperature.
B. 2-Methyl-4'-nitrobiphenyl. To a mixture of 1.16 g (1 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 20.2 g (100 mmol) of 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene in a 500-mL flask, set up as described above and immersed in a water bath, is added the o-tolylzinc chloride solution prepared above. The reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hr at room temperature and poured onto a mixture of 100 mL of ether and 300 mL of ice-cold 3 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator to give a light-brown solid. The solid is recrystallized from 300 mL of hexane to yield 16.0 g of yellow crystals. The second crop from 50 mL of hexane is 2.4 g. The combined product is recrystallized from 100 mL of ethanol to afford 16.0 g of light-yellow needles. Crystallization of the mother liquor from 25 mL of ethanol gives a second crop of 0.5 g. The total yield of 2-methyl-4'-nitrobiphenyl is 16.5 g (78% based on 1-bromo-4-nitrobenzene).
A. (2R,3S)- and (2S,3S)-1,4-Dioxa-2,3-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-8-carboethoxy-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane. An oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, 100-mL addition funnel, and rubber septum, and then is charged with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and 7.7 mL (10.5 g, 86.7 mmol) of 2-bromopropene. The solution is cooled to −70°C with mechanical stirring and a 1.9 M pentane solution of tert-butyllithium (92 mL, 175 mmol) is added by syringe over 20 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for an additional 10 min at −70°C and at this time a solution of 17.6 g (54.0 mmol) of 3-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]-2-butanone2 and 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added by dropping funnel over 20 min. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 30 min at −70°C and at this time a 1.0 M tetrahydrofuran solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride (163 mL, 163 mmol) is added in one portion and the resulting mixture is warmed to 23°C and stirred for 1 hr. At this time the contents of the flask are poured into 200 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and the resulting mixture is concentrated to remove tetrahydrofuran. The resulting aqueous suspension is diluted with 200 mL of brine and extracted twice with 200 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined organic extracts are washed with five 100-mL portions of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residue is subjected to short path vacuum distillation (150–160°C, 3 mm) to remove the less volatile tert-butyldiphenylsilyl by-product. The distillate contains ca. 10 g of a colorless oil that is comprised of the 2,3-dimethyl-1-pentene-3,4-diols as a 6:1 mixture of diastereomers and up to 30% of tributylamine and.
A large sintered-glass funnel (9-cm diameter, porosity grade 2) is partially filled with Celite (Celite height: 2.5 cm) and then impregnated with methylene chloride. The suspension resulting from hydrolysis is poured in portions onto the Celite under suction by a water pump. The Celite is washed many times with 50-mL portions of technical-grade methylene chloride. In order to accelerate filtration and to improve washing, the surface of the Celite is disturbed from time to time with a spatula. The filtration time is approximately 50 min. The filtrate (300 mL) is then vigorously stirred for 1 hr in a mixture of 80 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide and 40 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic phase [negative test for peroxides using a Merck kit (Merkoquant 1001 l)] is decanted, dried (magnesium sulfate or sodium sulfate), filtered and concentrated in a Büchi apparatus (bath temperature: 45°C) to leave 10 g of an oily material that is a mixture of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide, 2-phenyl-2-propanol, and some starting sulfide.
The residue, a thick brown oil, which is crude γ-di-n-butylaminopropylamine dihydrochloride, is treated with a solution of 80 g. of potassium hydroxide in 80 ml. of water. A brown oil separates above the aqueous layer, which contains a considerable amount of solid potassium chloride. The whole is extracted with one 200-ml. portion and two 50-ml. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are then placed in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask over 50 g. of potassium hydroxide and allowed to dry overnight.
The product is allowed to settle and the hot supernatant liquid is poured through a preheated suction filter. The filtrate deposits less than 10 g. of crude product on cooling. The product in the flask is shaken with several 100-cc. portions of water, and all the fine material is transferred to the filter. Some lumpy material is usually left in the flask. This is transferred to a large mortar and ground to a paste with a little water and then transferred to the filter. After sucking as dry as possible, the suction is shut off, and 100 cc. of alcohol is poured over the material on the filter. After standing a few minutes, suction is again applied. The product is then dried to constant weight. The yield of anhydro-2-hydroxymercuri-3-nitrobenzoic acid is 300–330 g. (82–90 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the 3-nitrophthalic acid used). It is a cream-colored powder which dissolves in an excess of dilute sodium hydroxide, leaving only a slight turbidity and.
The nitrosomethylurea rises to the surface as a crystalline foamy precipitate which is filtered at once with suction and pressed well on the filter. The crystals are stirred to a paste with about 50 cc. of cold water, sucked as dry as possible, and dried in a vacuum desiccator to constant weight. The yield is 105–115 g. (66–72 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and set up for a simple vacuum distillation are placed 500 ml. of triethylene glycol dimethyl ether and 300 ml. of isopropyl alcohol. Mechanical stirring is started, and 53.5 g. (2.23 moles) of sodium hydride in a mineral oil suspension is added in small portions. After the addition is complete, the remaining neck of the flask is fitted with a Y-tube to which is connected a two-holed rubber stopper containing a thermometer which reaches into the flask below the liquid level and a piece of glass tubing which is connected to a nitrogen tank. A pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 242 g. (1.00 mole) of 1,2-dibromocyclohexane is placed in the other arm of the Y-tube.
After four or five days, with daily shakings, most of the casein is in solution and chalky masses of tyrosine begin to separate. After five days, a second 20-g. portion of pancreatin in 100 cc. of water is added. After twelve days, the bottle is cooled in an icebox overnight and the undissolved material is filtered and reserved for the preparation of tyrosine.
C. (1S,2S)-trans-1-Benzoyloxy-2-bromocyclohexane (4). A 100-mL, two-necked flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a septum cap is charged with 1 g of molecular sieves 4 Å, and flame-dried under reduced pressure. After being allowed to warm to ambient temperature, the apparatus is flushed with argon. The flask is charged with (S)-1-methyl-2-[(dihydroisoindol-2-yl)methyl]pyrrolidine (65 mg, 0.28 mmol) in dichloromethane (5 mL), triethylamine (5.56 g, 55 mmol) in dichloromethane (15 mL), and racemic trans-2-bromocyclohexanol (17.91 g, 100 mmol) in dichloromethane (40 mL) by means of an oven-dried syringe and needle. After cooling to −78 °C by immersion in a dry-ice bath, benzoyl chloride (9.14 g, 65 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) is added slowly over 30 min by means of an oven-dried syringe and needle. The solution is stirred for 3 h at −78 °C, and then quenched with a phosphate buffer (pH 7). The layers are separated and the aqueous layer extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phase is washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum. The crude products are purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexanes:1/50) to give (1S, 2S)-trans-1-benzoyloxy-2-bromocyclohexane (14.25 g, 50%) and unreacted alcohol (1R, 2R)-trans-2-bromocyclohexanol (6.60 g, 37%).
The slurry is stirred with tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) at room temperature for 5 min and ammonium salts are removed by suction filtration through a Büchner funnel. After the solids are rinsed with tetrahydrofuran (20 mL), the filtrate is passed through a plug of silica gel (65 g Merck 60 230-400 mesh) in a coarse porosity sintered-glass filter funnel with aspirator suction. The funnel is further washed with acetonitrile (750 mL) and the combined filtrates are evaporated (rotary evaporator) to give a white solid. This material is recrystallized by heating (steam bath) with 8 : 1 ether : ethanol (70 mL); if necessary, ethanol is added dropwise to obtain a homogeneous solution. Cooling to room temperature results in white flakes that are collected by filtration (ether wash), 2.93 g. Two more crops (1.3 g total) are obtained by repeating the process for a total of 4.23 g (71%), mp 152–153°C (lit.2 155°C). In several similar runs, the yield of amide was 4.23–4.49 g (71–76%).
The product is digested under reflux for about 20 minutes with 100–150 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol. The suspension is cooled quickly almost to room temperature and filtered rapidly with suction to remove any anthracene. The 9-acetylanthracene, which separates in the filtrate, is redissolved by heating and allowed to crystallize by slowly cooling the solution (finally to 0–5° in an icebox). A second recrystallization from 95% ethanol yields 35–37 g. (57–60%) of light-tan granules of 9-acetylanthracene melting at 75–76°.
The reaction mixture is then transferred to a 2-l. wide-necked, round-bottomed flask; 300 g. of cracked ice is added all at once; and the mixture is rapidly agitated until the decomposition is complete. Twice the theoretical amount of 30 per cent sulfuric acid is added to dissolve the magnesium hydroxide, and the mixture is then steam-distilled until no more oil is collected. The distillate, which amounts to 1500–2500 cc., is saturated with sodium chloride and the ether-alcohol layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether and the ether extract added to the ether-alcohol layer. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and heated carefully on a steam cone until all the ether is distilled. The crude alcohol is warmed one-half hour with 5 g. of freshly dehydrated lime. After filtering and washing the lime with a little ether, the ether is distilled, and then the residual alcohol distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The carbinol distils at 88–93°/18 mm. (practically all distilling at 91°). The yield is 72.5–78.5 g. (64–69 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, surmounted by a packed fractionating column, is placed a mixture of 354 g. (3 moles) of pinacol and 10 ml. of commercial 48% hydrobromic acid. A few boiling chips are added, and the flask is then heated slowly with a colorless flame about 3 in. high. The distillate is collected until the thermometer reads 95°; this requires about 2 hours when the rate of distillation is approximately 20–30 drops per minute. The upper, non-aqueous layer is washed twice with 100-ml. portions of water, 0.5 g. of hydroquinone is added, and the liquid is dried overnight with 15 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. It is then fractionated as below, using the same column but a 1-l. flask.
A. 2-Chlorocyclooctanone oxime hydrochloride. In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a tube fitted with a thermometer and a calcium chloride tube, is placed 55 g. (0.50 mole) of freshly distilled cyclooctene and 600 ml. of trichloroethylene. The solution is cooled with ice water to 5°, and 36 g. (0.55 mole) of nitrosyl chloride and excess of hydrogen chloride gas (about 400–600 ml. per minute) are bubbled into the solution, keeping the reaction temperature between 5–10°. The solution gradually becomes light reddish brown. The addition of nitrosyl chloride should be carried out in about 1.5 hours. After completion of the addition of nitrosyl chloride, hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled in for another 15 minutes. A light brown oily material is obtained after evaporation of the solvent under an aspirator pressure below 35° by using an efficient rotatory evaporator. On cooling this product in a refrigerator, 107.2 g. (ca. 100%) of crude 2-chlorocyclooctanone oxime hydrochloride is obtained as a solid.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a stirrer, thermometer for reading low temperatures, and a dropping funnel, and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, is placed a solution of 130 g. (2.0 moles) of potassium cyanide in 250 ml. of water. With stirring, a solution of 170 ml. (2.0 moles) of commercial 37% formaldehyde solution1 and 130 ml. of water is admitted slowly from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 10° (about 40 minutes is required). After 10 minutes' standing, 230 ml. of dilute sulfuric acid (57 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, sp. gr. 1.84, in 173 ml. of water) is added with stirring, the same low temperature being maintained. A copious precipitate of potassium sulfate is formed. The pH of the solution is then about 1.9. A 5% potassium hydroxide solution is then added, dropwise, and with cooling, until the pH is about 3.0 (determined either by means of a pH meter or tropaeolin 00 paper); about 4 ml. of the solution is required. The flask is then removed from the cooling bath, 30 ml. of ether is added, and the mixture is well shaken. The salt is removed by filtration, using a 14-cm. Büchner funnel, and washed with 30 ml. of ether. The filtrate is poured into a 1-l. continuous ether extractor2 and extracted for 48 hours with 300 ml. of ether. The ether extract is dried for 3–4 hours over 15 g. of anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite) and filtered. Ten milliliters of absolute ethanol is added to the filtrate, and the ether is removed on a steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure using a flask having a Vigreux side arm. After a small (2–3 ml.) fore-run, the glycolonitrile distils smoothly at 86–88°/8 mm. (102–104°/16 mm.). The yield of pure glycolonitrile amounts to 86.5–91 g. (76–80%).
The warm residue is then diluted with water to a volume of 500–550 cc. and placed in a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-cc. dropping funnel, a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a condenser arranged for distillation. The lower end of the condenser is fitted to a receiver consisting of a 500-cc. suction flask, whose side arm is connected to a reflux condenser. The receiver is placed in an ice-salt bath and the three-necked flask in a water bath. The temperature of the water bath is raised to 95–98°, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 400 g. (7.1 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 250 cc. of water is added dropwise from the funnel. As soon as the free hydrochloric acid is neutralized, the amine begins to distil. The rate of the addition of the alkali is regulated so as to maintain a dropwise distillation of allylamine and, after the addition is complete, heating and stirring are continued until all the amine has distilled.
A 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, and a dry ice condenser protected from the air by a soda-lime drying tube. The system is flushed thoroughly with dry ammonia, and 32.8 g. (0.84 mole) of sodium amide is added to the flask. The system is again flushed with ammonia, the condenser is provided with dry ice covered by acetone, and 1.2 l. of liquid ammonia is condensed in the flask. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a dropping funnel, the stirrer is started, and 118 g. (0.72 mole) of N-(2-bromoallyl)ethylamine2 is added dropwise in 20–30 minutes; during the addition, the ammonia boils vigorously, and the color of the slurry changes from gray to black. Stirring is continued for 3 hours, and the dry ice is then allowed to evaporate. The condenser is provided with an ice-salt mixture, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate until the volume is reduced to about 800 ml.. Ethanol-free ether (200 ml.) is added rapidly through the dropping funnel, and the reaction is stopped by the slow, dropwise addition (Caution!) of 5 ml. of water. The ammonia is allowed to evaporate overnight. Water (150 ml.) and 100 ml. of ether are added to the residue, and the mixture is stirred for 2 minutes in order to dissolve the precipitated salts. The resulting mixture, which consists of aqueous and ethereal solutions, is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 75 ml. of ether. The ether solutions are combined, dried over sodium hydroxide, and distilled through an efficient low-holdup column. The fraction with b.p. 77–80°, n25D 1.4260–1.4268, which is 96–97% N-ethylallenimine, weighs 30–34 g. (48–55%). Pure (>99.5%) N-ethylallenimine has b.p. 77–79°, n25D 1.4281–1.4284 and.
D. Hydrazinolysis of styrene glycol dimesylate. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 50 ml. (1 mole) of hydrazine hydrate. Finely powdered styrene glycol dimesylate (20 g., 0.068 mole), m.p. 93–94°, is then added with gentle stirring at room temperature. To the resulting slurry is slowly added 600 ml. of pentane. The stirring speed should be adjusted in such a manner that the two phases mix somewhat, but the dimesylate–hydrazine hydrate layer is not deposited on the upper walls of the flask. After 20–24 hours of stirring at room temperature two entirely clear layers can be observed upon the cessation of stirring, indicating that the reaction is complete. The hydrazine hydrate is separated from the pentane and extracted with two 30-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane layers are filtered through cotton, which holds back any remaining droplets of hydrazine hydrate, into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask. At this point Step E is followed for 1-amino-2-phenylaziridine, and Step F for 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 15.0 g. (0.100 mole) of adamantanone (Tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan-2-one),, 25.4 g. (0.130 mole) of p-tolylsulfonylmethyl isocyanide,, 10 ml. (0.17 mole) of absolute ethanol, and 350 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane. The stirred solution is cooled in an ice bath to 5°, and 28 g. (0.25 mole) of potassium tert-butoxide is added in portions at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 5° and 10°(Note 7). After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is heated for 30 minutes at 35–40°, the stirred suspension is cooled to room temperature, and the precipitated potassium p-toluenesulfinate is removed by filtration. The precipitate is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and the combined 1,2-dimethoxyethane solutions are concentrated to a volume of 25–35 ml. on a rotary evaporator. The concentrated solution is chromatographed through a short column of alumina using distilled petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°) as the eluent. The combined fractions are refluxed for 15 minutes with 1 g. of activated carbon. After removal of the carbon, the solution is concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. The white solid residue is dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel, yielding 13.5–14.5 g. (84–90%) of analytically pure 2-adamantanecarbonitrile, m.p. 170–177°.
The solid is then filtered off, washed first with water, then with 400 cc. of 10 per cent acetic acid (to remove the dimethylaniline), and finally with distilled water. The last filtrate is generally pale pink. The solid is sucked as dry as possible, spread out on a tray in order to allow most of the water to evaporate (fifteen to twenty hours), and then suspended in 4 l. of methyl alcohol in a 12-l. flask. This mixture is stirred on the steam bath under a reflux condenser for one to two hours, allowed to cool slowly, and then chilled in an ice bath and filtered. The solid product is washed with a second 4 l. of cold methyl alcohol. After being dried in air, it varies in weight from 820 to 870 g.
During the shaking 350 ml. of glacial acetic acid is heated to boiling in a 600-ml. beaker under a hood, and 5 ml. of a saturated sodium chloride solution and 4 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added. The flame is extinguished, and the filtered hemin solution poured in a steady stream with stirring into the hot mixture; the suction flask is rinsed with 15 ml. of chloroform. After the mixture has stood for 12 hours, the crystals are filtered with suction on a small Büchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of 50% aqueous acetic acid, 100 ml. of distilled water, 25 ml. of ethanol, and 25 ml. of ether. Suction is continued until the crystals are dry, when they can be readily removed. The recovery is 75–85%.
A solution of 28.8 g. (0.08 mole) of 3β-acetoxy-5-pregnen-20-one (pregnenolone acetate) in 1.1 l. of dioxane is diluted with 320 ml. of water and placed in a 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer. The stirrer is started and the mixture is cooled in ice. When the internal temperature has fallen to 8°, the cold hypobromite solution is added in a steady stream. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained below 10° throughout the reaction. A white precipitate begins to form after 10 minutes, and the solution becomes colorless during 1 hour. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours, and then the excess sodium hypobromite is destroyed by the addition of a solution of 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfite in 100 l. of water.
(A) Phosphorus Pentachloride Method.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask is placed a mixture of 250 g. (1.2 moles) of finely divided phosphorus pentachloride and 450 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium benzenesulfonate which has previously been dried for three hours at 140°. The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 170–180° for fifteen hours. It is advisable to have a reflux condenser attached to the flask, although very little active refluxing takes place. Every four hours during the heating period, the flask should be removed from the oil bath, cooled for fifteen minutes, stoppered and shaken thoroughly until the mass becomes pasty (sometimes ten to fifteen minutes are required to accomplish this). At the end of the heating period, the mixture is cooled and 1 l. of water with 1 kg. of cracked ice are added. Benzenesulfonyl chloride sinks to the bottom, is separated, washed once with water, filtered if necessary, and distilled under reduced pressure for purification. The forerun, consisting of a little chlorobenzene, water, and a little benzenesulfonyl chloride, is discarded and the fraction boiling between 145–150° /45 mm. is collected. This weighs 330–360 g. (75–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The dried solution is transferred to a 2-l. flask fitted with a Claisen head attached to a 30-cm. Vigreux column. Benzene is removed fairly rapidly at about 200 mm. so that the benzene boils at 45–50°. After removal of most of the benzene, the pressure is slowly lowered to 10–15 mm.; a negligible amount of fore-run is obtained before the product begins to distil at about 65° at 15 mm. The product is collected until the temperature reaches 80–85° at the same pressure. The yield of 7-t-butyoxynorbornadiene is 42–51 g. (20–25%,, based on t-butyl perbenzoate). Gas-phase chromatographic analysis of the product shows it to be about 95% pure. Greater purity can be obtained, if required, by fractionation through a spinning band column; the pure product is collected at 70–72° (14 mm.).
B. Methyl L-2-(benzyloxycarbonylamino)-4-(methylsulfinyl)butanoate (3). A 5-L, three-necked, Morton flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel is charged with 2 (166.0 g, 0.56 mol) and methanol (1.5 L), and the solution is cooled to 0°C. A solution of sodium periodate (NaIO4) (131.4 g, 0.61 mol, 110 mol %) in water (2 L) is added dropwise over a period of 1.5 hr. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 18 hr. The product is vacuum-filtered through Celite and divided into two portions. Each portion is extracted with chloroform (6 × 200 mL), washed with water (300 mL) and brine (300 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature <30°C). The resulting oils are combined and further dried in a Kugelrohr oven (30°C, 0.1 mm, 12 hr), yielding the product as a waxy solid: 173.2 g, 99%.
The material is transferred to a modified Claisen flask having a fractionating side arm, and the chloroform is distilled completely under reduced pressure (without being condensed). The dimethylpyrrole is collected at 51–53°/8 mm. or 78–80°/25 mm.; only a small residue (4–5 g., b.p. 80–85°/25 mm.) remains. The product weighs 68–72 g. (81–86 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is quite pure; it should be stored in an inert atmosphere in a tightly sealed, dark glass container.
Five grams of potassium hydroxide (85% KOH) is dissolved in 100 ml. of methyl Cellosolve in a 500-ml. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and a heating mantle. Dicyandiamide (50.4 g.; 0.6 mole) and benzonitrile (50 g.; 0.48 mole) are added, and the mixture is stirred and heated. A solution is formed, and, when the temperature reaches 90–110°, an exothermic reaction begins and the product separates as a finely divided white solid. The vigor of the reaction is kept under control by the refluxing of the solvent.
A. Methyl 2-(1-cyanocyclohexyl)hydrazine carboxylate (1). A 100-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and gas-exhaust tube is charged with 9.0 g. (0.10 mole) of methyl carbazate, 20 ml. of methanol, 2 drops of acetic acid, and 9.8 g. (0.10 mole) of cyclohexanone. The resulting mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes, then cooled to 0° and treated with 6 ml. (0.15 mole) of hydrogen cyanide, added dropwise over a period of 3 minutes. After approximately 15 minutes the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature, during which time the hydrazine 1 crystallizes and. After 2 hours the resulting mixture is vacuum filtered, and the crystalline residue is washed with 10 ml. of cold methanol, yielding 17.7 g. of hydrazine 1. Concentration of the filtrate provides an additional 1.4 g. of product. The total yield of crude hydrazine 1, m.p. 130–133°, is 97%. Recrystallization (methanol–pentane) provides an analytically pure sample, m.p. 135–136°.
The distillate is shaken in the receiver with about 25 cc. of a 5 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide to remove any trace of sulfur dioxide that may be present. The hydrocarbon is separated and dried with 10 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. It is then distilled, the fraction boiling at 35–41° being collected. The yield is 92–112 g. (65–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
C. (2R,3R)-2,3-Dimethylsuccinic acid (4). A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask under an argon atmosphere equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 3.68 g (10.0 mmol) of 3, THF (50 mL), and water (40 mL). After purging the reaction flask with argon, the resulting mixture is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath. To this solution is added via syringe 30% aq.hydrogen peroxide (11 mL, ~102 mmol) over 5 min, followed by addition of lithium hydroxide monohydrate (1.68 g, 40 mmol) in one portion. The resulting solution is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. After being stirred for 18 h, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath, and the reaction is quenched with 1.5 M aqueous Na2SO3 solution (40 mL). The resulting mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 80 mL). The aqueous layer is transferred to a 250-mL single-neck round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath. Concentrated aq. hydrochloric acid (12 M, 20 mL) is added over 5 min. The resulting solution is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 60 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL). Drying the organic extracts with anhydrous sodium sulfate (15 g), filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 40 mm Hg) afford the crude product as a white solid. The product is dried in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum adapter and evacuating the flask (0.02 mmHg) for 24 h to afford 1.34 g, (92%) of 2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylsuccinic acid as a colorless solid.
B. (R,R)-1-Phenylcyclohexene oxide.3 A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4.5-cm, egg-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 1-phenylcyclohexene (7.91 g, 50.0 mmol) and the chiral ketone 1 (1.29 g, 5.00 mmol, 10 mol%). The flask is cooled in an ice-bath, and 75 mL of CH3CN and 75 mL of a solution which is 2.0M potassium carbonate and 4 × 10−4M EDTA are added. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C, and 20 mL (200 mmol) of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is added. The resulting mixture is vigorously stirred at 0°C for 6 hr, then diluted with 50 mL of hexane. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with three 200-mL portions of hexane, and the combined organic phases are washed with two 50-mL portions of 1M aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution and 100 mL of brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 0°C. The resulting oil is applied to 180 g of Whatman 60 Å (230-400 mesh) silica gel packed in a 5-cm diameter column, then the product is eluted with 600 mL of hexane and finally 1 L of 20:1 hexane:Et2O to afford 6.88-8.01 g (79-92%) of (R,R)-1-phenylcyclohexene oxide as a colorless oil.
A. Trimethylsilylmethylmagnesium chloride. Magnesium turnings (10.7 g, 0.44 g-atom) are placed in a dry, 300-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped with a rubber septum, a thermometer, another rubber septum, and a reflux condenser connected to an argon flow line. The apparatus is flushed with argon, and an argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction. Anhydrous diethyl ether (40 mL) and 0.1 mL of 1,2-dibromoethane are placed in the reaction flask with a syringe, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 min. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 45.4 g (0.37 mol) of chloromethyltrimethylsilane in 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether with a syringe. With stirring, about 10 mL of this solution is added at once. When the reaction has started, the remaining solution is added dropwise at such a rate that a gentle reflux is maintained throughout the addition (addition time ca. 2 hr). After the exothermic reaction subsides, the resulting solution is stirred at reflux by heating for an additional 1 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and is used in step B.
A. Ethyl thioamidooxalate.3 A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar. Ethyl cyanoformate (20 g, 0.20 mol,) in benzene (25 mL) is added to the reaction vessel and the mixture is cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. Diethylamine ((Note 2), 0.4 g, 5.5 mmol, 0.57 mL) is added to the stirring reaction mixture (0°C) and hydrogen sulfide is then bubbled into the reaction for an additional 15–20 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 25°C (14–16 hr). The crude product is collected by filtration and washed with benzene (2 × 3 mL) to give 20.96 g (78%) of pure ethyl thioamidooxalate. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product subjected to chromatography on silica gel (30% ether–hexane eluant) to give an additional 1.57 g of ethyl thioamidooxalate. The total amount of ethyl thioamidooxalate isolated as a bright-yellow solid is 22.53 g (84%); mp 63–66°C.
A. Preparation of (η5-carbomethoxycyclopentadienyl)-(η4-tetraphenyl-cyclobutadiene)cobalt. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a stirring bar, reflux condenser, rubber septa, and an argon inlet. The flask is flushed with dry argon and charged with sodium cyclopentadienide (20 mL, 2.0 M in THF, 40 mmol) and 20 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran via syringe. Dimethyl carbonate (10.2 mL, 120 mmol) is added via syringe and the resulting solution is warmed to reflux for 4 h before cooling to room temperature.
B. β-Methylglutaric anhydride. The residue described above is cooled in an ice bath during the successive addition of 200 ml. of water and 450 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resultant mixture is heated under reflux, with stirring, for 8 hours. The condenser is again set for distillation, the bath temperature is raised, and, with continued stirring, water and alcohol are distilled. The bath is finally heated to 180–190° until gas evolution ceases (usually about 1 hour).
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, and reflux condenser are placed 40 g. (0.41 mole) of 2-heptene, 48.1 g. (0.27 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide, 0.2 g. of benzoyl peroxide, and 250 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux in a nitrogen atmosphere for 2 hours. The succinimide is removed by suction filtration, washed twice with 15-ml. portions of carbon tetrachloride and the carbon tetrachloride washings are combined with the filtrate. The carbon tetrachloride solution is transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask modified so that the distilling arm carries a 25 × 300 mm. section packed with glass helices. The capillary is attached to a source of nitrogen and the carbon tetrachloride removed at 36–38°/190 mm..
A solution of 88 g. (1 mole) of freshly distilled pyruvic acid,1 128 g. (4 moles) of absolute methanol, 350 ml. of benzene, and 0.2 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask connected through a ground-glass joint to a methyl ester column shown in Fig. 202. The column is fitted at the top with a cold finger, a thermometer, and an efficient condenser. The solution is refluxed vigorously using an oil bath maintained at 150–155°. The temperature at the top of the column is 59–60°. After refluxing overnight, the liquid in the lower bubbler becomes cloudy and separates into two layers. The lower layer is removed as fast as it is formed (i.e., every 20–30 minutes) throughout the day. Refluxing is continued overnight, and the next morning the lower layer is again removed until cloudiness persists in the upper bubblers. The ester is then isolated by fractional distillation of the remaining liquid. The fraction boiling at 136–140° at atmospheric pressure is collected. It weighs 66–73 g. (65–71%) and.
The ice bath is removed, and 300 ml. of 8 N sodium nitrite is added in 20–30 minutes to the stirred solution, which is kept at 25–35° by intermittent cooling with the ice bath. Stirring is then discontinued, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 6 hours or longer.
The stirred mixture, maintained at or below 0°, is hydrolyzed by the addition of 200 ml. of distilled water during 5 minutes. It is then neutralized by addition of a solution of 84 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.7 l. of distilled water during 15 minutes. The mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, the ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether.
B. Ethyl 4-oxohexanoate (2). A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and Claisen condenser connected to a gas-measuring device is charged with 276 g. (1.20 mole) of succinate 1 and 74.1 g. (1.20 mole) of boric acid. The initially heterogeneous mixture is stirred and immersed in a 150° oil bath. Within 1 hour 36 g. of distillate (mainly ethanol) and approximately 2.3 l. of gas collect. As the temperature is raised to 170°, the rate of carbon dioxide evolution increases, a total of 24.9 l. of gas being collected after 1.5 hours. At this time gas evolution has almost ceased, and the reaction mixture has a clear, light-yellow appearance. The contents of the flask are cooled to room temperature, poured onto 1.5 l. of ice, and extracted with three 500-ml. portions of toluene. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The product is distilled through a 10-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 156–162 g. (82–85%) of ethyl 4-oxohexanoate, b.p. 109–112° (18 mm.). GC analysis indicates the material to be 99.2% pure.
Concentration of the filtrate to a volume of about 250 ml. and recrystallization from 95% ethanol of the crude isothiuronium salt which separates gives an additional 130 g. of material. The total yield of the salt is 1234 g. (90%).
Four hundred cubic centimeters of freshly distilled isoamyl alcohol (b.p. 128–132°) is heated to 90–100° on an oil bath in a 5-l. two-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel and reflux condenser. Two hundred forty grams (10.4 gram atoms) of clean sodium is then added, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised rapidly until the alcohol is brought to vigorous boiling. A solution of 100 g. (0.73 mole) of salicylic acid in 2 l. of isoamyl alcohol is allowed to flow into the flask at the rate of 100 cc. every four minutes, so that the entire amount is added over a period of eighty minutes. The dropping funnel is then rinsed with 100 cc. of isoamyl alcohol. The solution in the flask is clear at first, then becomes cloudy with the addition of the salicylic acid. The temperature of the oil bath is regulated so that the alcohol refluxes rapidly throughout the course of the experiment. The sodium goes completely into solution in seven to eight hours.
A 500-cc. round-bottomed flask is connected by a wide, bent glass tube to an efficient condenser, which is provided with an adapter leading into a 500-cc. receiving flask immersed in an ice bath. Two hundred grams (0.71 mole) of 1,2,3-tribromopropane and 10 cc. of water are placed in the reaction flask, and 50 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide in small lumps (not pulverized) is added at once with shaking. The mixture warms up and the flask is immediately connected to the apparatus and heated directly by means of a Bunsen burner held in the hand. It is advisable to use a slightly luminous flame about 15 cm. high and to heat with a rotary motion, directing the flame against the sides of the flask.
(A) Acetyl Methylurea.—To a solution of 59 g. (1 mole) of acetamide in 88 g. (0.55 mole) of bromine in a 4-l. beaker is added, dropwise and with hand stirring, a solution of 40 g. (1 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 160 cc. of water. The resulting yellow reaction mixture is heated on a steam bath until effervescence sets in, after which heating is continued for an additional two to three minutes. Crystallization of the product from the yellow to red colored solution usually commences immediately and is completed by cooling in an ice bath for one hour. The weight of the white crystalline acetyl methylurea obtained by filtration and air drying is 49–52 g. (84–90 per cent of the theoretical amount)(Note 5). It melts at 169–170°.
(A) Diazotization of Anthranilic Acid.—Fifty grams (0.365 mole) of anthranilic acid (m.p. 143–144°) is ground in a mortar with 150 cc. of water and 92 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The suspension is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath. When the contents have cooled to 0–5°, a solution of 26.3 g. (0.38 mole) of sodium nitrite in 350 cc. of water is added from a dropping funnel during thirty minutes. The resulting diazonium solution is kept at a temperature below 5° and, unless it is entirely clear, is filtered by suction through a chilled Büchner funnel immediately before use.
To this solution are added 196 g. (2 moles) of technical cyclohexanone and 500 cc. of 85 per cent ethyl alcohol; the cooling bath is replaced by a steam bath, the stirrer started, and the mixture heated to 75°. The flask is then packed in mineral wool or other insulating material and allowed to cool slowly, with effective stirring, for forty-eight hours. The solution at room temperature is exactly neutralized to litmus with a 50 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide, with cooling and stirring. About 330 g. of sodium hydroxide solution is required.
The residual liquid is diluted with 200 ml. of ether. The ether solution is washed twice with 100-ml. portions of 3% sodium carbonate solution. The combined carbonate solutions are extracted three times with 100-ml. portions of ether, and the ether solutions are combined and washed with 100 ml. of distilled water. The ether solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 129–131°/5 mm., nD25 1.4605–1.4610, is 280–292 g. (83–86%).
The reaction mixture is poured into 200 mL of ice water with vigorous stirring and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 30-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined methylene chloride extracts are washed with two 60-mL portions of a 1 : 1 mixture of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and water, and then with brine. The methylene chloride solution is dried over sodium sulfate and the methylene chloride is removed using a rotary evaporator.
After removal of the drying agent, the ester is fractionally distilled through an efficient fractionating column. A fore-run of 21–37 g. is collected up to a temperature of 95°. The pure ester distils between 95° and 96° and amounts to 129–148 g. (53–60%).
A. N,N-Diethyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetamide. A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and dropping funnel is charged with 73 g. (1.00 mole) of diethylamine, 500 ml. of ether, and a solution of 40 g. (1.00 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 160 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and maintained at a temperature of −10° to −15° by a bath of Dry Ice and acetone while 200 g. (1.10 moles) of trichloroacetyl chloride is added in the course of 1 hour. The cooling bath is removed, the temperature is allowed to rise to 10°, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with 50 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid, two 50-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and 50 ml. of water, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residue is distilled through a short indented Claisen still head at reduced pressure. N,N-Diethyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetamide is collected at 77–79°/1.5 mm.; nD25 1.4902–1.4912; weight 183–200 g. (84–92%).
B. Preparation of a solution of lithium di(Z-hexenyl)cuprate. A needle connected to an acetylene supply is introduced through the rubber septum of the flask, with its end at least 1 cm below the surface of the cuprate solution. The stopcock is fully opened toward the balloon, the solution is cooled to −50°C, and 2.64 L (0.11 mol) of acetylene is bubbled into the stirred cuprate solution, the temperature of which should not rise above −25°C. The gas inlet is removed and the greenish solution is stirred at −25°C for 30 min.
To 600 ml. of distilled water in a 1-l. beaker are added 30 g. (0.125 mole) of crystalline sodium sulfide nonahydrate, 15 g. (0.47 g. atom) of flowers of sulfur, and 27 g. (0.67 mole) of sodium hydroxide pellets. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 15–20 minutes with occasional stirring and then poured into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask containing a hot solution of 50 g. (0.36 mole) of p-nitrotoluene in 300 ml. of 95% ethanol. A reflux condenser is attached, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 3 hours. The resulting clear but deep red solution is rapidly steam-distilled until about 1.5–2 l. of condensate has been collected. The distillate should be clear when the distillation is stopped. The residue in the 2-l. flask should have a volume of 500–600 ml.; if less, it should be diluted to this volume with boiling water. The solution is rapidly chilled in an ice bath with occasional vigorous shaking and stirring to induce crystallization. After 2 hours in the ice bath the golden yellow crystals of p-aminobenzaldehyde are collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 500 ml. of ice water to remove sodium hydroxide. The product is immediately placed in a vacuum desiccator over solid potassium hydroxide pellets for 24 hours. The yield of p-aminobenzaldehyde, m.p. 68–70°, amounts to 18–22 g. (40–50%). The product contains some impurities but is pure enough for most purposes. It should be stored in a sealed bottle.
A piece of glass tubing 80 cm. long and 2 cm. in internal diameter is sealed at one end and loosely packed with 49 g. (0.25 mole) of benzophenone oxime (p. 70). The tube is supported in a nearly horizontal position, dipping slightly toward the closed end, and connected to a small filter flask by means of rubber stoppers and a piece of glass tubing bent at a right angle. The system is evacuated by means of a water pump, and dry carbon dioxide is admitted; the system is re-evacuated and carbon dioxide is admitted again. The oxime is then heated with a free flame, beginning at the upper end and heating at one spot until decomposition takes place before heating a further portion. When all the oxime has been decomposed, the mixture which has collected at the closed end of the tube is heated strongly for a short time to complete the decomposition, and allowed to cool. Suction is again applied to the tube, and the condensed water is driven out by gently warming the tube. The liquid is then transferred to a small distilling flask and distilled at a pressure of about 20 mm. The distillate, consisting of a mixture of benzophenone and diphenylmethane imine, is dissolved in 400 cc. of ligroin (60–90°), and the imine hydrochloride is precipitated by bubbling in dry hydrogen chloride. The salt is filtered with suction, washed with a little ligroin, dried, and preserved in a dry atmosphere. It sublimes without decomposition at 230–250°. The yield is 16–18 g. (59–66 per cent of theoretical amount).
A. Preparation of catalyst solution. A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a septum and magnetic stirring bar is charged with 486.9–488.2 mg (0.985–0.990 × 10−3 mol) of chloro(1,5-cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) dimer and, under argon, with 1.20 g (2.15 × 10−3 ml) of (2S, 4S)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-4-diphenylphosphino-2-diphenylphosphinomethylpyrrolidine, (S,S)-BPPM. The sealed flask is charged by cannula, under argon, with 150 mL of degassed benzene and stirred under argon for 15 min at room temperature. The catalyst is transferred by cannula, under argon, into the autoclave (see below).
In a 600-ml. beaker are mixed 85 g. (1 mole) of acetone cyanohydrin and 150 g. (1.31 moles) of freshly powdered ammonium carbonate. The mixture is warmed on a steam bath, preferably in a hood, and stirred with a thermometer. Gentle action begins around 50° and continues during about 3 hours at 68–80°. To complete the reaction and to decompose excess ammonium carbonate, the temperature is finally raised to 90° and maintained at this point until the liquid mixture is quiescent (30 minutes). The residue is colorless or pale yellow and solidifies on cooling. It is dissolved in 100 ml. of hot water, digested with Norit, and filtered rapidly through a heated filter. The filtrate is evaporated on a hot plate until crystals appear at the surface of the liquid, which is then chilled in an ice bath. The white crystals are filtered with suction; the filter cake is pressed and sucked dry and then washed twice with small portions (5–7 ml.) of ether, each portion being well incorporated with the crystals and then drawn through with suction. The mother liquor is concentrated as before to a volume of 25 ml. or less and chilled, and a further crop of crystals is obtained by repetition of the operations outlined. The yield is 65–72 g. (51–56%). The first crop is nearly pure and melts at 173°; the second crop melts at about 164°.
After 24 hr, the reaction mixture is diluted with chloroform (80 mL), and washed with water (150 mL) and 3 M sulfuric acid (2 × 150 mL). The water and sulfuric acid washings are each washed with 100 mL of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are washed with water (2 × 250 mL), dried with magnesium sulfate, and the solvent removed to give an orange–colored oil (10.3 g) that slowly crystallizes on standing. Crystallization from hexane gives 9.4 g (82%) of ethyl 1-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate, mp 49–50°C.
B. S-(2-Oxobut-3-yl) Butanethioate. A 750-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube is charged with 10.4 g. (0.100 mole) of thiobutyric acid in 300 ml. of anhydrous ether. With stirring, 10.1 g. (0.100 mole) of triethylamine is added in one portion. Over a 15-minute period, 15.1 g. (0.100 mole) of 3-bromo-2-butanone is added dropwise from the dropping funnel. The solution is heated at reflux with stirring for 1.5 hours and filtered through Celite®; the precipitate is washed with 60 ml. of ether. The ether solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual orange-yellow oil is dissolved in 20 ml. of 5:1 benzene–ether and filtered through 70 g. of silica gel, using 500 ml. of this solvent mixture as eluent. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, yielding 17.0–17.4 g. (98–100%) of the thiol ester as a pale yellow oil which can be used without further purification in the next step. and.
C. Furyl N,N,N',N'-tetramethyldiamidophosphate. To 180 mL of dry diethyl ether, chilled to −30°C, is added 56.7 g (4.2 equiv) (1.26 mmol) of dimethylamine. This solution is added—during 1–2 hr from a double-jacketed dropping funnel, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a cryostat regulated to −30°C—to a stirred mixture of 60 g (0.30 mol) of the freshly distilled furyl phosphorodichloridate and 250 mL of ether in a two-necked, 1-L flask equipped with a condenser, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube and connected to the cryostat. This flask is chilled in an ice bath during the addition of the first 2 equiv of the dimethylamine. After the addition of dimethylamine is complete, stirring is continued for 20 hr while the mixture is warmed on a water bath at 35°C. The hydrochloride that forms is carefully filtered off with suction and washed with two 70-mL portions of dry ether. The combined ether phases are evaporated to give ca. 65 g (99%) of crude product. Distillation, discarding a yellow forerun and collecting the fraction boiling at 149–152°C (20 mm) or 131–134°C (7 mm), affords 52–58 g (79–88%) of pure material.
A mixture of 26 g. (0.1 mole) of c.p. barium nitrate and 800 cc. of distilled water is warmed to 70°. After solution is complete 218 g. (0.9 mole) of c.p. copper nitrate trihydrate is added and the mixture stirred at 70° until a clear solution results.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 7.2 kg. of cracked ice and 2.4 kg. (1300 cc., 23.4 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The mixture becomes very cold and is kept at −5° to 0° by means of an ice-salt bath. Mechanical stirring is started and 600 g. (3.4 moles) of crude benzenesulfonyl chloride (p. 84) is gradually introduced (one-half hour). Then 1.2 kg. (16.5 atoms) of zinc dust (90 per cent) is added in portions as rapidly as possible without allowing the temperature to rise above that mentioned (this requires about one-half hour). The contents of the flask are stirred for one to one and one-half hours longer, the temperature being kept at 0° or below during the whole period. A stopper holding an efficient reflux condenser (lower end not constricted) and stirrer is now attached; the ice bath is removed; and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm up spontaneously or it may be warmed up with a low flame, the stirring being continued. Within a very few (two to five) minutes, in many runs, a rather vigorous reaction with the evolution of much hydrogen takes place. Under these circumstances it is advisable to cool the flask momentarily by a stream of water. The reflux condenser will, however, generally take care of the vapors satisfactorily.
A mixture of 105.6 g. (1.1 moles) of freshly distilled furfural, 87.0 g. (1.0 mole) of 98% cyanoacetic acid, 3.0 g. of ammonium acetate, 200 ml. of toluene, and 110 ml. of pyridine is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a Stark and Dean water trap and reflux condenser. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 days. The theoretical quantity of water is collected in the trap within 1 hour. Upon completion of the reflux period, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure by heating on a water bath. The residue, distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column at 11 mm. pressure, yields 88.6–93.3 g. (74.5–78%) of colorless liquid boiling at 95–97°, n25D 1.5823–1.5825.
The apparatus is arranged as in Fig. 7. In a bottle of about 1.5-l. capacity are placed 64.5 g. (0.5 mole) of di-n-butylamine,1 350 ml. of ligroin, and 350 ml. of 3 N sodium hydroxide. The bottle is fitted with an inlet tube which passes only 1 in. through the stopper. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and chlorine from a cylinder is passed in under pressure. The bottle is kept in the ice bath and is shaken during the addition to aid in absorption of the gas. The rate of shaking and the valve on the chlorine cylinder are so regulated that the pressure as indicated on the manometer is maintained between 100 and 150 mm.. The addition of the chlorine is continued until the white fumes of the hydrochloride, which form when chlorine comes in contact with the amine vapor, disappear, and the non-aqueous layer takes on a greenish yellow color, due to a slight excess of chlorine. This indicates that chlorination is complete.
C. Tetrakis(dimethylamino)diboron. A 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with an airtight mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 78 mL of toluene and 22.3 g (0.97 g-atom) of sodium . The mixture is brought to reflux with an oil bath and the sodium is finely pulverized by vigorous stirring. A solution of 135.6 g (0.758 mol) of bromobis(dimethylamino)borane in 55 mL of toluene is added dropwise at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux over 45 min. Shortly after the addition is begun, a deep-blue precipitate appears. The suspension is heated at reflux for an additional 2.5 hr. The slurry is cooled to room temperature, and filtered through a Celite pad on a sintered-glass funnel. The flask and filter cake are rinsed three times with 50 mL of toluene. The yellow filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure to give 54 g (72%) of tetrakis(dimethylamino)diboron as a colorless liquid, bp 92°C (12 mm), lit.3 bp 55-57°C (2.5 mm).
The crude product is purified by decolorization with charcoal and recrystallization from 100–150 ml. of diisopropyl ether, giving 19–21 g. (27–30%) of colorless needles, m.p. 70–72°. This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes. Further purification may be achieved by recrystallization from diisopropyl ether and/or sublimation at 60° (0.1 mm.) onto a cold-finger condenser, giving material melting at 73–74°,.
Formaldehyde solution equivalent to 60 g. of formaldehyde (2 moles) and 8 g. of potassium bicarbonate (small crystals) are placed in an 800-ml. beaker standing in a water bath at 20° in a hood. Mechanical stirring is started and 160 g. (1 mole) of diethyl malonate is added dropwise during about 40–50 min., at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is held at 25–30°. Stirring is continued for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. A saturated solution of ammonium sulfate (320 ml.) is added and the mixture is extracted with 320 ml. of ether. The ethereal extract, dried for 1 hour with anhydrous sodium sulfate (20 g.), is filtered into a 1-l., three-necked flask through a fluted filter paper. The sodium sulfate and paper are washed with 50 ml. of anhydrous ether. The flask (fitted with a thermometer reaching to the bottom, a condenser set for downward distillation; third neck closed) is placed in a suitable heating bath. Boiling chips are introduced and the ether is distilled until the temperature of the liquid has risen to 45–50°. The heating bath is then removed and the distillation assembly is replaced by a glass tube (about 4 mm. I.D.) reaching to the bottom of the flask and closed by a piece of rubber tubing and a screw clamp. An aspirator is now connected to the third neck of the flask. Vacuum is applied and volatile material is removed until the pressure falls to 20–30 mm. The temperature of the contents of the flask is brought to 40° and maintained there until crystallization begins and for an additional 30 minutes. Isopropyl ether (500 ml.) is added. The mixture is warmed to 50° and swirled until the product (crystalline and oily) dissolves. The solution is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and cooled in ice water with stirring until a thick suspension of crystals results. The suspension is refrigerated for 1 hour, filtered with suction (rubber dam), and the crystals are dried overnight at room temperature, and then in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid. The yield of colorless crystals, m.p. 48–50°, is 158–166 g. (72–75%). This product may be recrystallized from isopropyl ether (3.5 volumes) with an 85% recovery to yield material with m.p. 50–52°. Melting points of 52–53° and 52° are reported.2,3
The tert-butyl 2-methylenedodecanoate is hydrolyzed by heating under reflux with ethanolic potassium hydroxide for 6 hours; 40 ml. of 95% ethanol and 3.7 g. (0.056 mole) of 85% potassium hydroxide are used for each 10 g. (0.037 mole) of the ester. The hydrolysis mixture is cooled, diluted with three volumes of water, and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether which are discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified to Congo red with 5N sulfuric acid, and the 2-methylenedodecanoic acid is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of low-boiling petroleum ether. These extracts are combined, washed with three 100-ml. portions of water to ensure complete removal of tert-butyl alcohol, and dried by filtration through anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation, and the acid is subjected to rapid distillation from a Claisen flask. 2-Methylenedodecanoic acid containing less than 5% of 2-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid is collected at 149–151°/1.7 mm., m.p. about 32°, λmax 209 mμ, ε 7800, in hexane. The yield is 10.5–12 g. (35–40% from 2-methyldodecanoic acid), not including the acid obtained on acidification of the dehydrohalogenation mixture.
A flame-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a stirring bar and an argon inlet. The flask is flushed with argon and then charged with crude (η5-carboxycyclopentadienyl)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)-cobalt and 124 mL of methylene chloride. Oxalyl chloride (3.25 mL, 37.2 mmol) and dimethylformamide (3 drops) are added sequentially. Upon addition of the latter, gas evolution is observed. The resulting solution is maintained at room temperature. After 30 min, the solution is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Volatile byproducts and excess starting materials are removed by dissolving the residue in 100 mL of methylene chloride and concentrating this solution using a rotary evaporator. The evaporation procedure is repeating three times to provide the corresponding acid chloride as a red-brown residue, which is used directly in the next transformation.
A. Diethyl 2,2-diethoxyethylphosphonate. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 410 g. (2.08 moles) of bromoacetaldehyde diethyl acetal, and a gentle stream of nitrogen is then passed continuously through the system. To the stirred solution is added dropwise 316 g. (1.90 moles) of triethyl phosphite over a period of 30 minutes, at 110–120°. The mixture is then stirred for 3 hours at 160°. The ethyl bromide evolved is trapped with a condenser and a receiver cooled in an ice bath. The low-boiling material (below 100°) is distilled under reduced pressure (22 mm.). The residual oil is fractionated under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 101–103° (0.8 mm.) is collected, yielding 338 g. (70%).
B. N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-L-leucinal: Boc-L-leucinal. A 5-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and an air-cooled condenser fitted with an argon blanket adapter. The flask is charged under an argon blanket with 17.7 g (95% pure, 0.44 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride, and 1.5 L of anhydrous ethyl ether. The gray suspension is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr or until most of the solid is finely dispersed. The flask is immersed in a dry ice–2-propanol bath and the suspension cooled to −45°C. A solution of the Boc-L-leucine N-methyl-O-methycarboxamide, obtained in Part A, in 300 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether is placed in the addition funnel and added to the lithium aluminum hydride suspension in a steady stream while the reaction temperature is maintained −35° ± 3°C. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred and allowed to warm to +5°C. The mixture is once again cooled to −35°C and a solution of 96.4 g (0.71 mol) of potassium bisulfate in 265 mL of deionized water is placed in the addition funnel. This is added cautiously at first and then rapidly, while the temperature is allowed to rise to −2° ± 3°C. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture stirred for 1 hr. The reaction mixture is filtered through a 2-in. pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with two 500-mL portions of ethyl ether. The combined ether layers are washed in sequence with three 350-mL portions of cold (5°C) 1 N hydrochloric acid, two 350-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and 350 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated on a rotary evaporator (bath at 30°C). The residual, slightly cloudy syrup weighs 69–70 g (87–88%), [α]23 −49 to −51° (1.65% in methanol). The product is stored in a freezer (−17°C) prior to use. It solidifies readily at 5°C.
The residue is dissolved in 300 ml. of water. The solution is poured onto 200 g. of ice and acidified to a pH of about 4 by addition of 75 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid. The resulting mixture is extracted with four 100-ml. portions of peroxide-free ether, and the combined extracts are washed with 50 ml. of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride and dried over 2 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether solution is separated from the drying agent and concentrated at room temperature under reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled from a 25-ml. Claisen flask with an indented neck. 1,4-Dihydrobenzoic acid is obtained as a colorless oil; weight 9.0–9.7 g. (89–95%); b.p. 80–98°/0.01 mm.; n24D 1.5011. This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes. However, by a careful redistillation, a small fore-run (b.p. 80–90°/0.01 mm.; n24D 1.5000) can be separated, and the remainder of the material (b.p. 91–97°/0.01 mm.; n24D 1.5019) solidifies on cooling; m.p. 15–17°. It is stored under nitrogen in a closed vessel.
In the reaction flask are placed 15.4 g. (0.1 mole) of phenacyl chloride and 100 ml. of dry ether. The stirrer is started, and, after the solid has dissolved, anhydrous hydrogen chloride is introduced at the rate of 2–3 bubbles per second. Ten and three-tenths grams (11.8 ml., 0.1 mole) of freshly distilled n-butyl nitrite1 is then admitted from the dropping funnel in 0.5- to 1-ml. portions. After addition of the first portion of nitrite the reaction mixture becomes orange-brown, and after several minutes, light yellow; at this point a second portion of nitrite is added and a similar color change takes place, whereupon a third portion is added; further additions are made until all the butyl nitrite has been added. The reaction mixture warms up, and the ether begins to reflux gently. After all the nitrite has been added (about 30 minutes is required), stirring and addition of hydrogen chloride are continued an additional 15 minutes. At this point, the solution will have practically ceased boiling and will have assumed an orange color.
The ketone is separated from the water in the distillate, either by salting out with calcium chloride or by extracting with a little ether. It is washed with a little aqueous alkali and then with water, dried over calcium chloride, and distilled through a good fractionating column. The fraction boiling at 128–131° is cyclopentanone. The yield is 86–92 g. (75–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Into a 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing dimethyl-bis(phenylethynyl)silane (1) (4.37 g, 16.8 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon) is added 120 mL of THF via syringe. The resulting silane solution is added to the lithium naphthalenide dropwise, over a minimum of 20 min, via cannula. Once the addition is complete, the solution is cooled to -10 °C using an acetone bath with a small amount of dry ice.
B. Methyl (2R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-4-pentenoate. A 100-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, two dropping funnels, and an argon inlet is charged with 20 mL of methylene chloride and (R)-(+)-1,1'-bi-naphthol (100 mg, 0.35 mmol). The suspension is stirred until the binaphthol is completely dissolved. Powdered molecular sieves 4 Å (2 g) are then added. To the resultant suspension is added a 0.2 M toluene solution of diisopropoxytitanium dibromide (1.75 mL, 0.35 mmol) by syringe at room temperature. After stirring for 1 hr at room temperature, the reaction mixture is cooled to −35°C. To the reaction mixture is added dropwise a mixture of α-methylstyrene (14 mL, 108 mmol) and methylene chloride (5 mL) followed by a solution of freshly distilled methyl glyoxylate (6.16 g, 70.0 mmol) in methylene chloride (20 mL) over 30 min. The mixture is stirred at −35° to −30°C for 6 hr. Progress of the reaction is monitored by thin layer chromatography. Even after 6 hr, a small amount of unreacted methyl glyoxylate is detected. The solution is poured into saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate (30 mL). The molecular sieves are removed by filtration through a pad of Celite, and the filtrate is extracted with ethyl acetate (80 mL × 3). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (50 mL × 2). The extract is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure. Fractional distillation gives 12.1 g (84%) of methyl 2-hydroxy-4-phenyl-4-pentenoate and. The enantiomeric purity is 93–95% ee by HPLC analysis using a chiral column or by lanthanide induced shift (LIS) NMR measurement with (+)-Eu(dppm)3 after conversion to the α-methoxy ester.
The reaction mixture is poured with vigorous stirring into 750 ml. of ice-cold 10% sodium hydroxide solution, the solid is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is decanted. To the residue is added 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and the mixture is heated until the solid is completely melted. The two liquid phases are thoroughly mixed by stirring, the mixture is cooled to 5° in an ice bath, and the supernatant liquid is decanted. The product is then heated with 500 ml. of 10% acetic acid until molten, stirred thoroughly, and cooled to room temperature. The aqueous liquor is decanted, and the cycle is repeated with 500 ml. of 1% sodium hydroxide solution. The solid 2-bromo-4-nitrotoluene is collected on a Büchner funnel and thoroughly washed with water. The moist product may be used directly in the next stage of the synthesis. It can be dried to yield 93–97 g. (86–90%) of light-brown material melting at 75–76°.
A. 2-(4-Chlorophenyl)-N-methylacetamide (2). A three-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 4-cm magnetic stir bar, a temperature probe, a 50-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser with a nitrogen gas inlet adaptor. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for a minimum of 15 min and charged with 4-chlorophenyl acetic acid (50.0 g, 293 mmol) and 100 mL of anhydrous toluene under nitrogen. Anhydrous DMF (2.28 mL, 2.15 g, 29.3 mmol, 0.1 equiv) is added and the mixture is heated to 35 Â¿C with a heating mantle. SOCl2 (25.6 mL, 41.9 g, 352 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is added through the addition funnel over 30 min at such a rate that the internal temperature is maintained at <40 Â¿C. The resulting light brown solution is stirred at 40 Â¿C and monitored by HPLC until the reaction is complete.
A. Cholesterol dibromide. In a 4-l. beaker 150 g. (0.39 mole) of commercial cholesterol is dissolved in 1 l. of absolute ether by warming on the steam bath and stirring with a stout glass rod; the solution is then cooled to 25°. A second solution is prepared by adding 5 g. of powdered anhydrous sodium acetate (0.06 mole) to 600 ml. of acetic acid, stirring the mixture and breaking up the lumps with a flat stirring rod; 68 g. (0.4 mole) of bromine is then added and the solution is poured with stirring into the cholesterol solution. The solution turns yellow and promptly sets to a stiff paste of dibromide. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath to 20°, and then the product is collected on a 16-cm. Büchner funnel. The cake is pressed down and washed with acetic acid until the filtrate is completely colorless; 500 ml. is usually sufficient. A second crop of satisfactory dibromide is obtained by adding 800 ml. of water to the combined filtrate and washings, collecting the precipitate, and washing it with acetic acid until colorless. Dibromide moist with acetic acid is satisfactory for most transformations; dry dibromide, even when highly purified by repeated crystallization, begins to decompose (darkens) within a few weeks. When material prepared as described is dried to constant weight at room temperature, it is obtained as the 1:1 dibromide/acetic acid complex. Yields obtained in the first and second crops, respectively, are: 171–186 g. and 13–25 g., total yield 197–199 g. (84–85%).
The product thus obtained is pure enough for most purposes. However, a purer product may be obtained by recrystallization from dilute alcohol in the presence of decolorizing carbon. When 50 g. of crude product is dissolved in 200 cc. of 75 per cent alcohol, boiled for about ten minutes with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite), filtered, and the solution cooled to 0°, 40 g. of white product is obtained. The recrystallized product melts at 80–81°. A second recrystallization raises the melting point to 82–83°.
The reaction mixture is poured into a separatory funnel containing about 0.5 kg. of crushed ice and is shaken thoroughly. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic solution is washed three times with 75-ml. portions of water. A crystal of hydroquinone is added to the methylene chloride solution which is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue is distilled to give the crude product, b.p. 68–74° (0.9 mm.). After redistillation there is obtained 60–66 g. (81–89%) of mesitaldehyde; b.p. 113–115° (11 mm.), n20D 1.5538.
The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, filtered through a sintered glass funnel to remove inorganic salts, and the cake is washed with toluene (75 mL). The combined filtrate and wash are washed with water (150 mL). The organic layer is separated, and placed in a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The toluene solution is concentrated by reduced pressure distillation with mechanical stirring (45-50°C, 25-30 mm) to a volume of approximately 120 mL, and the final volume is adjusted to approximately 250 mL with toluene.
The solid obtained after column chromatography is placed in a 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (egg shaped, 2 × 1 cm) and a reflux condenser. Heptane (40 mL) and toluene (20 mL) are added, and the suspension is heated to 115 °C (700 rpm). Toluene is added in 5 mL portions through the reflux condenser over 20-30 30 min until a clear solution is obtained (the total volume of toluene used is 40 mL). A gas bubbler is placed on top of the condenser and connected to the argon line. The heating source is turned off and the clear (yellow solution) is allowed to cool down to rt overnight (14 h) under argon, while stirring is maintained. The obtained suspension is cooled down to 0 °C with the help of an ice bath and stirred for 1 h. The resulting solid is collected by filtration using a 50-mL Büchner funnel under a stream of nitrogen and washed with ice-cold heptane (3 × 20 mL). The obtained solid is transferred to a 100-mL round-bottomed flask and dried overnight (>12 h) at 0.1 mbar to provide the title compound as a white solid (5.98 g, 32.3 mmol, 65%).
Then 410 g. (251 cc., 3 moles) of bromoacetone (p. 88) is added, and the mixture is refluxed for sixteen hours on a water bath at 95–97°. At the end of the operation the solution is cooled to 0° in an ice-salt bath. The potassium bromide which settles is filtered on a cooled suction filter, and the filtrate is fractionated.
Once the reaction mixture changes color to black, it is allowed to cool to room temperature before filtering though a pad of diatomaceous earth (15 g, wetted with 40 mL of diethyl ether and packed firmly in place) in a 350-mL course-fritted glass Büchner funnel.The reaction vessel is rinsed with ether (3 × 50 mL) and these rinses are filtered as well.The filtrate is poured into a 1 L separatory funnel containing 150 mL of 1 M NH4Cl(aq). The organic layer is separated and set aside.The aqueous layer is then extracted with additional ether (3 × 60 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (75 mL) and brine (75 mL), then dried over MgSO4 (15 g, ~1 min). The solids are removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass Buchner funnel and washed with ether (20 mL). The filtrate is then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 74 mmHg) to give a colorless oil.The aqueous layers are combined and set aside for later recovery of DMPU, if desired.
B. Diphenylacetaldehyde. A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a gas inlet, rubber septum, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with 3.42 g (12 mmol) of 4-bromo-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol and flushed with argon, after which 600 mL of freshly distilled dichloromethane is added. The mixture is stirred, degassed under vacuum, flushed with argon, and 3 mL (6 mmol) of a 2 M hexane solution of trimethylaluminum (Me3Al,) is injected through the septum to the flask at room temperature. The resulting solution is stirred at this temperature for 1 hr to give methylaluminum bis(4-bromo-2,6-di-tert-butylphenoxide) almost quantitatively. The reaction vessel is cooled to a temperature of −20°C in a dry ice/o-xylene bath. Then 11.8 g (60 mmol) of trans-stilbene oxide is dissolved in 25 mL of dry dichloromethane, transferred to the dropping funnel, and added over 15–20 min at −20°C. The mixture is stirred at −20°C for 4 hr. After addition of 1.01 g (24 mmol) of sodium fluoride, 324 μL (18 mmol) of water is injected dropwise at −20°C. The entire mixture is vigorously stirred at −20°C for 5 min and at 0°C for 30 min. The contents of the flask are filtered with the aid of three 50-mL portions of dichloromethane,(Note 12),(Note 13),(Note 14),(Note 15). The combined filtrates are concentrated to ca. 100 mL under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Silica gel (35 g) is added and the remainder of the dichloromethane is removed using a rotary evaporator. The residue is layered on a column of silica gel (500 g, column diameter: 9.5 cm) and eluted (ether/dichloromethane/hexane, 1:2:20 to 1:1:10 as eluants) to give 10.3 g (87%) of diphenylacetaldehyde as a colorless oil and.
The hydrocarbon layer is separated, cooled in ice, and washed with four 50-cc. portions of cold concentrated sulfuric acid. The material is then washed twice with warm water (50°), twice with 3 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and twice with pure water. The hydrocarbon mixture is dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and subjected twice to fractional distillation, using a 30-cm. Vigreux or similar column; the cyclohexylbenzene is collected at 238–243° and. The yield is 210–220 g. (65–68 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. "Acetone-anil". A mixture of 279 g. (3 moles) of aniline and 9 g. of iodine is placed in a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask. The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel (the delivery tube of which extends below the liquid surface), a mercury-sealed stirrer, and an adapter carrying a thermometer which extends into the liquid and a condenser system such that most of the aniline will return and all the water produced (as well as excess acetone) will distil. The flask is now heated in an oil bath and, and the reaction mixture is maintained at 170–175° while acetone is passed in through the dropping funnel at such a rate that no more than 2 drops of liquid distils per second. During the addition the mixture is vigorously stirred. A total volume of 850 ml. (670 g., 11.6 moles) of acetone is added over a 4-hour period, and about 610 ml. of distillate is collected. At the end of this period the reaction mixture is cooled and distilled in vacuum, three fractions being collected (up to 136°/15 mm., 136–141°/15 mm., and 141–146°/15 mm.). The acetone-water distillate is now distilled through a simple column at atmospheric pressure until essentially all the acetone has come over. There remains a mixture of oil and water which is separated after being cooled. The oil is then used as the first fraction for a fractional distillation in vacuum of the reaction product, each of the previous fractions being added in succession. Three new fractions are collected: 78–82°/13 mm. (a little aniline); 82–133°/13 mm. (a small intermediate fraction); and 133–138°/13 mm. (acetone-anil). An appreciable quantity of tarry residue remains in the distillation flask. The yield based upon aniline actually consumed in the reaction is 61–68%.
The crude product is placed in a 250-ml. flask containing a capillary inlet tube through which carbon dioxide is admitted. Ten grams of hydroquinone and 15 g. of diphenyl ether are added, and the flask is attached to a suitable fractionating column. The product is fractionated carefully at 135 mm. pressure. The pressure is lowered gradually when most of the ethyl acrylate has distilled, and at about 70°/90 mm. the receiver is changed. The first fraction (mostly ethyl acrylate) amounts to 9–10 g. The pressure is lowered further to 50 mm., and the acrylic acid is distilled fairly rapidly, without reflux, at 69–71°/50 mm. The acrylic acid fraction weighs 108–116 g. and is 95–97% pure according to acidimetric titration. The yield is 68–75% based upon 100% acrylic acid content and.
C. Cyclopropenone. A stirred solution of 3.0 g. (0.030 mole) of 3,3-dimethoxycyclopropene in 30 ml. of dichloromethane, cooled to 0°, is treated dropwise with 5 ml. of cold water containing 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0° for an additional 3 hours before 30 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate is added in portions, with stirring, to the 0° solution. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is evaporated at 50–80 mm. with a water bath maintained at 0–10°. The brown, viscous residue is then distilled at 1–2 mm, at a water bath temperature of 10°. The distillate, a mixture of methanol and dichloromethane, is collected in a receiver cooled to −78°. A new receiver is attached, and the bath temperature is gradually raised to 35°, yielding 1.42–1.53 g. (88–94%) of cyclopropenone as a white solid, b.p. 26° (0.46 mm.), m.p. −29 to −28°.
B. (E)-3-[(E)-3-Phenyl-2-propenoxy]acrylic acid. An oven dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser is purged with argon and charged with 8.20 g (0.171 mol) of 50% sodium hydride in oil and 90 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. To this mixture is added a solution of 19.0 g (0.143 mol) of cinnamyl alcohol in 180 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at which point 25.0 g (0.194 mol) of (E)-(carboxyvinyl)trimethylammonium betaine is added and the reaction mixture is heated at a gentle reflux for 15 hr. The cooled reaction mixture is slowly added to a mixture of 600 mL of water and 220 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride. The residual material is removed with wet ether and added to the aqueous solution. The aqueous layer is washed 3 times with 450 mL of ether and acidified with approximately 21 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid to pH 1. This mixture is extracted 3 times with 700 mL of ether and the ether layer is dried with 20 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 min. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated, first with a rotary evaporator and then at 0.1 mm for 24 hr at 25°C to give crude (E)-3-[(E)-3-phenyl-2-propenoxy]acrylic acid. This material can be used in Part C without further purification. However, purification by trituration with approximately 30 mL of anhydrous ether gives 24.7–25.0 g (85% yield) of white crystalline product, mp 140–141.5°C (dec).
B. 3-Acetyl-2-oxazolidinone. A 3-L, one-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 326 g (3.75 mol) of 2-oxazolidinone, 94 g (1.15 mol) of anhydrous sodium acetate, and 1.6 L of acetic anhydride. The stirred solution is refluxed for 3 hr and the acetic anhydride is then removed by distillation at 15–20 mm. The residue is extracted with three 875–mL portions of boiling toluene, and the hot toluene extractions are filtered, combined, and concentrated to a total volume of 675 mL. Diethyl ether (675 mL) is added with stirring to the toluene solution and the mixture is chilled in an ice–water bath. The precipitate is removed by filtration and washed with 250 mL of diethyl ether to give 328–403 g (68–83%) of colorless to very light tan crystals, mp 65–67°C [lit.2 mp 69–70°C]. A second crop of 63–24 g (13–5%), mp 65–68°C, is obtained by concentrating the filtrate to 275 mL and chilling it in an ice–water bath.
Tubes E and F are now closed, stopper B is loosened, and C is flushed out with nitrogen admitted through tube A. Deaerated water (100 ml.) is placed in C, which is then flushed with nitrogen. To this water is added alloxan monohydrate (16.0 g.; 0.1 mole), and the mixture is stirred with A, while the nitrogen stream is continued, until the solid has dissolved. B is now pushed down to give a tight fit, a slight pressure of nitrogen is applied (at A), F and D are opened, and the solution is allowed to pass from C into H. To wash out traces of alloxan, a further 10 ml. of water is placed in C and run into H. D is closed, and nitrogen is passed in at E and out of F until the solutions are thoroughly mixed. E and F are now closed, and the mixture in H is allowed to stand until crystallization is complete (overnight). In the meantime, the stem of funnel H is inserted in one hole of the two-holed rubber stopper L (also bearing inlet tube K); L is inserted in the mouth of M (a 150-ml., Pyrex Büchner funnel with coarse, fritted-glass septum); and the stem of M is inserted in the rubber stopper N placed in the neck of a 2-liter Büchner flask P (side arm, Q). To flush out M and P, nitrogen is passed in at K and out of Q. K and Q are now closed, F is opened, and a slight pressure of nitrogen is applied at F. Q and J are opened, and, if necessary, slight suction is applied at Q. When all the suspension has passed out of H, the nitrogen stream is continued for a few minutes, to remove as much as possible of the liquid clinging to the precipitate in M. Then F, J, and Q are closed. The Büchner funnel M and its contents are quickly removed, placed in a vacuum desiccator (preflushed with nitrogen), and dried to constant weight, at room temperature, over phosphorus pentoxide and soda-lime. The yield is 27–27.5 g. (84–85%),, and.
B. 1-Bromo-1-methyl-2-(bromomethylsulfonyl)cyclohexane. Four Pyrex test tubes (2.5 × 20 cm) are charged with 1-methylcyclohexene (5.0 g per test tube; total weight 20.0 g, 0.21 mol). Methylene chloride (12 mL) is added to each test tube, which is cooled in ice. An ice-cold solution of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide (13.6 g of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide per test tube; total weight 54.4 g, 0.23 mol) in methylene chloride (12 mL) is added to each test tube with mixing at 0°C. The test tubes are attached with the help of several rubber bands to a Pyrex immersion well equipped with a 45-W mercury lamp. The immersion well is cooled by circulation of ice water and immersed in a cooling bath maintained at −15°C. The reaction mixture is irradiated for 2 hr. Solid potassium carbonate (1.5 g) is added to each test tube and the contents of the test tubes are filtered through a small column with a glass wool plug into a 250-mL round-bottomed flask. Methylene chloride is removed, first on a rotary evaporator and then with a vacuum pump (1 mm), to give an oil that gradually solidifies (68.3 g, 98%). Recrystallization from 95% ethanol (100 mL) gives white crystals (54.3 g, 78%), mp 59–61°C.
(A) Benzalazine.—In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a stout glass mechanical stirrer, are placed 240 g. (1.85 moles) of powdered hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309), 1.8 l. of water, and 230 cc. (207 g., 3.4 moles) of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The mixture is stirred, and, when the hydrazine sulfate has dissolved, 440 cc. (460 g., 4.35 moles) of benzaldehyde is added from a separatory funnel during the course of four to five hours. After the mixture has been stirred for a further two hours, the precipitated benzalazine is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed thoroughly on a Büchner funnel. The product is dissolved in 800 cc. of boiling 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and, on cooling, the azine separates in yellow needles melting at 92–93°. The yield is 350–360 g. (91–94 per cent of the theoretical amount); an additional 10–15 g. of less pure material can be isolated from the mother liquors. The azine is freed of ethyl alcohol by drying in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride.
A 500-ml. three-necked flask is equipped with a Trubore stirrer, reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel that carries an inlet for admission of nitrogen. The system is purged with nitrogen, and 300 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added, followed by 7.2 g. (0.312 g. atom) of sodium either as wire or freshly cut small pieces. The solution is stirred, and 31.0 ml. (0.376 mole) of cyclopentadiene is added dropwise. When the evolution of hydrogen has almost ceased, the mixture is maintained at slightly below the reflux temperature for 1–2 hours. In the event that all the sodium does not dissolve, the solution is cooled to room temperature, a few milliliters more of cyclopentadiene added, and the mixture heated again until dissolution of the sodium is complete.
In a 600-ml. screw-capped bottle are placed 15.4 g. (0.32 mole) of sodium cyanide, 20.5 g. (0.16 mole) of hydrazine sulfate, and 400 ml. of ice water. The bottle is capped to prevent loss of hydrogen cyanide and held in an ice bath for 15 minutes. To the cooled mixture is added 29.4 g. (0.3 mole) of cyclohexanone. The bottle is recapped and cooled for an additional 15 minutes. The bottle is then shaken intermittently over a period of 6 hours and allowed to stand an additional 14 hours. The bottle is cooled again before opening. The suspension is filtered by means of suction, and the cake is washed thoroughly with 250 ml. of ice water. After the crude product has been pressed dry on the filter, it is transferred to a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and 150 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol is added. The suspension is brought into solution as rapidly as possible by warming on a hot plate and is filtered quickly through a prewarmed 7.5-cm. Büchner funnel. An additional 10 ml. of hot 95% ethanol is used to dissolve any organic residue on the filter, and the combined filtrates are warmed to redissolve any precipitate. The solution is allowed to stand undisturbed for 6 hours in an icebox. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 15 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and then dried over solid calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of product is 24.5–26 g. (66–70%); m.p. 147–149°.
(B) Aminothymol.—The crude, wet nitrosothymol so obtained is worked up with a mixture of 900 cc. of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and 1600 cc. of water; the brown solution is filtered free of a little resinous matter, and hydrogen sulfide is passed into it. The brown color disappears and a white precipitate of aminothymol forms. The passage of hydrogen sulfide is continued for thirty minutes longer, when the base is filtered and washed well with cold water, contact with air being avoided as far as possible.
B. Ethyl 2-methyl-3-methylthioindole-5-carboxylate. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a two-necked adapter holding a low-temperature thermometer and a gas-inlet tube. The flask is charged with 16.5 g. (0.100 mole) of ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (Benzocaine) and 500 ml. of dichloromethane, and a positive pressure of dry nitrogen is established while the solution is stirred and cooled to −70° with a 2-propanol–dry-ice bath. The resulting suspension is stirred vigorously, and a solution of 10.8 g. (0.0995 mole) of tert-butyl hypochlorite [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 184 (1973)] in 50 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise over a 10-minute period. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour at −70°, followed by dropwise addition of a solution of 10.4 g. (0.100 mole) of methylthio-2-propanone in 50 ml. of dichloromethane over 10 minutes. A slight exotherm (ca. 5°) is noted during the addition, resulting in a clear yellow solution. After stirring for another hour at −70°, during which time a suspension of precipitated salts forms, a solution of 10.1 g. (0.100 mole) of triethylamine in 30 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise over 10 minutes. After an additional 15 minutes at −70°, the cooling bath is removed.
A solution of reagent grade hydrated copper acetate is made by dissolving 240 g. of the salt in 3 l. of water at about 85° and filtering from any basic acetate. The copper salt of acetylacetone is then precipitated by adding 1.4 l. of the hot copper acetate solution to the first fraction of the acetylacetone, 700 ml. to the second, 500 ml. to the third, and 400 ml. to the fourth fraction. After standing for 3 hours, or better overnight, in a refrigerator the salt is filtered, washed once with water, and sucked dry. The salt is shaken in a separatory funnel with 800 ml. of 20% sulfuric acid and 800 ml. of ether, and the ether layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with 400 ml. and then 200 ml. of ether. The combined extracts are dried with 250 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation. The residue is distilled through a Widmer column and yields 160–170 g. of acetylacetone boiling at 134–136° (80–85% based on acetone).
A. 1,4-Dithiaspiro[4.11]hexadecane. A mixture of 46.5 g (0.26 mol) of cyclododecanone, 24.1 g (21.5 mL, 0.26 mol) of 1,2-ethanedithiol, and 0.75 g (0.004 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, in 200 mL of toluene is placed in a 500-mL, three-necked reaction flask equipped for reflux under a water separator.2 The mixture is heated at reflux for several hours until the theoretical amount of water (0.26 mol = 4.6 mL) has collected in the Dean-Stark trap. The reaction mixture is cooled and transferred to a separatory funnel. The mixture is washed with water, the toluene is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is placed under reduced pressure (< 0.1 mm) for several hours to remove traces of solvent. Approximately 66 g (99%) of a white solid is recovered (0.26 mol, mp 84–86°C). The crude material is pure by GLC and TLC, and is used in the next step with no further purification.
If the acrylic acid is not to be used at once, it is stabilized by the addition of hydroquinone and is stored in a refrigerator.
The pressure in the flask is restored to that of the atmosphere. The flask is removed from the oil bath and equipped with a dropping funnel, condenser, and mechanical stirrer. To the salt is added 350 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride; the stirrer is started, and 117 g. (40 ml., 0.73 mole) of dry bromine (p. 790, Note 2) is added through the dropping funnel over a 30- to 40-minute period. Occasional cooling may be necessary as the reaction is quite vigorous at first. When all the bromine has been added, the mixture is heated for 1 hour on a steam bath. It is then filtered and the silver bromide washed thoroughly on the filter with 100 ml. of warm carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate is washed once with 100 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution and dried over 30–40 g. of Drierite. The solvent is removed and the residue distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 75–80°/4 mm. is 101–106 g. The yield is 65–68% based on the weight of the methyl silver adipate before drying under reduced pressure, or 52–54% based upon methyl hydrogen adipate.
The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is poured into 4 l. of cold water. The upper layer is separated and allowed to stand for two hours over about 500 cc. of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution with frequent shaking or mechanical stirring. This decomposes any excess of acetic anhydride. It is finally washed with about 3 l. of water. The benzene solution is distilled under ordinary pressure to remove the benzene (800–900 cc. is recovered). The 2-furylmethyl acetate is distilled under diminished pressure, b.p. 69–70°/7 mm. The yield is 750–800 g. (87–93 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The toluene solution is cooled to 10-15°C and hydrochloric acid (HCl) in 2-propanol (0.275 mol) is added slowly over 1 hr via a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, keeping the internal temperature below 25°C. During the acid addition the product precipitates as its hydrochloride salt. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 2 hr, and is reduced in volume by distillation under reduced pressure (45-50°C, 25-30 mm) with mechanical stirring to produce a distillate of approximately 120 mL and a residual volume of about 100 mL. Toluene (50 mL) is added and the slurry is reconcentrated under reduced pressure (45-50°C, 25-30 mm) until a residual volume of 100 mL is obtained. This process is repeated once more. Toluene is added to adjust the total volume to about 250 mL. The mixture is then cooled to 10-15°C and stirred under nitrogen at this temperature for 2 hr. The HCl salt is isolated by filtration and the wet cake is washed with toluene (2 × 50 mL).
One hundred grams (0.21 mole) of finely powdered arginine dinitronaphtholsulfonate is added, all at once, to 230 cc. of cold 2 N sodium hydroxide; the salt dissolves readily on agitation. There is then added without delay 35 g. (0.33 mole) of benzaldehyde, in four portions and with vigorous shaking, each portion being accompanied by 75 cc. of ice-cold water. During this process, benzylidenearginine separates as a crystalline cake. The mixture is allowed to stand at 15–20° for one to two hours, whereupon the product is filtered and washed successively with two to four 50-cc. portions of ice-cold water, three 20-cc. portions of a mixture of 20 cc. of methyl alcohol and 40 cc. of ether, and finally two 50-cc. portions of ether. It is then dried in air. The yield is 39–43 g., corresponding to about 44–48 g. from 500 g. of gelatine.
A 500 ml., Parr hydrogenation bottle is flushed with nitrogen, and 20.0 g. of 5% rhodium-on-alumina is weighed directly into the hydrogenation bottle. The catalyst is wet by cautiously adding 25 ml. of 95% ethanol, and a solution of 40.0 g. (0.278 mole) of 1-naphthol in 125 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to the bottle, along with 3 ml. of acetic acid. The mixture is shaken in a Parr apparatus at an initial pressure of 55–60 p.s.i. of hydrogen. The theoretical hydrogen absorption is reached in about 12 hours. The catalyst is removed by suction filtration and washed twice with 50-ml. portions of ethanol. The combined ethanol solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, yielding a viscous residue (39–41 g.), which is dissolved in 150 ml. of benzene. The solution is washed with 75 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, then with 75 ml. of water, dried over magnesium sulfate for at least 3 hours, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, giving 39–41 g. (94–97%) of a mixture3 consisting of the geometrical isomers of 1-decalol. cis,cis-1-Decalol may be isolated as a crystalline solid from the mixture by the addition of 15–20 ml. of heptane, followed by cooling. The product is isolated by filtration and recrystallized from a minimum amount of n-heptane, yielding 13–14 g. (30–33%) of cis,cis-1-decalol, m.p.4 92–93°.
C. 16α-Fluoro-3-methoxy-1,3,5(10)-estratrien-17-one (16α-fluoroestrone 3-methyl ether). The 125-mL, round-bottomed flask containing the enol silyl ether from Part B is purged with argon, and 50 mL of dry dichloromethane is added. N-Fluoropyridinium triflate (1) (6.5 g, 0.026 mol) is added in one portion, and the mixture is stirred at 20–25°C for 8 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into water and extracted with three 60-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate and then with water, and dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the solution is evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator. The resulting pale-yellow solid is column-chromatographed on silica gel (250 g, 60 × 4.5-cm column) using dichloromethane eluant to give 950 mg (14%) of estrone 3-methyl ether starting material and 4.8 g (66%) of 16α-fluoroestrone 3-methyl ether as a colorless solid, mp 157°C,(Note 18),(Note 19).
A. Ethyl sec-butylidenecyanoacetate.. In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 24/40 joint are placed 0.45 g. of β-alanine, 113 g. (106 ml., 1.0 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate, 87 g. (108 ml., 1.2 moles) of butanone, 20 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and 100 ml. of benzene. A Barrett-type water separator and a condenser are attached to the flask, and the mixture is heated briskly under reflux until water ceases to be collected in the trap (7–12 hours).
A. N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-methionine methyl ester (2). A 3-L, three-necked, Morton flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a dropping funnel is charged with L-methionine methyl ester hydrochloride (117.6 g, 0.56 mol), potassium bicarbonate (282.3 g, 2.82 mol, 500 mol %), water (750 mL), and ether (750 mL), and the solution is cooled to 0°C. Benzyl chloroformate (105 g, 88.6 mL, 0.62 mol, 110 mol %, Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.) is added dropwise over 1 hr, the cooling bath is removed, and the solution is stirred for 5 hr. Glycine (8.5 g, 0.11 mol, 20 mol %, Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.) is added (to scavenge excess chloroformate) and the solution is stirred for an additional 18 hr. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 0.01 M hydrochloric acid (2 × 500 mL), water (2 × 500 mL), and saturated brine (500 mL), and then dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil is further dried in a Kugelrohr oven (50°C, 0.1 mm, 12 hr) to leave product 2 as a clear oil that solidifies upon cooling: 165–166 g (98–99%), mp 42–43°C.
(C) Thymoquinone.—The wet aminothymol thus prepared is immediately dissolved in 110 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid diluted to 4 l. and contained in a 12-l. flask. To this solution is added 150 g. (2.08 moles) of sodium nitrite, in 5–10 g. portions, with shaking after each addition. The resulting mixture is heated to 60° on a steam bath, with occasional shaking, for one-half hour, and is then distilled in a current of steam, by means of the apparatus described on p. 479. All the thymoquinone passes over with the first 3 l. of distillate; it solidifies on cooling, and is filtered with suction, washed, and dried at room temperature. The yield is 80–87 g. (73–80 per cent of the theoretical amount) of bright yellow crystals, melting at 43–45°.
The flask is cooled with a stream of water while a solution of 100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water is added slowly and cautiously. The acidified mixture is heated under reflux for 15 minutes, allowed to cool, and the layers are separated. The crude product is diluted with 100 ml. of ether and washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and with 100 ml. of water containing 5 ml. of acetic acid. The ethereal solution, after drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, is distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. The product boiling at 84–86°/9 mm. is 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one; the yield is 155–165 g. (52–55%).
One mole of benzylmagnesium chloride is prepared in a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask from 24.3 g. (1 gram atom) of magnesium turnings, 126.5 g. (115 cc., 1 mole) of benzyl chloride, and 500 cc. of anhydrous ether, according to the directions given in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 471.
The flask contents are transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with 100 mL of water, 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solvent is removed by rotary evaporator and the solid residue is triturated with three portions of cold (0-5°C) methanol (50 mL, then 20 mL twice). The insoluble product is filtered, air dried, and recrystallized from acetone to give as the first crop 3.0-3.4 g of the pure anti isomer, mp (dec) > 250°C. Additional crystallizations bring the yield to 4.6 g (22%).
B. 5-Methyl-1-phenyl-6-hepten-3-ol (2).3 An oven-dried, 300-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, an air condenser (fitted with a three-way stopcock connected to a nitrogen balloon), and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with Ni(acac)2 (192 mg, 0.75 mmol). The apparatus is purged with nitrogen and the flask is charged with freshly distilled THF (100 mL). Diethylzinc (0.75 mL, 1 M hexane solution; 0.75 mmol) is added into this solution at ambient temperature. The color of the reaction mixture changes from yellow-green to brown. Isoprene (7.5 mL, 75 mmol) and dihydrocinnamaldehyde (3.4 g, 25 mmol) are added by syringe. Triethylborane (60 mL, 1 M hexane solution; 60 mmol) is then added via syringe over 5 min while stirring the solution with a magnetic stirrer. Stirring is continued for 8 h at ambient temperature. After the reaction is complete, most of the solvents and the remaining reagents (isoprene and Et3B) are removed with a rotary evaporator. The residual solution is diluted with diethyl ether (60 mL). The organic phase is washed with 4 M KOH (2 × 40 mL) and brine (2 × 30 mL), and then dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is distilled by means of Kugelrohr apparatus under reduced pressure (100–120 °C/0.03 mmHg) to give 5-methyl-1-phenyl-6-hepten-3-ol (2) (3.50–3.59 g, 68–70%) consisting of the anti- and syn-isomers in a ratio of 30:1.
When this test has been found to be satisfactory, the flask is allowed to cool to 90–95°, and the product is dissolved in 400 cc. of boiling alcohol. The solution is filtered from insoluble matter and allowed to cool. The yellow crystals of benzalphthalide are filtered with suction and washed with 40–50 cc. of cold alcohol. The product weighs 115–116 g. and melts at 95–97°; for purification it is recrystallized from 370–380 cc. of alcohol. The yield of pure benzalphthalide, m.p. 100–101°, is 106–110 g. (71–74 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 2,6-Dichloroaniline. The crude 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide is added to 200–250 ml. (5 ml./g.) of 70% sulfuric acid (50 ml. of concentrated acid diluted with 31 ml. of water) in a 500-ml. flask, and the mixture is boiled gently for 2 hours; heat is supplied by an oil bath kept at 165–195°. The dark mixture is then poured into 1 l. of water in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, whereupon partial separation of a suspension of black oil occurs. The flask is attached to a condenser by a gooseneck of glass tubing; the tubing entering the flask is bent at a slight angle and cut so that its opening is at right angles to the level of the solution. The product is steam-distilled by boiling the mixture with a free flame; the collecting vessel should be immersed in an ice bath. The solid product is separated from the distillate and dried in the air; the white 2,6-dichloroaniline weighs 23.5–26 g. (75–80% based on 3,5-dichlorosulfanilamide or 50–55% based on sulfanilamide) and melts at 39–40°. If the product is colored it can be purified by a second steam distillation; recovery is over 90%.
B. G1-[N(CH2CH2CH2NHBoc)2]6-Piperidine3. In a 4-L, 4-necked, jacketed reaction vessel equipped with a temperature probe, static N2 inlet, glass stopper and mechanical stirrer, G1-[N(CH2CH2CH2NHBoc)2]6-Cl3 (74.8 g, 43.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is suspended in acetone (3 L) and left to stir at 0 °C for 1 h. Piperidine (79.3 mL, 68.4 g, 803 mmol, 18.5 equiv) is added in a single portion and the mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 4 h. A white suspension started to form after 30 min. The mixture is warmed to 21 °C and stirred for an additional 20 h, at which time the reaction was judged to be complete by HPLC. The resulting suspension is filtered, washed with acetone (100 mL), and air dried overnight to afford 97.3 g of a white solid. The white solid is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (1000 mL), transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and washed with a 5% HCl solution (4 × 300 mL), 5% NaOH solution (1 × 300 mL), and a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium chloride (1 × 300 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate (108 g) and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 30 °C to afford an off-white solid that is dried in a vacuum oven for 96 h to provide 67.4 g of the title product (86% yield over two steps).
For the hydrolysis, 36 g. (0.11 mole) of the residue is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, and 210 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 190 ml. of water is added. The mixture is refluxed gently at first, then vigorously, until hydrolysis is essentially complete (about 20 hours). Then 180 ml. of water and 4 g. of Norit A are added and the mixture is stirred and boiled for 3 minutes, after which it is rapidly filtered with suction through two layers of hardened filter paper in a Büchner funnel. The filtrate, upon cooling to 20° or below, deposits 18 g. (72%) of lightly colored 2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzenediacetic acid. A snow-white product is obtained by dissolving 18 g. of this material in 375 ml. of boiling water, treating with 2 g. of Norit A, and filtering. Upon cooling, there is deposited 15 g. (61%) of the acid which melts at 233°.
In a 5-l. flask is placed 612 g. (12.5 moles) of finely powdered sodium cyanide (passed through a meat grinder and then sifted through a 20-mesh sieve); the flask is equipped with a thermometer in a well, an efficient stirrer, and a reflux condenser. The whole vessel is then set in a water bath into which warm and cold water can be run at will and if necessary rapidly removed.
C. Methyl 4-(5-methoxy-2-nitrophenyl)-3-oxobutyrate, 4. A 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an inert gas inlet, and a stopper is charged with 25.2 g (0.08 mol) of 3 in 200 mL of reagent grade methanol followed by 20 mL of ammonium hydroxide. The beige suspension turns red as soon as ammonium hydroxide is added. After about 15 min a white solid precipitates. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min, filtered and the solid is washed with 10–15 mL of cold methanol. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue is collected on a filter. This procedure is repeated once more. After three filtrations the combined solid weighs 16.3–17.4 g (75–80%), which is suitable for use in the next step. Recrystallization from methanol gives a colorless product.
The combined ether layer and extracts are transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer,3 a dropping funnel, a Claisen head with a water-cooled condenser, an electric heating mantle, and an ice-cooled receiver. After approximately one-half of the ether has been removed by distillation from the stirred mixture, 1.5 l. of distilled water is added slowly while the distillation is continued until a head temperature of 100° is reached.
To the cooled reaction mixture are added 25–30 g. (roughly 1.5 times the theoretical 0.112 mole) of sodium or potassium iodide and 30 ml. of glacial acetic acid. After the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. The released iodine is reduced with 10% sodium thiosulfate solution, after which the reaction mixture is placed immediately under an air blast. As the methanol evaporates, the product begins to crystallize. The crystallization should be well advanced by the time most of the methanol has evaporated. Water is then added, and the solid is removed by filtration and dried. The yield of crude product, softening at about 54° and melting at 59–62°, is 9.2–11.4 g. (78–96%). The crude product may be recrystallized by dissolving it in the minimal amount (40–50 ml.) of dry ether and slowly adding about 150 ml. of ligroin. Small crystals separate halfway through the addition, and crystallization is completed by cooling the mixture in an acetone-Dry Ice bath. An 80–90% recovery of pale yellow crystals melting at 62–63° is obtained. A second recrystallization from 70% aqueous ethanol gives nearly colorless crystals melting at 62.5–63.5°.
A. N-(2-Benzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)oxalamic acid ethyl ester . A two-necked, round-bottomed flask (500 mL) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a gas inlet, and a dropping funnel is purged with argon. The flask is charged with 2-amino-5-chlorobenzophenone (13.9 g, 60 mmol,), dichloromethane (100 mL), and pyridine (20 mL ,). A solution of ethyl oxalyl chloride (9.6 g, 70.3 mmol,) in dichloromethane (20 mL) is added dropwise through the addition funnel over a period of 45 min at 0°C (ice bath), and the resulting suspension is stirred for another 1.5 hr at ambient temperature. An aqueous saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (40 mL) is added dropwise, and the biphasic system is stirred for 1.5 hr until evolution of gas ceases. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (50 mL), dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated. The residual pyridine is removed by azeotropic distillation with toluene (3 × 100 mL) under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is dried under vacuum (10−3 mm) to afford N-(2-benzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)oxalamic acid ethyl ester (19.6 g, 98%), that is directly used in the next step,.
C. 7-Indolinecarboxaldehyde. A 300-mL Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 150 mL of concentrated (36%) hydrochloric acid. To this magnetically stirred solution, 19.8 g (0.08 mol) of finely powdered 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-7-indolinecarboxaldehyde is added portionwise over 15 min at room temperature. The starting material gradually dissolves accompanied by gas evolution. After 2 hr, the resulting orange-colored solution is poured into a 2-L beaker containing crushed ice (500 g). To this mixture, 120 mL of 28% aqueous ammonia solution is added slowly with stirring, and the resulting mixture containing a yellow precipitate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with four 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting yellowish brown oil is passed through 300 g of silica gel packed in an 8-cm diameter glass column using a mixture of toluene and ethyl acetate (30:1) as an eluent. The yellow eluates are combined, and the solvent is removed to give pure 7-indolinecarboxaldehyde (10.6–11.2 g, 90–95% yield) as a yellow solid, mp 48.5–49°C.
The crude p-acetaminobenzenesulfonyl chloride (p. 8) obtained from 67.5 g. (0.5 mole) of acetanilide is shaken for two hours with a solution of 252 g. (1 mole) of crystallized sodium sulfite (Na2SO3 · 7H2O) in 500 cc. of water. The reaction mixture is kept slightly alkaline by the addition at intervals of small portions of 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The total volume of alkali used varies from 10 to 50 cc. After the alkaline mixture has been shaken for the two-hour period it is filtered, and the filtrate is acidified with 60 per cent sulfuric acid. If the acid is added slowly, the sulfinic acid comes down in fine crystals which, after filtering and drying, melt at 155° with decomposition. The yield is 50–55 g.. (43–47 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the acetanilide used).
A. N-Bromomethylphthalimide (2). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 50.0 g (0.28 mol) of N-hydroxymethylphthalimide and 200 mL of 48% aqueous hydrobromic acid. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 75 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid is added with stirring over a period of about 15 min. On completion of the addition, the flask is removed from the ice bath, heated at 60–70°C for 5 hr, and then cooled overnight in a refrigerator. The solid is collected by suction filtration using a 125-mm glass funnel with a coarse frit. The crude product is washed thoroughly with three 100-mL portions of cold water, two 50-mL portions of cold 10% aqueous ammonium hydroxide, and finally with three 100-mL portions of cold water. The crude product thus obtained is completely dried under reduced pressure at room temperature over phosphorus pentoxide to give 57.1–63.8 g (85–95%) of N-bromomethylphthalimide as a light-tan solid, mp 142–147°C. Although the material thus obtained may be used in the next step without further purification, it may also be recrystallized from dry acetone, mp 147–148°C (lit. mp 148°C,2 148–149°C3).
E. 1-Amino-2-phenylaziridine. If the pentane solution from Step D is removed on a rotary evaporator at room temperature, 7.5–7.7 g.. (82–85%) of 1-amino-2-phenylaziridine, suitable for preparative use, is obtained. Kügelrohr distillation of this material on a 1–2 g. scale (0.01 mm./60–65° oven temperature) gives a recovery of over 90% and.
The crude acid is purified by dissolving in 360–400 ml. of cold 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, filtering, and acidifying the filtrate with sufficient excess of mineral acid to turn Congo red paper blue. The product is separated by suction filtration, washed with water to remove mineral acid, and air-dried. Material thus obtained weighs 17.9–18.7 g. (67–70% yield). It melts generally between 202° and 205°, and is sufficiently pure for most practical purposes.
Wiberg and Waddell also noted that propellane reacts with iodine in 88% yield.2 Alber and Szeimies report a somewhat lower yield (61%) when an ethereal solution of propellane is treated with a solution of iodine in ether/pentane while being irradiated.3 Thus, titration of a portion of the resulting propellane solution with iodine provides an estimate of the minimum yield. A 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred as noted above. Small pieces of iodine are added with stirring under room light over 10 min until just before the dark color persists. Concentration of the solution provides 1,3-diiodobicyclo[1.1.1]pentane from which the minimal concentration of the propellane solution and minimal yield of propellane may be estimated if iodine is not added in excess. Alternatively, a solution of iodine in diethyl ether/pentane may be added instead of neat iodine.
A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a Hershberg stirrer operating in a ground-glass bearing, a 250-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a coil condenser. The exit from the condenser is connected to a train consisting of a trap (of at least 50-ml. capacity below the bottom of the inlet tube) cooled in ice, a drying tube (about 6 in. long by 1 in. I.D.) filled with indicating Drierite and calcium chloride, an efficient trap of at least 150-ml. capacity cooled in Dry Ice-acetone to −70° or below, and a drying tube containing Drierite. A mixture of 95% ethanol (400 ml.), water (80 ml.), and 300 g. (4.6 g. atoms) of zinc dust is placed in the reaction flask. The addition funnel is charged with 260 g. (2.34 moles) of 2,3-dichloropropene, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated to reflux, and the 2,3-dichloropropene is added dropwise at such a rate that reflux is maintained without external heating (2–3 hours). After the addition is complete, heating is resumed for 1 hour. The ice-cooled trap is warmed to about 25°, and the residual allene is purged from the reaction flask with a very slow stream of nitrogen.
The mixture of alcohols is placed in a 1000-mL round-bottomed flask, dissolved in 300 mL of ether, and cooled to 0°C. To this solution is added via an addition funnel over a 30-min period a mixture of sodium dichromate dihydrate (27.5 g, 0.092 mol), 100 mL of water, and 10.2 mL of concd sulfuric acid. The mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr, warmed to room temperature where stirring is maintained overnight, diluted with 200 mL of water, and poured into a separatory funnel. The layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL) and brine (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to give 16.8–17.8 g (61–65%) of verbenone. Final purification is achieved by distillation of the oil through a 5-in Vigreux column at reduced pressure (dry ice-acetone cooled receiver); 13.1 g (47%), bp 108–110°C (5 mm).
B. 1-Fluoroadamantane (2). A 250-ml., polyolefin bottle is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a polyolefin drying tube inserted through a hole in the cap and sealed with Teflon tape. The bottle is charged with 5.0 g. (0.033 mole) of 1-adamantanol and 50 ml. of pyridinium polyhydrogen fluoride (1). The solution is allowed to stir for 3 hours at ambient temperature, after which 150 ml. of petroleum ether is added, and stirring is continued for another 15 minutes. The resulting two-phase solution is transferred to a 250-ml., polyolefin separatory funnel, and the bottom layer is discarded. The organic layer is washed successively with 50 ml. of water, 50 ml. of a saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 50 ml. of water, then dried over magnesium sulfate. After the organic layer is filtered, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, yielding 4.5–4.6 g. (88–90%) of adamantane 2 as a white powder, m.p. 225–227° (sublimes in a sealed capillary), which can be purified by vacuum sublimation or by recrystallization from methanol-carbon tetrachloride.
After all the bromine has been added, stirring is continued for 4–5 minutes longer and the dibromide is collected by filtration on an 11-cm. Büchner funnel, using suction. The product is washed with 100 ml. of warm 75% ethanol. The crude product is purified by dissolving in the minimum amount of boiling methanol (800–1000 ml.) and cooling the solution in an ice bath for 4 hours. The product is collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator in the absence of light for 24 hours. The yield amounts to 110–120 g. (52–57%) of white needles which melt at 124–125°.
A 500-mL, four-necked, reaction flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and glass pH electrode combined with an automatic titrator, is charged with sodium (meta)periodate (85.5 g, 0.4 mol) and water (200 mL). The suspension is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath and 3 N sodium hydroxide (about 133 mL, 0.4 mol) is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature does not exceed 7°C. The final pH of the suspension is 5.5. The cooling bath is removed and finely powdered 5,6-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono-1,4-lactone (43.6 g, 0.2 mol) is added in one portion. The temperature of the mixture is kept below 30°C. The pH of the suspension is maintained at 5.5 during the course of the reaction by addition of aqueous 15% sodium carbonate (about 15 mL). The suspension is further stirred at room temperature for 30 min, saturated with sodium chloride (105 g), and filtered by suction using a Büchner funnel. The white solid is washed thoroughly with two 50-mL portions of brine and the pH of the combined aqueous layers is adjusted to 6.7 with aqueous 15% sodium carbonate before extraction with dichloromethane (6 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate (25 g). The magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with two 50-mL portions of dichloromethane. The organic solutions are combined and slowly concentrated to about 50 mL under reduced pressure. The remaining solution is placed in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a 10-cm, vacuum-jacketed, Claisen-Vigreux column (10-mm diameter). With constant stirring by a magnetic stirrer, the solution is further concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure (400 mbar) at 35°C (bath temperature). The temperature of the oil bath is then gradually increased to 80°C and the glyceraldehyde acetonide is distilled between 51°C and 52°C. The distillate is collected in a receiver cooled with an ice-methanol bath. Approximately 14.5 g of L-(S)-glyceraldehyde acetonide (56% based on 5,6-O-isopropylidene-L-gulono-1,4-lactone) is obtained.
The combined filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure in a 500-ml. filter flask until most of the solution is filled with crystals. The mixture is warmed to dissolve the crystals, the solution is poured into a 600-ml. beaker, and an equal volume of absolute ether and a similar volume of ligroin are added. The resulting solution is cooled in a freezing mixture with gentle stirring. The crystals of the tetraacetate form quickly and after about 10 minutes are filtered and air-dried. The crystals so obtained melt at 132–134°. If a purer product is required, the product is dissolved in acetone, and ether and ligroin are added to the solution in the manner described. The yield of once-crystallized product melting at 132–134° is 52–56 g. (75–80%).
In a 300-ml. Claisen flask, whose side neck is elongated by a 10-cm. indented section, 102 g. (1 mole) of acetic anhydride and 0.1 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid are mixed by hand swirling. The mixture is cooled to 10° by swirling in an ice bath, then there is added, during about 10 minutes, 96 g. (1 mole) of recently distilled furfural. The temperature is maintained at 10–20°. After addition is complete and the contents of the flask have been well mixed by swirling, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction allowed to warm up spontaneously. A maximum temperature of about 35° is usually reached in about 5 minutes. After the temperature has dropped to that of the room (20–30 minutes), 0.4 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate is added, the flask is fitted for distillation at reduced pressure, and the mixture is distilled from an oil bath. A fore-run, weighing 50–70 g. and consisting principally of a mixture of acetic anhydride, furfural, and furfural diacetate, is collected at 50–140°/20 mm.. The product, collected at 140–142°/20 mm., weighs 129–139 g. (65–70%) and melts at 52–53° and.
The alkaline solution is cooled to room temperature; with the stirrer still in constant operation, and after inserting a thermometer, 160 g. (1 mole) of bromine is added from a dropping funnel in the course of twenty to thirty minutes. During this operation the temperature is allowed to rise to 40–50°. Stirring is continued for one-half hour after all the bromine has been added. The solution should still be alkaline and should contain only a small amount of suspended material.
If a purer product is desired, it is recrystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°), using 4 ml. per 3 g., and drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is chilled to 0° and the ester filtered on a chilled funnel; the recovery is 90%, and the melting point is 28–30°. Evaporation of the solvent to a small volume deposits an additional amount.
A. Methyl N,N-dichlorocarbamate. A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a gas inlet, and a gas outlet is charged with 84 g (1.1 mol) of methyl carbamate, 210 g (2.6 mol) of sodium acetate, 21 g (0.35 mol) of glacial acetic acid, and 400 mL of water and cooled to −10 to −15°C. About 175 g (2.5 mol) of chlorine is condensed in a calibrated Schlenk tube cooled with dry ice–methanol. The cooling bath is replaced by an ice–water bath and chlorine is passed slowly (over 2 hr,) at a constant rate into the solution, which is vigorously stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the yellow oil which settles is run off. The yellow oil is washed with three subsequent 50-mL portions of a 20% aqueous sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The crude product is then transferred to a distillation apparatus, where it is kept under reduced pressure (11–15 mm) at room temperature for about 20 min. The bath temperature is slowly raised to a maximum of 60°C. The product distills at 43°C (11 mm) to give 102–118 g (63–73%, based on methyl carbamate) of a heavy yellow oil ((Note 6),,).
While the reaction is aging at 0° to +5°C, a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for mechanical stirring, and outfitted with a rubber septum, and a Claisen adapter bearing a thermometer and a nitrogen inlet/outlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 117 mL of 6% aqueous ammonium chloride (7.0 g diluted to 117 mL). The solution is chilled to 1 to 2°C, with efficient mechanical stirring. When the formation of dimethyltitanocene is judged to be complete, the toluene /THF reaction mixture is quenched into the well-stirred aqueous ammonium chloride solution via a cannula over a period of 1 hr, maintaining an internal temperature of 0° to +5°C in both flasks. Toluene (30 mL) is used to rinse the reaction flask. The biphasic mixture is then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel, with another 30 mL of toluene rinse, and the aqueous phase is separated. The organic layer is washed sequentially with three portions of cold water (100 mL each) and brine (100 mL), then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 35 g). The organic layer is filtered and carefully concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of no more than 35°C to a weight of 150 g. The resulting orange solution is assayed by 1H NMR to be 20 weight percent dimethyltitanocene (29.55 g, 85.0%). If the solution is to be stored for more than a week, the reagent should be diluted with 160 mL of dry THF, which has a stabilizing effect on the labile reagent. The solution is stored at 0° to 10°C under nitrogen in a rubber septum-sealed, round-bottomed flask. It proved effective in the conversion of a complex ester to an enol ether.
While stirring is continued, the aqueous distilland is cooled in an ice bath. The benzeneboronic acid, which separates as small white crystals, is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with petroleum ether. The petroleum ether removes traces of dibenzeneborinic acid, which are seen in the hot mother liquor as globules of brown oil and which may color the product. The acid is dehydrated to benzeneboronic anhydride by heating it in an oven at 110° and atmospheric pressure for 6 hours. Benzeneboronic anhydride is obtained as a colorless solid, weight 240–247 g. (77–79%), m.p. 214–216°.
A. 3-Pentanone SAMP hydrazone [(S)-2]. A 50-mL, one-necked, pear-snapped, flask equipped with a 10-cm Liebig condenser, a gas inlet tube, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 3.9 g (3.0 mmol) of SAMP and 3.79 mL (36 mmol) of 3-pentanone and the mixture is warmed at 60°C under argon overnight. The crude product is diluted with 200 mL of ether in a 250-mL separatory funnel and washed with 30 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification by short-path distillation yields 5.18 g (87%) of a colorless oil, bp 70–75°C at 0.5 mm, [α]D20 +297° (benzene, c = 1). The SAMP-hydrazone (S)-2 should be stored in a refrigerator under argon.
D. (R)-3-Butyn-2-yl methanesulfonate . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 713 mL) and (R)-(+)-3-butyn-2-ol (10.00 g, 143 mmol). The mixture is cooled to −78°C and triethylamine (Et3N, 39.7 mL, 285 mmol) and methanesulfonyl chloride (16.6 mL, 214 mmol) are added. The resulting mixture is stirred at −78°C for 1 hr, then quenched with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution and allowed to warm to room temperature. The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with brine and concentrated under aspirator pressure. The residue is diluted with 500 mL of ether and washed with water (20 mL) followed by brine (20 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (50 mL). The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated under aspirator pressure to yield 20.13 g (95%) of the methanesulfonate. The material is used without further purification.
A. Lithium triethylcarboxide (Solution 1). A thoroughly dried, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a septum inlet with serum cap, a reflux condenser, and a magnetic stirrer is purged with and maintained under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. After a solution of 300 ml. of 1.67 M n-butyllithium (0.500 mole) in hexane is introduced into the flask by syringe and cooled to 0° in an ice bath, 58 g. (0.50 mole) of 3-ethyl-3-pentanol is added slowly, but constantly, by syringe. At the end of addition the yellow tint of the n-butyllithium solution disappears. The alkoxide solution is standardized by hydrolysis of aliquots in water and by titration of the resulting lithium hydroxide with standard acid to a phenolphthalein end point.
B. 3-Deoxy-1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-ribo-hexofuranose. A dry, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser to which a nitrogen inlet is attached. The apparatus is charged with 500 mL of anhydrous toluene, 24.7 g (0.085 mol) of tributyltin hydride and 19.25 g (0.055 mol) of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-3-O-(S-methyldithiocarbonate)-α-D-glucofuranose. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere until TLC analysis indicates the disappearance of starting materials (4–7 hr). During this time the reaction solution changes from deep yellow to nearly colorless. The toluene is removed on a rotary evaporator to yield a thick, oily residue that is partitioned between 250-mL portions of petroleum ether and acetonitrile. The acetonitrile layer is separated and washed with three 100-mL portions of petroleum ether and is then concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow oil is taken up in hexane-ethyl acetate (10 : 1) and filtered through a pad of silica gel. The filtrate is concentrated and the residual oil is distilled to give 10.0 g (75%) of product as a colorless syrup, bp 72–73°C (0.2 mm); nD25 1.4474.
B1. 1-Acetoxy-4-diethylamino-2-butene. Method 1. In a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and a rubber septum, is placed 2.77 g (2.4 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium, Pd(PPh3)4. The flask is closed, evacuated, and filled with nitrogen. This flushing procedure is repeated twice. A solution of 8.91 g (0.06 mol) of the chloroacetate from Procedure A in 180 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added through the membrane with the aid of a 50-mL syringe. With the same syringe 21.9 g (0.30 mol) of diethylamine in 120 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added. The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and the reaction is followed by gas chromatography. When the starting material has been consumed, which takes approximately 4 hr, 600 mL of ice-cooled ether and 600 mL of ice-cooled saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution are added and the mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted with ether ( 2 × 300 mL).
B. 3,4,8,9-Tetrabromo-11-oxatricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undecane. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 59.2 g. (0.400 mole) of 11-oxatricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undeca-3,8-diene and 500 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The resulting solution is cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath, and 120 g. (0.75 mole) of bromine is added with stirring over a period of 1.5 hours. After the addition is complete, the ether is removed on a rotary evaporator. The solid residue is dissolved in 800 ml. of hot chloroform. To this solution is added, with gentle stirring, 150 ml. of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90°). The resulting, clear mixture, from which the product begins to crystallize, is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stand in a refrigerator at −40° overnight, completing the crystallization. The yield of white crystalline tetrabromide obtained is 115–125 g. (61–67%), m.p. 151–153°. An additional 18–25 g. of product, m.p. 149–152°, is recovered from the mother liquor by concentration to about one quarter of the volume, giving a total yield of 136–144 g. (73–77%) of material sufficiently pure to be used in the following step.
At the conclusion of the reaction period, 100 ml. of water is added at a temperature below 15°. The aqueous layer is separated and the reaction flask and organic layer are washed with a mixture of 50 ml. of water and 75 ml. of diethyl ether. The aqueous layers are combined, back-extracted with 50 ml. of ether, and acidified to Congo red with 6 N hydrochloric acid. The product is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether, washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated. The remaining traces of solvent may be removed in a rotary evaporator, yielding 12–12.8 g. (83–90%) of crude 2,2-dimethyl-4-phenylbutyric acid, m.p. 89–94°, which is suitable for many purposes. Recrystallization from 75 ml. of hexane at room temperature followed by refrigeration yields 8.4–9.7 g. (58–67%) of product as colorless needles, m.p. 98–99.5°. Recrystallization of the filtrate residue from 20 ml. of hexane yields a small second crop, 1.2–1.6 g. (8–11%), m.p. 95–97°. The combined yield totals 10–11 g. (70–76%).
Magnesium (2.88 g, 0.12 mol), 300 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and 10 mg of iodine are placed in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing tube, and a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen flow line. Nitrogen is passed through the solvent for 15 min and a constant flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the reaction. A solution of 14.06 g (0.1 mol) of (2-chloroethyl)benzene in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is placed in the dropping funnel. About 2 mL of this solution is added to the reaction mixture and the reaction is initiated by gently heating the flask (with a heat gun). Once the reaction has started, as evidenced by the disappearance of iodine color, the rest of the (2-chloroethyl)benzene solution is added dropwise at such a rate that a gentle reflux is maintained throughout the addition. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 1 hr at 23°C, followed by heating at reflux for 8 hr. The reaction vessel is cooled to 0°C and a solution of 13.56 g (0.12 mol) of N-formylpiperidine in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise. The mixture is brought to 23°C and stirred for another 15 min.
A solution of 147 g. (1.50 moles) of cyclohexanone, 157 g. (1.80 moles) of morpholine, and 1.5 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid in 300 ml. of toluene is heated to boiling in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask to which is attached a water separator2 under a reflux condenser. The separation of water begins at once and ceases after 4 or 5 hours. An indented Claisen stillhead is attached to the flask, and the reaction mixture is distilled. Most of the toluene is removed at atmospheric pressure. 1-Morpholino-1-cyclohexene is collected as a colorless liquid at 118–120°/10 mm.; nD25 1.5122–1.5129. It weighs 180–200 g. (72–80%).
To 3 l. (approximately 45 moles) of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.9) in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is added, with shaking, a solution of 95 g. (1 mole) of chloroacetic acid in 100 cc. of water. The flask is stoppered and allowed to stand for four days. It is then attached to a condenser for distillation, and the solution is concentrated to 600–700 cc. The excess ammonia is recovered during this process by connecting the lower end of the condenser to a wide tube leading to the bottom of a 3-l. bottle containing 1.5 l. of distilled water and connecting this in the same way with a smaller bottle containing a little water. The bottles are cooled by running water. About 2 l. of 20–23 per cent ammonium hydroxide is recovered in the first receiver.
In a 200-ml. flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 20 g. (0.082 mole) of 1,1'-azo-bis-1-cyclohexanenitrile (p. 66) and 50 ml. of toluene. The solution is heated under gentle reflux for 8 hours, and the reaction mixture is placed in a refrigerator overnight. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel and air-dried; yield 11.5–12.2 g. (65–69%); m.p. 224.5–225.5°.
The reaction mixture is poured into a separatory funnel and diluted with an equal volume of water. The benzalpinacolone is separated by extracting three times with 300-cc. portions of benzene. The benzene extracts are combined and washed, first with water until the alkali is entirely removed, then with a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite, and finally two or three times with water. After drying over calcium chloride, the benzene is removed by distilling from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of distilled benzalpinacolone boiling at 143–146° /10 mm. is 165–175 g. (88–93 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is slightly yellow and melts at 41–42°. It is pure enough for most purposes. It may be recrystallized from 95 per cent alcohol and is then obtained in almost pure white crystals, melting at 43°.
A. Bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butanerhodium tri-fluoromethanesulfonate 1. A 250-mL, two necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a septum, two-way stopcock used as a gas inlet and outlet, and a magnetic stirrer, is charged with a solution of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene-2,4-pentanedionatorhodium (117.6 mg, 0.4 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (2.5 mL) under a gentle stream of argon. Trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (97.8 mg, 0.44 mmol) is added in one portion by microsyringe via the septum, resulting in a color change from yellow to orange. Solid 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (170.4 mg, 0.4 mmol) is added all at once, with removal and immediate replacement of the septum cap. The color of the solution darkens to a deep orange-red, and precipitation of an orange solid occurs over 1–2 min. Dry 30–40 petroleum ether (10 mL) is added with vigorous stirring. The mixture is allowed to settle, and the solvent is removed first by syringe and finally under reduced pressure with an oil pump. Argon is admitted and the catalyst is dried and stored under argon and.
In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled by an ice-salt mixture, are placed 300 cc. of ether and 186 g. (2 moles) of a 33 per cent aqueous methylamine solution. When the stirred mixture has cooled to 5°, 217 g. (2 moles) of ethyl chloroformate is added without allowing the temperature to rise above 5°. When almost half of the chloroformate has been added a cold solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of pure sodium hydroxide in 120 cc. of water is added gradually along with the rest of the chloroformate at such a rate that the last portions of the two solutions are added simultaneously. Constant mechanical stirring throughout the addition is essential. After standing for fifteen minutes, the ether layer is separated and the aqueous solution is extracted with 100 cc. of ether. The combined ether layers are rapidly dried by shaking for a short time with about 8 g. of potassium carbonate in two portions. The ether is then distilled and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, the distillate being collected at 55–60°/12 mm. The yield of colorless oil is 182–185 g. (88–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Without purification, the mixture of acetates is placed in a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask and 150 mL of a 10% potassium hydroxide solution in aqueous methanol is introduced at room temperature. After 24 hr of stirring, the brown mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, diluted with 200 mL of water, and extracted with four 150-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal fractions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to give a mixture of alcohols as a light yellow oil.
C. Acid-catalyzed epimerization. The combined mother liquors from Step B are concentrated to dryness, dissolved in 50 mL of benzene, and concentrated again under reduced pressure. The resulting solid is dissolved in 150 mL of dichloromethane, treated with D-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid (2.0 g, 8.6 mmol) and the mixture is heated to reflux under argon with magnetic stirring for 19 hr. The resulting solution is cooled to 0°C and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (40 mL) is carefully added. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 20°C. The organic phase is separated and washed with two 50-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is crystallized three times from petroleum ether as described in Step B to give an additional 13.04-17.60 g (17-22%) of furanone. The total yield of pure (5S)-(d-menthyloxy)-2(5H)-furanone (based on the menthol used in Step B) is 24.75-34.93 g (32-44%).
A. N,N-Dimethylformamide-dimethyl sulfate complex. In a 500-ml. four-necked flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with calcium chloride drying tube, dropping funnel, and thermometer is placed 73 g. (1.0 mole) of dimethylformamide, and 126 g. (1.0 mole) of dimethyl sulfate is added dropwise with stirring at 50–60°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated for another 2 hours at 70–80°. The dimethylformamide complex forms as a viscous, colorless or pale yellow ether-insoluble oil.
A. Ethyl (E)-2-cyano-6-octenoate. A solution of 38.4 g. (0.384 mole) of (E)-4-hexen-1-ol in 160 ml. of anhydrous pyridine is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. Over 1 hour, 91.5 g. (0.478 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added portionwise and with stirring to the reaction mixture while maintaining the temperature at 0–5°. The resulting slurry is allowed to stand overnight in a refrigerator, then poured into 500 g. of an ice-water mixture. The reaction mixture is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are washed successively with four 150-ml. portions of 2 N sulfuric acid, 50 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and two 50-ml. portions of water. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the solvent removed on a rotary evaporator at 25°, yielding 76–88 g. (78–91%) of crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate as a pale yellow oil.
A. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methylene-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 102.6 g (500 mmol) of 6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline and 150 mL of alcohol-free chloroform. The mixture is warmed to 50°C with stirring. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 136.9 g (627 mmol) of di-tert-butyl pyrocarbonate in 50 mL of alcohol-free chloroform. The nitrogen is turned off, and the solution of di-tert-butyl pyrocarbonate is added to the mixture at such a rate as to maintain steady but controlled gas evolution. The stirred reaction mixture is heated at 60–65°C until gas evolution ceases, then allowed to cool to room temperature with stirring.
B. [1,1-(Bis-benzyloxymethyl)vinyloxy]triethylsilane (3). An LDA solution is prepared in a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet and nitrogen balloon, magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum by adding BuLi (1.6 M solution in hexane, 22.5 mL, 36 mmol) into a solution containing diisopropylamine (5.1 mL, 36 mmol) in THF (36 mL) at −78 °C. The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min at room temperature. A separate two-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with two septa and a nitrogen balloon. Dibenzyl acetal 2 (8.1 g, 30 mmol) and chloro-triethylsilane (7.5 mL, 45 mmol) are dissolved in THF (30 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere. This mixture is cooled to −78 °C and the LDA solution is added by cannula over the course of 10 min. Triethylamine (18.8 mL, 135 mmol) was immediately added by syringe over the course of 10 min. The resulting reaction mixture is stirred for 16 h at −78 °C. Water (25 mL) is added, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred until it reaches room temperature. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with cyclohexane. After being dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) the organic solution is concentrated under vacuum and purified by column chromatography (6-cm diameter column, 360 g silica gel, MTBE/cyclohexane (1:100, 9 L) with 0.1% Et3N) to give 3 as a yellow oil (8.9 g, 77%).
B. 9-Bromophenanthrene. One kilogram (5.6 moles) of pure phenanthrene is dissolved in 1 l. of dry carbon tetrachloride in a 5-l. three-necked flask. A 500-ml. dropping funnel, a reflux condenser (with tube to conduct evolved hydrogen bromide to the hood), and an efficient motor-driven sealed stirrer are attached. The mixture is heated at gentle reflux with stirring, and 900 g. (5.64 moles) of bromine is added from the dropping funnel over a period of about 3 hours. After stirring at gentle reflux for 2 additional hours, during which most of the remaining hydrogen bromide is evolved, the reaction mixture is placed in a Claisen flask and the solvent is distilled at a pressure of 10–30 mm. The flask containing the residue is then provided with a fine capillary inlet tube, a thermometer, and a 2-l. distilling flask as receiver. The impure 9-bromophenanthrene is distilled, and the material boiling at 177–190°/2 mm. is collected. The yield is 1300–1360 g. (90–94%), m.p. 54–56° and.
The residual amine in the filtrate may be isolated in the form of the hydrochloride. The combined solutions are evaporated on a steam bath, 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and heating is continued for 2 hours. On cooling, the syrupy solution crystallizes. It is triturated with 50 ml. of ethanol, and the 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole hydrochloride is filtered, washed with a little ethanol, and dried. The yield of the hydrochloride is 10–18 g. (8–15%); the salt melts at 147–148° and may be recrystallized from 95% ethanol, using 10 ml. per gram; the melting point is thus raised to 151–152°.
The crude powdered sugar is purified by heating 200 g. of it for forty-five minutes on the boiling-water bath with 300 g. of glacial acetic acid,1 allowing to cool, filtering off the arabinose, washing it with 500 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in four portions, and drying at 50–60°. It then weighs about 182 g. and melts at 155–157°. It may be recrystallized from five times its weight of 76 per cent ethyl alcohol, with the use of 10 g. of decolorizing charcoal (Norite). The yield is about 127 g., and the melting point is 155–157°; the crystals are now perfectly colorless.
The sirupy filtrate from the dl-tartaric acid, which consists principally of meso-tartaric acid together with a small amount of unchanged d-tartaric acid, is diluted with its own volume of water and divided into two equal parts; one part is exactly neutralized with potassium hydroxide, using phenolphthalein, and the second part is added. After standing for twenty-four hours the potassium hydrogen d-tartrate is filtered off. The filtrate is neutralized with ammonia, then just acidified with acetic acid, and treated with an excess of calcium chloride solution (about 500 cc. of a 25 per cent solution). After standing for a week the precipitated calcium meso-tartrate is filtered and washed with cold distilled water. It may, if desired, be recrystallized from boiling water. The yield is 42–55 g. (corresponding to 13–17 per cent of the original d-tartaric acid). The sirupy free acid may be prepared from this salt by treatment with sulfuric acid as above.
The casein, which is contaminated with calcium phosphate and fats, is filtered to as small a volume as possible (about 500 cc.) and transferred to a 2-l. beaker. It is then treated with 0.1 M sodium hydroxide, the alkali being added slowly and with stirring through a capillary extending to the bottom of the beaker. The addition of alkali is continued until the pH of the mixture reaches 6.3; 100–150 cc. of the alkali is required. The end point is determined by matching against a buffered series, employing dibromo-o-cresolsulfonphthalein ("bromocresol purple"). At this pH the casein is completely in solution in the form of its sodium salt; fats, calcium phosphate, and any calcium caseinate remain undissolved. Care must be taken not to add more alkali than is necessary to bring the pH to the above point. The milky solution is filtered through a thick layer (10–15 mm.) of filter paper pulp tightly packed upon a suction funnel. The filtrate may be slightly opalescent; if it is less clear it is again filtered through a fresh layer of pulp.
B. Benzeneselenenyl chloride. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a gas-inlet tube, and a reflux condenser is charged with 50 g. (0.16 mole) of diphenyl diselenide and 350 ml. of hexane. The mixture is warmed to 40–50°, dissolving the solid. The resulting solution is stirred while chlorine gas is passed through the gas-inlet tube into the flask 1 cm. above the surface of the liquid, at a rate sufficient to maintain the temperature between 40° and 50°. Chlorination is continued until 11.3 g. (0.159 mole) of the gas is absorbed. The solution is heated to reflux, filtered by gravity, and allowed to cool slowly at room temperature, then at 6°. The mother liquor is decanted, the large, deep-orange crystals are washed with 25 ml. of pentane, and the residual solvent is evaporated by passing a slow stream of nitrogen over the crystals for 30 minutes, giving 51–54 g. (84–88%) of benzeneselenenyl chloride, m.p. 60–62°.
The same 5-l. flask used in the preceding step is used again, without washing; it is fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube, a sealed mechanical stirrer, and the dropping funnel containing the acid chloride. In the flask are placed 296 g. (4 moles) of dry t-butyl alcohol and 484 g. (4 moles) of dimethylaniline in 600 ml. of anhydrous ether. The acid chloride is added dropwise to the stirred solution, the mixture being cooled occasionally with an ice bath to prevent excessive refluxing. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours and then stirred gently at room temperature for 15 hours. Two liters of water is added with stirring, and the mixture is filtered with suction through a Büchner funnel fitted with a matting of glass wool. The matting is washed with three 250-ml. portions of ether. After separation of the combined ethereal layers, the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with successive portions of 2N sulfuric acid (a total of 1 l.) until free of dimethylaniline, then with two 200-ml. portions of 2N sodium carbonate solution, and dried over sodium carbonate. After removal of the ether by distillation, the residue is transferred to an alkali-washed flask and distilled at reduced pressure through a 20-cm. alkali-washed Vigreux column. The yield of colorless product is 355–378 g. (63–67%) boiling at 67–68°/1.5mm. (90°/10 mm., 54–56°/0.3 mm), nD20 = 1.4198.
B. (2SR,3RS)-2,4-Dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet is flushed with nitrogen, charged with 12.5 g (55 mmol) of periodic acid and 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and then sealed with a stoppered, 25-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The solution is stirred vigorously and cooled to 0–5°C with an ice–salt bath. During this time the addition funnel is charged with a solution of 12.0 g of 5-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-2-(trimethylsiloxy)heptan-3-one (10.8 g, 41 mmol of ketone from a 90 : 10 mixture from Part A) in 10 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, which is then rapidly introduced (1 min) to the cold, stirring solution. After the addition is complete 5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to the addition funnel to rinse the walls of the funnel, and the rinse is then added to the reaction solution. The cooling bath is removed after 15 min and stirring is continued for 1.5 hr, during which time a white precipitate forms. In the meantime, 52 g (0.5 mol) of sodium bisulfite is mixed with 100 mL of distilled water in a 500-mL filtering flask with a side hose connection and cooled to 0–5°C with an ice–salt bath. The reaction mixture is filtered directly through filter paper with suction into the cold slurry of sodium bisulfite. The residue is rinsed with 50 mL of dry ether, which is added to the filter funnel and drawn by suction into the yellow solution. After magnetic stirring of the cold mixture for 20 min the contents of the flask are introduced into a 500-mL separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer (pH 4.3) is extracted twice with 100 mL of ether and the combined yellow organic layer is washed with 125 mL of distilled water and separated (the pH of the wash is 2.6–3.5). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate for 1 hr and filtered to remove the drying agent, and the solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure. Distillation of the dark-yellow oil affords 4.9–5.4 g (82–89%) of (2SR,3RS)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid, bp 85–89°C (0.01 mm), as a viscous, yellow–green liquid. Crystallization from hexane using decolorizing carbon provides 4.6–5.0 g (77–83%) of pure hydroxy acid, mp 75–76°C, as white crystals.
N-(10-Undecenoyloxy)pyridine-2-thione (3) . To an oven-dried, one-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, a magnetic stirrer, and a dropping funnel are added 3.61 g (28.4 mmol) of N-hydroxythiopyridone (2), 6.20 g (30.0 mmol) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, and 40 mL of methylene chloride. The resulting homogeneous solution is cooled to 0°C and 4.99 g (27.1 mmol) of 10-undecenoic acid (1) is added dropwise. Following the addition of the undecenoic acid, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for a further 8 hr. The bright yellow suspension that results is filtered through a bed of silica gel. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give 8.06 g of the crude Barton ester (3) and.
The lithium tetramethylpiperidide solution from Part A is cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath. When the solution of ethyl 1-naphthoate and dibromomethane has cooled to −74°C or below (internal solution temperature), addition of the dry ice-acetone cooled solution of lithium tetramethylpiperidide is begun. Addition is made via a double-ended (16 gauge) needle over a 40 to 50-min period using a slight positive nitrogen pressure in the 500-mL flask. During this time, the addition rate is slowed or stopped as needed to maintain the reaction temperature below −67°C.
D. cis-N-Tosyl-3-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-3-ene. A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and reflux condenser is charged with 5.159 g (18.49 mmol) of cis-1-N-tosyl-2-(2-propenyl)cyclopentylamine, 1.998 g (18.49 mmol) of p-benzoquinone, 0.096 g (0.370 mmol, 2 mol%) of PdCl2 (CH3CN)2, 3.920 g (92.46 mmol, 500 mol%) of lithium chloride, and 1.960 g (18.49 mmol) of sodium carbonate. Tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) is added and stirring is begun. The yellow–orange solution is heated at reflux until thin-layer chromatography (3 : 1 hexane : ethyl acetate, SiO2) shows that no starting material remains (about 3–4 hr); it is then poured into a 500-mL separatory funnel and 100 mL of ethyl acetate is added. This is washed with 100-mL portions of 1 : 1 saturated aqueous sodium chloride : sodium hydroxide (1%) until the aqueous layer is clear; then the yellow–green organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (2 × 50 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered by gravity, and passed through a short column (approximately 5 cm) of neutral alumina, and the column is washed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined solvents are removed under reduced pressure to give 4.9–5.1 g (94–99%) of a tan solid. The product is recrystallized from 100 mL of methyl alcohol : water (4 : 1) to yield 4 (3.9–4.45 g, 76–87%) as white needles, mp 91–92°C and.
A. (1'R)-(−)-4,6-O-Ethylidene-D-glucose . A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with D-glucose (81.8 g, 454 mmol, Note 1) and paraldehyde (68.0 g, 514 mmol, Note 2). Concentrated sulfuric acid (0.5 mL) is added dropwise within 30 sec with shaking. The mixture is mechanically shaken for 40 min and then left for 3 days at room temperature. Ethanol (300 mL, Note 5) is added to the adhesive, colorless mass, then the pH is adjusted to 6.5-7 by addition of a 1 N solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol. The residue is dissolved by careful heating. During this procedure the pH is maintained constant by gradual addition of more 1 N ethanolic potassium hydroxide . Charcoal (5 g, Note 8) is added to the yellow solution and the mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel containing a 2-cm pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with hot ethanol (50 mL). The filtrate, on standing overnight in a freezer at −30°C, deposits a colorless solid material that is recrystallized from ethanol (90 mL) at −30°C to yield 39.4 g (42%) of (−)-4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose . The combined mother liquors are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30°C, 30 mm), followed by removal of solvent and excess paraldehyde at room temperature and 0.02 mm (oil vacuum). Recrystallization of the yellowish solid residue from ethanol at −30°C as described above gives another 22.5 g (24%) of product. The combined yield of (1'R)-(−)-4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose is 61.9 g (66%), mp 173-174°C.
An apparatus is assembled in the hood, as shown in Fig. 1. In the 2-l. globe-shaped separatory funnel H (stopcock J closed) is placed 1.3 l. of deaerated water. Three-holed rubber stopper G (bearing the stem of a 125-ml. separatory funnel C with stopcock D closed, a long inlet tube E, and a short outlet tube F) is inserted in the neck of H. In the neck of C, a rubber stopper B, provided with an inlet tube A, is inserted. H is flushed with nitrogen admitted at E. To the water is added 16.0 g. (0.1 mole) of alloxan monohydrate, and the mixture is stirred by the flow of nitrogen through E until the alloxan monohydrate has dissolved. The nitrogen flow is discontinued, and hydrogen sulfide is passed in at E until the mixture is saturated with this gas and the aqueous solution is free from opalescence (about 2 hours). Carbon disulfide (100 ml.) is now added, and the mixture is agitated for 5 minutes by means of the hydrogen sulfide gas stream. The carbon disulfide layer is then cautiously withdrawn through J and discarded, and the aqueous solution is washed once more with 100 ml. of carbon disulfide which is separated and discarded. The hydrogen sulfide flow is discontinued, and nitrogen is passed in at E for about 2 hours or until the gas emerging at F gives no more than a faint test for hydrogen sulfide with lead acetate paper.
A. t-Butyl hydrazodiformate. A solution of 28.6 g. (0.2 mole) of t-butyl azidoformate2 and 26.4 g. (0.2 mole) of t-butyl carbazate3 in 60 ml. of pyridine is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 week and is then diluted with 500 ml. of water. The snow-white microcrystalline powder that separates is removed by filtration and is washed with two 50-ml. portions of water. The yield of air-dried hydrazide, m.p. 124–126°, is 35.5–37 g. (77–80%). The product is pure enough for most applications but may be purified by recrystallization from a 1:1 mixture of benzene and ligroin (60–90°) from which it separates as small white needles, m.p. 124–125.5°. The recovery is 92%.
For further purification the material may be recrystallized from hot water, or dissolved in alkali and reprecipitated, or distilled under reduced pressure or sublimed. Each of these operations involves considerable loss of product, either through solubility or through decomposition by heat. The best-appearing product is obtained by distillation under reduced pressure. The crude acid is distilled from a Claisen flask with a delivery tube set low in order that the acid need not be heated much above the boiling point. The product boiling at 141–144°/20 mm. is pure white and melts at 125–132°. The yield of distilled acid is about 75–85 per cent of the weight of the crude acid.
The purification is accomplished by dissolving the crude product in 1 l. of 95% ethanol, adding 20 g. of Norit, and heating the mixture on a steam cone for 15 minutes with occasional shaking. After this time, 800 ml. of warm water is added, and the solution is heated 5 more minutes and filtered through a hot funnel. The greenish filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath, and the first crop (about 65 g.) of lemon-yellow needles of 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone is removed by filtration. The filtrate is then concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 800 ml., again chilled, and the second crop of product (about 15 g.) collected on a filter. The total yield of purified 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone, melting at 154–155°, is 75–85 g. (a recovery of 83–89%).
To a stainless-steel, 0.5-l. pressure vessel equipped with a 450-atm. manometer and a temperature recorder is added 0.2 g. (0.8 mmole) of rhodium(III) oxide. The vessel is sealed and evacuated to 0.1 mm. pressure. A solution of 82 g. (1.0 mole) of cyclohexene in 140 ml. of anhydrous benzene is introduced by suction into the vessel. The vessel is placed in a heatable shaking device and pressured to 75 atm. with carbon monoxide; the total pressure is then increased to 150 atm. with hydrogen. Shaking is begun and the vessel is heated to an internal temperature of 100°. When the internal temperature reaches 100°, the pressure begins to fall. Whenever the pressure falls to 60 atm., rocking is stopped and the pressure is first increased to 105 atm. with carbon monoxide, then to 150 atm. with hydrogen. Rocking is started again, and the process is continued until no appreciable pressure decrease occurs. Approximately 2 hours is required, and the pressure decrease corresponds to the consumption of 2 moles of gas. The vessel is rapidly cooled to room temperature and the residual gas is carefully vented.
B. erythro-3-Methanesulfonyloxy-2-butyl cyclobutanecarboxylate. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, cooled in an ice-water bath, equipped with a 50-ml. dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 35.3 g. (0.210 mole) of erytho-2,3-butanediol monomesylate and 150 ml. of dry pyridine. Stirring is begun, and 23.7 g. (0.200 mole) of cyclobutanecarboxylic acid chloride is added over a period of 1 hour. The cooling bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 8 hours. The mixture is added to 500 ml. of ether, and the resulting solution washed with three 250-ml. portions of 3 N sulfuric acid. The pyridine-free solution is washed with 250 ml. of a saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and then with 250 ml. of water. The ether solution is dried over 2 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 25°, giving 45.1–48.0 g. (90–96%) of erythro-3-methanesulfonyloxy-2-butyl cyclobutanecarboxylate as a pale yellow, viscous liquid.
In a 1-l. flask equipped with a reflux condenser and drying tube are placed 200 ml. (2.1 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol, 200 ml. (2.1 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 0.5 g. of anhydrous zinc chloride. After thorough shaking, the mixture is slowly heated to reflux temperature, maintained at gentle refluxing for 2 hours, and then cooled. The reflux condenser is replaced by a 20-cm. Vigreux column through which the mixture is distilled up to a temperature of 110°. The crude distillate, weighing 200–250 g., is washed with two 50-ml. portions of water, then with 50-ml. portions of 10% potassium carbonate until the ester layer is neutral to litmus; the product is finally dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate (about 20 g.).
After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of half-saturated brine is added to the reaction mixture, which is stirred for 10 min before the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted three times with 200 mL each of chloroform. The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of brine, 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 mL of brine. After the solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and removed in a rotary evaporator, a residue of 59 g is isolated.
The oil is loaded onto a column (4 cm diam × 14 cm height) of 100 g of silica gel with hexane. Using compressed air, the column is eluted with hexane (250 mL) and then ethyl acetate (300 mL). The ethyl acetate fraction (yellow solution) is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C/14 mmHg) to afford 19.08 g of yellow liquid. The liquid is distilled at reduced pressure to give 14.0 g (94%) of ethyl 3-chloro-3-phenylpropanoate (90 °C/0.2 mmHg) as a yellow oil.
A. N,N'-di-Boc-N"-triflylguanidine. A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 10-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel sealed with a rubber septum, gas inlet, and a large football-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is purged with nitrogen. The flask is charged with N,N'-di-Boc-guanidine (7.5 g, 29 mmol, Note 2), dichloromethane(100 mL, Note 3), and triethylamine (5.0 mL, 36 mmol, Note 4). The temperature of the mixture is equilibrated to −78°C using a dry ice/isopropyl alcohol bath. Triflic anhydride (5.9 mL, 35 mmol, Note 5) is added dropwise through the dropping funnel over a period of 20 min, and the resulting mixture is allowed to warm to −20°C over 4 hr. A 2 M aqueous sodium bisulfate solution is added to the mixture at −20°C, such that the reaction temperature does not rise above −10°C, and the resulting layers are stirred vigorously for 5 min (longer stir times lead to decreased yields). The layers are immediately separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 2 M aqueous sodium bisulfate (80 mL), brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude material is purified by flash column chromatography and dried under reduced pressure to afford N,N'-di-Boc-N"-triflylguanidine (10 g, 90%, mp 124°C, Notes 9, 10).
A. 2-l., wide-necked Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 66.2 g. (0.525 mole) of 2-(hydroxymethylene)cyclohexanone, 400 ml. of dichloromethane, and 106 g. (1.05 moles) of triethylamine. The flask is cooled in an ice–salt bath at −12 to −15°, and 98.0 g. (0.500 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl azide is added with vigorous mechanical stirring over a period of approximately 1 hour, at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above −5°. Stirring is continued for an additional 2 hours as the cooling bath melts. A solution of 30.8 g. (0.550 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. The resulting emulsion is placed in a 2-l. separatory funnel, the dichloromethane layer is separated after the emulsion has broken, and the aqueous, alcoholic layer is washed with two 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane solutions are washed with a solution of 2.8 g. of potassium hydroxide in 200 ml. of water, then with 200 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 35° (15 mm.) until the weight of the residue is constant, yielding 51.5–59.0 g. (83–95%) of yellow-orange 2-diazocyclohexanone. Distillation with magnetic stirring of 20 g. of this crude product from a hot-water bath at 80° gave 17.0 g. of yellow-orange liquid, b.p. 46° (0.1 mm.) or 60° (0.4 mm.). The IR spectrum (liquid film) has a strong band at 2083 cm.−1 attributable to the diazo function.
The crude naphthoquinone is warmed gently on the steam bath with 1.5 l. of ether, when it rapidly dissolves and leaves in suspension a slight amount of dark, fluffy material. The solution is shaken for ten minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon; it is then filtered, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath until crystals begin to form. The solution is then allowed to cool undisturbed, and the clear canary-yellow prisms which separate are collected and washed with ether. The mother liquor is clarified by shaking as before with 7 g. of decolorizing carbon, filtered, and evaporated to a small volume until crystals begin to separate. The crystals are again washed with ether, and the mother liquor is clarified and evaporated once more. The final crop of material is dull in color but yields a pure product on recrystallization. All the material is of a high quality and melts at 124–125° to a clear yellow liquid; the yield is 44–46 g. (78–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mushy residue is shaken with 250–300 ml. of water until the sodium acetate dissolves. The oily layer of lactone is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are washed with 150 ml. of water and dried overnight over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed under reduced pressure, and the product is distilled from a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 160–170°/11 mm. is collected; refractionation yields 107–114 g. (61–64%) of product boiling at 164–168°/11 mm. or 151–156°/8 mm.; n25D 1.4815–1.4830 and.
The mixture in the flask is slowly distilled. As soon as about 500 cc. of the lighter liquid has collected, it is placed in a fractionating apparatus and distilled, the material which boils up to 79° being collected separately. This fraction, which consists principally of alcohol, with a little carbon tetrachloride and moisture, is dried with potassium carbonate and returned to the reaction mixture. The higher fractions are redistilled.
To the dry salt is added 0.3 g. of copper powder, 81 g. (0.51 mole) of bromobenzene, and a few drops of guaiacol. The mixture is stirred thoroughly with a glass rod; the flask is fitted with an air condenser and heated in a metal bath. A reaction becomes evident at a bath temperature of 160–180°, liquefaction occurs, and the color of the mixture changes to red or purple. The temperature is gradually raised to 200° and maintained at 200° for 2 hours.

Under an argon atmosphere, a 2-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a thermometer and magnetic stirring bar is charged with (S)-[1-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-2-methylpropyl]carbamic acid, tert-butyl ester (2) (97.8 g, 0.275 mol) and THF (1.8 L). The resulting solution is cooled to an internal temperature below 5°C with an ice bath. Potassium tert-butoxide (37.0 g, 0.330 mol) is then added in one portion. A few minutes after the addition of potassium tert-butoxide a white solid begins to precipitate. Stirring below 5°C is continued for 2 hr. The resulting suspension is poured into a 10% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride (2 L) and stirred for 10 min. The white solids are collected and washed with water (4 × 400 mL). The solids are transferred to a 1-L flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar. Methanol (650 mL) is added and the resulting suspension is heated to reflux for 1 hr with stirring. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and stirring is continued for 1 hr in an ice bath. The white solids are collected and washed with ice-cold methanol (100 mL).

(30 ml., 0.34 mole) of 1-nitropropane, and 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid is refluxed for 12.5 hours. During the reflux period the pale-yellow mixture becomes dark red. The volatile reactants and solvent are removed under reduced pressure, and an excess of water is then added to the dark residue. After a short time, crude indole-3-carbonitrile precipitates rapidly. It is separated by filtration and dried under reduced pressure; weight 1.20–1.34 g. (85–95%). Crystallization from acetone-hexane, with decolorization by activated carbon, yields 0.68–0.89 g. (48–63%) of fairly pure indole-3-carbonitrile, m.p. 179.5–182.5°.
The crude acetonedicarboxylic acid from 700 g. (3.64 moles) of citric acid, as described on p. 10, is treated with 700 g. (882 cc.) of absolute ethyl alcohol (pp. 249 and 259) to which has been added at least 130–150 g. of dry hydrogen chloride (p. 293). The mixture is placed in a flask fitted with a stopper holding a calcium chloride tube and then is heated to 45°. It is kept in a water bath at 45° (bath temperature) with frequent shaking until all the acid is dissolved (fifteen to twenty minutes). The solution is allowed to cool down to room temperature in the bath and finally to stand about twelve hours.
The salt is dissolved in 800 cc. of water and transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. To the solution is added with constant stirring a solution of 200 g. (0.6 mole) of lead nitrate in 400 cc. of water. Lead sulfide separates as a heavy brown precipitate which soon turns black. The mixture is then distilled with steam into a receiver containing 5–10 cc. of 1 N sulfuric acid as long as any oil comes over. About 2–3 l. of distillate is collected. The product is separated from the water and weighs 63–66 g.
The condenser is then set for distillation and the allyl cyanide is distilled from the flask by heating it in an oil bath with stirring and. Upon redistillation, the allyl cyanide is pure and boils at 116–121° with almost no loss. The yield is 98–103 g. (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The reaction mixture is cooled, and the crude p-aminophenyl disulfide, obtained as spherical lumps amounting to 125–150 g. and melting at 73°, is collected on a Büchner funnel. It is dissolved in 1 l. of hot ethanol, and the small amount of insoluble material is removed by filtration. To the hot solution is then added 800 ml. of water containing several grams of sodium hydrosulfite to prevent discoloration of the solution by oxidation. The solution is cooled, and an additional 700 ml. of water is added with stirring to reduce the solubility of the product. The crystalline precipitate is removed by filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of pure product melting at 75–76° is 108–120 g. (58–64%).

The flask is cooled in an ice bath, and a mixture of 57 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 81 ml. of water is added with stirring. With the temperature at about 5°, a total of 65 g. of sodium nitrite (0.944 mole) is added in portions over a period of 1.5 hours, the temperature being maintained around 5° during the addition. After all the sodium nitrite is added, the ice bath is removed, and the stirring is continued for 4 hours. During this time, the temperature reaches a maximum of 34–38° within 2 hours and falls to about 29° by the end of the stirring period. Gases which escape during the reaction (mostly oxides of nitrogen) are led to the hood.
A 1-L, four-necked flask is fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer. Acetic acid (558 g) is introduced and 107.6 g (0.439 mol) of manganese acetate tetrahydrate is added with stirring and heating under nitrogen. When the temperature reaches 90°C, 16.5 g of solid potassium permanganate (0.104 mol) is added. After the temperature has again fallen to 90°C, 175 mL (189 g, 1.86 mol) of acetic anhydride is added. When the temperature rise has ceased, 44.0 g of 1-decene (0.312 mol) is introduced, followed at once by 250 g of anhydrous sodium acetate. The reaction mixture is then heated to reflux (134°C pot temperature). After 2 hr of reflux under nitrogen the reaction mixture, now clear yellow, is diluted with 1 L of water. The crude product is extracted into 200 mL of benzene, and the aqueous layer again washed with 100 mL of benzene. Benzene is distilled from the combined extracts to give 55.1 g of lactone and 1-decene. 1-Decene is removed by vacuum distillation, followed by the lactone, which distills at 98–99°C (0.05 mm). The yield of γ-(n-octyl)-γ-butyrolactone is 34.1 g (66% based on potassium permanganate. However, the lactone yield based on olefin consumed is greater than 95%.)
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, is dissolved 5 g. of mercuric oxide in a solution of 8 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 190 ml. of water.

The green organic layer which settles is taken up in 150 ml. of ether, and the aqueous layer is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed, the ether is evaporated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 15-cm. column packed with glass helices. The 1-acetylcyclohexanol is collected at 92–94°/15 mm. as a colorless liquid, n25D 1.4670, d254 1.0248. The yield is 37–38 g. (65–67%).
To the reaction mixture is added dropwise 90 mL of 3 N aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by 90 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The mixture is stirred for 30 min to complete the oxidation process. A total of 3 g of sodium bisulfite, 5 g of sodium chloride, and 125 mL of ether are added and the mixture is stirred for 10 min. On standing, the reaction mixture separates into two layers, which are separated with a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with brine (2 × 50 mL). The water layer and the brine washes are combined and extracted with ether (3 × 125 mL). All the organic layers are then combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of solvent under reduced pressure yield 110 g of a pale-yellow oil containing the desired product as well as ( + )-isopinocampheol, and ( − )-α-pinene. The product mixture is dissolved in 250 mL of ether and is extracted with 1 M aqueous silver nitrate solution (3 × 100 mL). The aqueous layers are combined and back-extracted once with 50 mL of ether. The ether layers containing ( + )-isopinocampheol are discarded.

The solution is cooled to −78°C, and 31.5 mL (31.5 mmol) of 1 M diisobutylaluminum hydride (in hexane ) (DIBAL-H) is added dropwise over 15 min via a syringe pump. After the addition is complete, the resultant solution is stirred at −78°C for 2 hr. The reaction is quenched by pouring the cold solution into 250 mL of saturated aqueous Rochelle's salt. Ether (300 mL) and H2O (75 mL) are added and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hr. The layers are separated and the ether layer is washed with brine. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 × 50 mL) and the combined extracts are dried over Na2SO4 . Filtration of the solution and concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure followed by purification of the crude product by flash chromatography yields 7.85 g (86%) of (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal as a white solid.
In order to remove zinc salts from the crude azobenzene, the latter is added to 500 ml. of 2% hydrochloric acid, the mixture is warmed to about 70° in order to melt the azobenzene and is stirred rapidly for about 5 minutes. Stirring is continued while the mixture is chilled to solidify the azobenzene. The product is filtered, washed well with water, and recrystallized from a mixture of 720 ml. of 95% ethanol and 60 ml. of water. The yield of azobenzene melting at 66–67.5° is 156–160 g. (84–86%).
The apparatus is allowed to cool to room temperature, the pressure is released, and the catalyst is removed by filtration. The filtrate is made acid to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution is cooled to 0° in an ice-salt bath and held at that temperature for 30 minutes before filtration.

Pine oleoresin [1 kg. containing 260 g. (0.86 mole) of levopimaric acid] and is dissolved in 2 l. of acetone in a 4-l. beaker. A solution of 200 g. (2.2 moles) of 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol in 200 ml. of acetone is added as rapidly as possible with stirring. The pasty precipitate which forms almost immediately is collected by suction filtration and is pressed as dry as possible using a rubber dam. The crude moist precipitate is returned to a 2-l. beaker and is dissolved in the minimum volume (~1 l.) of boiling methanol.

This addition requires four to six hours. When all has been added the ice bath is removed; the temperature of the mixture generally rises enough to cause gentle boiling. When this ceases the mixture is warmed on a steam bath for one hour longer.

All the contents of the reaction are transferred to a separatory funnel and successively washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 × 50 mL), brine (3 × 50 mL) and deionized water (3 × 50 mL). The combined aqueous layers are extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. Recrystallization from ethanol gives 9-ethyl-3,6-dimethylcarbazole (3.62 g, 81% yield) as white needles, mp 57-58°C (lit.2 mp 62-63°C).

The phases are separated, and the aqueous solution is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution until carbon dioxide no longer forms. The solution is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and dried over about 25 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate for 12 hours, after which it is decanted into another Erlenmeyer flask and dried over about 10 g. of Drierite for 6 hours.

A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 200-mL dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 6.2 g (0.16 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride and and 200 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. The dropping funnel is charged with 42 g (0.48 mol) of 2-hydroxycyclobutanone and 150 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. While the suspension of lithium aluminum hydride is gently stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere, the solution of 2-hydroxycyclobutanone is added dropwise at a rate maintaining a gentle reflux. When the addition is complete, the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr. After the mixture has returned to room temperature, 200 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added.

To this flask is added 10% of 78.5 g (0.5 mol) of bromobenzene in one portion. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux without stirring to start Grignard reagent formation. When the reaction has started, the rest of the bromobenzene in 100 mL of diethyl ether is added with stirring at such a rate that gentle reflux is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for an additional 1 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and diethyl ether is added to give a total volume of about 300 mL. The reflux condenser and the dropping funnel are replaced by a nitrogen inlet tube and a pierced rubber septum with Teflon tube inlet.
(A) Dibenzoyldibromomethane.—In a 1-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer, are placed 56 g. (0.25 mole) of dibenzoylmethane (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 205; Org. Syn. 20, 32) and 14 cc. of chloroform. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 28.5 cc. (88 g., 0.55 mole) of dry bromine in 230 cc. of chloroform is added slowly from the dropping funnel during a period of about thirty minutes. The temperature of the mixture should not exceed 15° during the bromination; the hydrogen bromide evolved is continuously removed by aspirating a gentle stream of air over the surface of the solution. After all the bromine has been added, stirring is continued for about fifteen minutes. The solution is then transferred to a distilling flask, and the solvent is completely removed under diminished pressure at room temperature. The slightly colored residue is crystallized from 125 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The dibenzoyldibromomethane is obtained in the form of white crystals melting at 94–95°. The yield is 72.4 g. (76 per cent of the theoretical amount).
C. (R)-(+)-Citronellal. [(R)-(+)-3,7-Dimethyl-6-octanal]. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and an ice bath is charged with 33.4 g (0.16 mol) of (R)-(−)-N,N-diethyl-(E)-citronellalenamine in 80 mL of ether at 0°C. To this stirred solution is added 80 mL of a 1 : 4 glacial acetic acid–deionized water solution in one portion. The reaction mixture is stirred for 5 min at 0°C and then at room temperature for 25 min. The ether layer is separated and washed successively with 50 mL of water, two 50-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, 50 mL of water, and 50 mL of saturated brine. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The ether solution is concentrated at 40°C under reduced pressure (60 mm) to a pale-yellow liquid. The liquid is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to give 22.5 g (91.4%) of (+)-citronellal as a colorless liquid, bp 79–80°C (7 mm), [α]D25 +15.7° (neat, d 0.851). The product is 99.4% chemically pure by GLC and has an optical purity of 95.2%.
B. 2,4-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-5-methylpyrimidine . In an oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask is placed thymine (12.6 g, 0.1 mol) and chlorotrimethylsilane in 300 mL of benzene under an argon atmosphere. To the stirred suspension is added triethylamine (20.2 g, 0.2 mol) dropwise via a dropping funnel over 1 hr. After the addition is complete, the reaction is stirred overnight. The precipitated triethylammonium chloride and unreacted thymine are removed by suction filtration and the solid is washed with dry benzene (2 × 30 mL). The solvent is then removed with a rotary evaporator. The resulting viscous oil is distilled under reduced pressure (bp 94-97°C at 9 mm, lit.3 bp 124°C at 14 mm) to give 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-5-methylpyrimidine (24.0 g, 89% yield). The product solidifies upon standing overnight, mp 73-75°C (lit.3 mp 63-65°C).
The hydrobromic acid is distilled under reduced pressure on a steam bath. The residue is treated with 400–500 cc. of water, and the solution is again concentrated under reduced pressure to remove as much hydrobromic acid as possible.
C. Ethylene dithiotosylate. To 200 ml. of ethanol containing 10–20 mg. of potassium iodide is added 45.3 g. (0.200 mole) of potassium thiotosylate and 18.8 g. (0.100 mole) of 1,2-dibromopropane. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 8 hours in the dark and under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solvent is removed, and the resulting white solid is washed with a mixture of 80 ml. of ethanol and 150 ml. of water. After decantation, the solid is washed three times with 50-ml. portions of water and recrystallized from approximately 150 ml. of ethanol, yielding 28.7 g. of crude product, m.p. 72–75°. Three recrystallizations from a mixture of ethyl acetate and ethanol afford 24 g. (60%) of white crystals, m.p. 75–76°.
The reaction mixture is then hydrolyzed in the flask with about 500 cc. of 25 per cent sulfuric acid. Cooling the solution with ice and water permits of rapid hydrolysis without danger of loss of material through too vigorous refluxing. The mixture is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and the ether layer separated. The water layer is extracted with three 50-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with about 150 cc. of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until all the organic acid is converted to the salt and thus removed and.
A 3-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a tube for introducing dry carbon dioxide. Twenty-five grams (0.11 mole) of benzophenone dichloride is put into the flask, the air in the flask is displaced by a stream of carbon dioxide, and the sodium hydrosulfide solution is added slowly. A vigorous reaction, which must be controlled by cooling, takes place, and the reaction mixture becomes deep blue in color.
A. (5aS,9aS,11aS)-Perhydro-5H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11-dione (1). A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer bearing a glass paddle, a dry ice/acetone-cooled cold-finger condenser bearing a nitrogen inlet/outlet valve vented through a mineral oil bubbler, and a gas inlet is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and charged with 25.0 g (0.116 mol) of 99% pure (S)-(+)-2,3-dihydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepine-5,11(10H,11aH)dione and a solution of 42.2 g (0.570 mol) of tert-butyl alcohol in 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). The mixture is cooled to −78°C (dry ice/acetone bath) and 2 L of dry ammonia is distilled into the mixture. After stirring is initiated, a total of 35.7 g (0.912 mol) of potassium metal is added to the reaction mixture in small chunks at −78°C, and the resulting blue-colored solution is stirred for 1 hr. The reaction is then carefully quenched at −78°C by the addition of 61 g (1.14 mol) of solid ammonium chloride. The cooling bath and condenser are removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate overnight. The residue is suction filtered, and the filter cake is washed with 100 mL of chloroform. The filtrate is diluted with 200 mL of water, transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, the organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 100 mL of chloroform. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is crystallized from ethyl acetate, and the mother liquor purified by chromatography to give a total of 17.8 g (69%) of 1 (Rf 0.31, EtOAc/MeOH, 9:1) as a colorless solid, mp 225–227°C, [α]D23 +55° (CHCl3, c 0.61) and.
A. Diethyl (−)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Dean-Stark trap is charged with 103 g (500 mmol) of diethyl L-tartrate, 53.1 g (500 mmol) of benzaldehyde, 600 mL of cyclohexane and 2.80 g (14.7 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The stirred mixture is heated with azeotropic removal of water. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and then is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mm, 30°C). The residual yellow oil is dissolved in 400 mL of diethyl ether, transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and washed with saturated aqueous potassium bicarbonate (200 mL) , and with water (2 × 200 mL). The ethereal layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 mm, 30°C), followed by removal of solvent at 0.02 mm at room temperature. The solid crude product is collected by suction filtration through a sintered-glass funnel to give diethyl (−)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate as yellow crystals. Trituration of the crude solid product with 150 mL of hexanes and collection of the purified product by suction filtration through a sintered-glass funnel gives 105 g (71%) of purified product, mp 47°C.
The [18]annulene mother liquors contain 181 mg. of unchanged tridehydro[18]annulene, as determined by the electronic spectrum (see Part B). They are combined with the "mixed fractions" described in Part B (containing 270 mg. of tridehydro[18]annulene), and the resulting solution is evaporated to dryness. The residue is dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene and stirred with hydrogen and 1.0 g. of a 10% palladium-on-calcium carbonate catalyst, as before, until 216 ml. (4.4 molar equivalents) of hydrogen (20°, 740 mm.) are absorbed. The catalyst is removed, and the filtrate is concentrated to approximately 6 ml., as described previously. After the addition of 20 ml. of ether and cooling in an ice bath, 112 mg. of [18]annulene is collected by filtration. The purity of the product is confirmed by TLC. The total yield of [18]annulene is 268 mg. (0.54% overall from 1,5-hexadiyne,.
The nitrobenzene is then removed by vacuum distillation using a 2-l. Claisen flask, and the residue in the flask is distilled under diminished pressure; the fraction boiling at 180–195°/15 mm. is collected and. The red-yellow oil, which solidifies on cooling, amounts to 128–176 g. (40–55%) and is sufficiently pure for some purposes. A nearly white product can be obtained by dissolving the crude product in ether, shaking the ether solution with portions of 5% sodium hydroxide solution until no color appears in the aqueous layer, evaporating the ether, and recrystallizing the residue from a mixture of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90°, Skellysolve B) and benzene. The recrystallized product melts at 83–84°; the recovery is 80–85%.
D. 2,6-Dihydroxyacetophenone (IV). A 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a glass tube, extending to the bottom of the flask, connected to a cylinder of nitrogen. In the flask are placed 148 g. (0.68 mole) of 4-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin and 500 ml. of distilled water. A rapid stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the water suspension until all the air in the apparatus is displaced, and then a slow stream of the gas is kept passing through the solution. A solution of 129 g. (3.23 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 580 ml. of water is added through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is heated on a steam bath for 5 hours. The solution is then cooled and acidified by the addition of about 1 l. of dilute (1:3) hydrochloric acid. The stream of nitrogen gas is continued throughout the period of heating and while the solution is cooling. It may be stopped after the solution is acid. The crude 2,6-dihydroxyacetophenone which separates on acidification is collected on a filter, washed three times with 50-ml. portions of cold water, and air-dried. A yield of 90–95 g. (87–92% based on the 4-methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin) of light-yellow solid is obtained.
Four hundred milliliters of 25% sulfuric acid is added, and the contents of the funnel are shaken continually until the copper derivative has disappeared (5–10 minutes). After separation of the ethereal layer, the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over calcium chloride. The ether is removed on the steam bath and the residual ester distilled under diminished pressure. A few drops come over up to 90°, but the bulk of the material distils at 92–98°/12 mm. Redistillation yields pure ethyl diacetylacetate boiling at 95–97°/12 mm. The yield is 80–90 g. (46–52%).
The dried benzene extract is placed in a 250-ml. flask fitted with a 30-cm. fractionating column, and the benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. Fractionation of the residue is carried out under reduced pressure using a 50-ml. Claisen flask with a built-in 12- to 15-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 100–103°/13 mm. is collected; it weighs 11 to 14.7 g. (41–55%).
A. 2-(Trimethylsilyl)thiazole (2-TST). A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is equipped with two 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnels and a low-temperature thermometer. The dry apparatus is filled with argon and kept under a slightly positive pressure (ca. 100 mm) of this gas for the entire reaction time. The flask is charged with 200 mL of freshly distilled diethyl ether and 111 mL of a 1.5 M solution of butyllithium (0.167 mol) in hexane and. One of the two dropping funnels is charged with 25 g (0.152 mol) of 2-bromothiazole in 50 mL of diethyl ether and the other with 16.5 g (0.152 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane in 50 mL of diethyl ether. The reaction flask is cooled to −78°C in a dry ice-acetone bath. While the solution in the flask is stirred, 2-bromothiazole is added dropwise over a period of 1 hr. After 20 min additional stirring, chlorotrimethylsilane is added dropwise over 30 min and stirring is continued for 1 hr at −78°C. The resulting mixture is then allowed to warm up to room temperature. A saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (200 mL) is added and the mixture is transferred into a 1-L separatory funnel. After the mixture is shaken, the organic layer is recovered and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (200 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure by rotary evaporation with the external bath temperature not higher than 40°C. The residue is distilled from a 100-mL flask at reduced pressure in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 10-cm Vigreux column. The distillation, after a forerun at 40–65°C (15 mm) consisting mainly of bromobutane, gives 20.2 g (85%) of 2-(trimethylsilyl)thiazole as a colorless liquid, bp 88–91°C (16–17 mm).
Twenty-five grams (0.18 mole) of salicylic acid (m.p. 159–160°) is dissolved in 225 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. beaker provided with a mechanical stirrer. To this is added with stirring a solution of 62 g. (0.38 mole) of iodine monochloride in 165 cc. of glacial acetic acid; then 725 cc. of water is added. A yellow precipitate of diiodosalicylic acid appears. The reaction mixture is gradually heated with stirring on a hot plate to 80° and kept at approximately that temperature for twenty minutes. The entire period of heating should be about forty minutes. Toward the end of the reaction the mixture becomes rather difficult to stir because of the voluminous precipitate. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitate is filtered on a Büchner funnel and washed with acetic acid and then with water. When no more water is removed by suction, the solid (75 g.) is dissolved in 100 cc. of warm acetone and filtered by gravity. To the filtrate 400 cc. of water is slowly added with shaking. The fine, flocculent precipitate is filtered by suction, washed with water, and dried. The yield of diiodosalicylic acid melting at 235–236° is 64–64.5 g. (91–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 1-l. flask fitted with a paddle-blade stirrer are placed 138 g. (1 mole) of anisyl alcohol and 248 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After stirring vigorously for 15 minutes the contents of the flask are transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower layer (anisyl chloride) is separated, dried over 20 g. of granular calcium chloride for about 30 minutes, and filtered to remove the drying agent.
(B) o-Tolunitrile.—While the cuprous cyanide solution is cooling, 428 g. (427 cc., 4 moles) of o-toluidine is mixed in a 20-l. crock with 1 l. of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and enough cracked ice, about 4 kg., to bring the temperature of the mixture to 0°. A solution of 280 g. (4.06 moles) of sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water is added, with stirring, to the resulting suspension of o-toluidine hydrochloride, the temperature being kept at 0–5° by the addition of cracked ice. The addition of the nitrite occupies about fifteen minutes; at the end of the operation, the mixture must show a distinct and permanent reaction for free nitrous acid on testing with starch-iodide paper. The final volume of the solution is 5–6 l. The mixture is now cautiously neutralized by adding dry sodium carbonate with constant stirring, using litmus paper to determine the end-point; about 200 g. of the anhydrous carbonate is required.
The cathode liquid is removed from the cells and neutralized with solid ammonium carbonate or concentrated aqueous ammonia. The solution is filtered to remove any resinous material, then saturated with ammonium sulfate and extracted with five 80-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform solution is dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium or magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the chloroform is removed by evaporation on a steam bath. The yield of o-aminobenzyl alcohol obtained from the four cells is 62–70 g. (69–78%).
The entire reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer is discarded, and the oily yellow organic layer is washed first with a 50-ml. portion of 10% aqueous sodium carbonate and then with 50 ml. of water. The product is dried over 1 g. of calcium chloride and filtered. The yield of t-butyl hypochlorite, 99–100% pure, is 29.6–34 g. (70–80%),. The product can be stored conveniently in a freezer or refrigerator over calcium chloride in amber glass bottles.
(A) o-Nitrobenzenesulfonyl Chloride.—A 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient liquid-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, and an inlet tube for introducing chlorine well beneath the surface of the liquid. A glass outlet tube leads from the reflux condenser to the hood. In the flask are placed 200 g. (0.65 mole) of di-o-nitrophenyl disulfide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 220), 1 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), and 200 cc. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42). A stream of chlorine is passed into the mixture at the rate of about two bubbles per second, and the solution is warmed on a steam bath to 70°. In about thirty minutes the disulfide melts and the solution becomes orange-red in color. After the disulfide has melted, the heating and addition of chlorine are continued for one hour. The sulfonyl chloride is separated immediately from the supernatant liquid by decantation, washed with two 300-cc. portions of warm water (70°), and allowed to solidify. The water is drained from the solid mass as completely as possible.
The dropping funnel is replaced with a three-way stopcock with an attached nitrogen source and a bubbler open to the system (see Figure 1). The thermometer and mechanical stirrer are replaced with ground-glass plugs, and the condenser is replaced with a 1-l., 90-mm., medium-porosity fritted-disk nitrogen pressure funnel attached to a 1-l., round-bottomed, two-necked flask fitted with a three-way stopcock on the side arm. All joints are either clamped or taped together, and the apparatus is carefully inverted, pouring the slurry into the funnel. The mixture is filtered with nitrogen pressure into the 1-l. receiving flask, which is maintained under a nitrogen atmosphere. The solid filter cake is rinsed with three 50-ml. portions of 4:1 (v/v) ether–dioxane injected with a long needle syringe through the three-way stopcock. The four-necked flask is rinsed by manipulation of the needle, and the apparatus and the solids are dispersed in each rinse. The pale-yellow filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure with a warm water bath at 40°, and the powdery white solid is dried at 10-mm. pressure for 4 hours at 25°, yielding 38.3–48.8 g. (63–80%) of bis(pentafluorophenylcopper)dioxane complex. The color of this dioxane complex varies from tan to white. The complex is transferred to a 200-ml., round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is evacuated to a pressure of 0.001 mm., immersed in an oil bath, and slowly heated to 100° over 1 hour. The temperature is slowly and constantly increased to 128° during a second hour and maintained at 128° for 4 hours. Pure pentafluorophenylcopper tetramer is obtained as a gray to tan powder weighing 29.8–34.7 g. (58–68%).
A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper, a Teflon-coated thermocouple, and a Leibig reflux condenser fitted with an inert gas inlet tube that is attached to a nitrogen manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, (0.2 mmHg) flushed with nitrogen, cooled to room temperature, and maintained under a slightly positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is charged with InCl3 (0.775 g, 3.5 mmol), which is then dried by heating the bottom of the flask with a hot air gun under vacuum (0.2 mmHg) for 2 min. The flask is then refilled with nitrogen and kept under a slightly positive pressure. The glass stopper is removed and to the flask are added benzil (14.7 g, 70 mmol), dichloromethane (140 mL) (by syringe), and ethyl 3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropanoate (by syringe) (13.6 g, 70 mmol). Chlorodimethylsilane (HSiMe2Cl) (7.28 g, 77 mmol) is added to the resulting mixture by syringe through an open neck while stirring. The stopper is replaced and gentle evolution of gas (H2) starts in a few minutes. The extent of the gas evolution gradually increases and the reaction temperature slowly increases.
C. (E)-1-Benzyl-3-(1-iodoethylidene)piperidine (3). A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser topped with a rubber septum inlet is flushed with argon and charged with 4.0 g (21 mmol) of alkynylamine 2, 11 g (73 mmol) of sodium iodide, 35 mL of 37% w/w formaldehyde solution, 5.4 g (22 mmol) of camphorsulfonic acid monohydrate and 80 mL of water. The resulting mixture is heated at reflux under an argon atmosphere for 15 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. This solution is made basic by adding 5 M aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and then poured into a separatory funnel where it is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue is purified by flash chromatography (ca. 150 g of silica gel, 1:1 hexane-ethyl ether containing 5% triethylamine as eluent) to give 5.4–6.2 g (79–90%) of 3 as a colorless oil and.
A 500-ml. flask is charged with 318 g. (3 moles) of 1,2,4-trihydroxybutane and 3 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. A few Carborundum boiling chips are added, the flask is equipped with a 30.5-cm. Vigreux column, condenser, and receiver arranged for vacuum distillation, and the contents are heated, with swirling, to dissolve the acid. The flask is then heated in a bath held at 180–220° so that 300–306 g. of distillate, b.p. 85–87°/22 mm., is collected over a period of 2–2.5 hours. The colorless liquid obtained is refractionated, the same apparatus being used, and two fractions are collected: the first, 50–60 g., b.p. 42–44°/24 mm., nD25 1.3343, is mainly water. After a negligible intermediate fraction, 215–231 g. (81–88%) of pure 3-hydroxytetrahydrofuran, b.p. 93–95°/26 mm., nD25 1.4497, d420 = 1.095, is collected.
B. Benzocyclopropene. A dry, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 35.0 g (0.312 mole) of potassium tert-butoxide, followed by 200 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide. The stirred mixture is cooled to 15–20° with an ice bath before 24.5 g. (0.154 mole) of 7,7-dichlorobicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene is added over a 7-minute period. The bath is removed, the mixture stirred an additional 25 minutes, and the reaction quenched by first cooling the flask with an ice bath and then adding 180 ml. of ice water. The crude product is pumped directly into an acetone–dry ice cold trap through a glass vacuum take-off adapter. The tert-butyl alcohol and dimethyl sulfoxide are removed by washing the distillate once with 400 ml. of ice water and. The benzocyclopropene that separates as the lower layer is distilled from 1 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, using the apparatus shown in Figure 1. This procedure gives 4.35–5.48 g. (32–41%) of almost pure benzocyclopropene.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a separatory funnel is placed 40 g. (1.65 atoms) of magnesium turnings. This is covered with 200 cc. of dry ether, and there is then added 100 cc. of a mixture of 260 g. (1.65 moles) of dry bromobenzene and 800 cc. of dry ether. As soon as the reaction starts, 200 cc. more of dry ether is added and the remainder of the bromobenzene solution at such a rate as to cause gentle boiling (about two hours). With external cooling, the time may be shortened.
An oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum inlet, an alcohol thermometer, and, through the center neck, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a calcium chloride drying tube. The apparatus is flushed with argon and the flask is placed in an ice water bath. To the flask are added (−)-menthol (15.63 g, 100 mmol) and 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this stirred solution is added dropwise through the dropping funnel butyllithium in hexane (1.60 M, 55 mL, 88 mmol), transferred by syringe, at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20°C (about 10 min). When the addition is complete, the methyl ester [either methyl cinnamate (16.21 g, 100 mmol) or methyl nicotinate (13.71 g, 100 mmol)], dissolved in 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran, is added in one lot to the solution and washed in with an additional 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The resulting solution, which slowly becomes cloudy, is stirred for another hour and and then poured into 200 mL of water in a 1-L separatory funnel; the flask is washed out with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer is separated and the organic phase is washed twice with 200 mL of water. After the organic phase is dried with magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled from a 100-mL flask bearing a Vigreux column under reduced pressure (0.1–0.5 mm). After a forerun of 2–3 g the (1R)-(−)-menthyl ester is collected. (1R)-(−)-Menthyl cinnamate distills at 145–147°C (0.2 mm) and is greater than 99% pure by GLC. The yield is 22.6–23.9 g (79–83%). (1R)-(−)-Menthyl nicotinate boils at 141–143°C (0.5 mm) and is greater than 99% pure by GLC. The yield is 20.1–21.7 g (77–83%).
A three-necked 500-ml. flask is surrounded by an ice-water bath and provided with a stirrer and thermometer. Twenty-seven grams (0.55 mole) of sodium cyanide is dissolved in 100 ml. of water, added to the reaction flask, and cooled to 0°. To this, in 3- to 4-g. portions, is added with good stirring a total of 127 g. (0.50 mole) of iodine over a period of 30–40 minutes. A given portion of iodine is not added until the preceding one has reacted almost completely. Ten minutes after the addition of iodine is completed, 120 ml. of peroxide-free ether is added and the mixture is stirred for a few minutes until the precipitated cyanogen iodide has dissolved in the ethereal layer. The entire contents are then transferred to a previously cooled separatory funnel, and the aqueous layer is separated. This aqueous solution is again extracted successively with 100-ml. and 80-ml. portions of cold, peroxide-free ether. The combined ethereal extracts are poured into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, and the ether is evaporated under reduced pressure at room temperature. To the slightly brown crude product, which weighs about 90 g., is added 120 ml. of water. A slightly diminished pressure (½ atm.) is maintained while the contents in the closed flask are heated at 50° for 15 minutes with occasional vigorous shaking. The mixture is then cooled to 0°, and the crystalline cyanogen iodide is separated from the light yellow mother liquor by suction on a sintered-glass funnel or filter plate. The crude product is washed with six 25-ml. portions of ice water, removed from the sintered-glass funnel, and air-dried (in a good hood) for 1 hour at room temperature. Colorless cyanogen iodide weighing about 59 g. (77%) is obtained; m.p. 141–144°.
In a 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and a condenser connected to an apparatus for removing hydrogen chloride, are placed 858 g. (980 cc., 11 moles) of dry benzene and 464 g. (3.48 moles) of aluminum chloride. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath to 10°, and then 405.1 g. (3 moles) of commercial sulfur chloride in 390 g. (450 cc., 5 moles) of benzene is added, with stirring, over a period of one hour, the temperature being kept at about 10°. The reaction begins at once as evidenced by the evolution of hydrogen chloride and the separation of a yellow viscous aluminum chloride complex. When all the sulfur chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is removed from the ice bath, stirred at room temperature for two hours, and then heated at 30° until practically no hydrogen chloride is evolved (one hour). The mixture is then poured on 1 kg. of cracked ice, and, when hydrolysis is complete, the benzene layer is separated from the water layer by means of a separatory funnel. The benzene is distilled on a steam bath, and the resulting dark-colored oil is cooled to 0° and filtered through a Büchner funnel to remove the sulfur which separates. The residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of commercial methyl alcohol, and the solution is cooled to 0°. Stirring is continued for three hours, and the precipitated sulfur is removed as before. The alcohol is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled from a 1-l. modified Claisen flask with a water-cooled side-arm receiver. After a small amount of low-boiling product passes over, there is obtained 470–490 g. of a yellow liquid boiling at 155–170°/18 mm. The material thus obtained is heated for one hour on a steam bath, with stirring, with 70 g. of zinc dust and 200 g. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The diphenyl sulfide is then separated from the sodium hydroxide, washed with two 500-cc. portions of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled. The yield of colorless diphenyl sulfide boiling at 162–163°/18 mm. is 450–464 g. (81–83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. N-Phenylmaleimide. In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 670 ml. of acetic anhydride and 65 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate. The maleanilic acid (316 g.), obtained as described above, is added, and the resulting suspension is dissolved by swirling and heating on a steam bath for 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled almost to room temperature in a cold water bath and is then poured into 1.3 l. of ice water. The precipitated product is removed by suction filtration, washed three times with 500-ml. portions of ice-cold water and once with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°), and dried. The yield of crude N-phenylmaleimide is 214–238 g. (75–80%), m.p. 88–89°. Recrystallization from cyclohexane gives canary-yellow needles, m.p. 89–89.8°.
A. Potassium 3-aminopropylamide (KAPA). To a bottle of 22.4% potassium hydride in oil is added a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar. The contents are agitated by first shaking and then stirring until a visually uniform dispersion is attained. Then 17.8 g (0.10 mol) of the dispersion is transferred to an oven-dried 250-mL flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and, a septum-capped inlet, and an adapter connected to a pressure-relief bubbler (mercury or oil). The apparatus is purged with dry argon or nitrogen. The flask is charged with 100 mL of dry pentane or other volatile hydrocarbon solvent, and the contents are stirred thoroughly. The stirrer is stopped to allow the potassium hydride to settle, assisted by gentle tapping on the flask, and the supernatant liquid is drawn off with a double-ended needle under inert-gas pressure. This procedure is repeated twice to complete removal of the oil. Residual solvent is then removed in a stream of dry gas. To the dry potassium hydride powder is added rapidly 100 mL of dry 3-aminopropylamine. Caution! Hydrogen gas evolution. Hydrogen evolution commences immediately and subsides after 1.5–2 hr. Formation of KAPA is complete at this time.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 176 g. (1.60 moles) of diethylamine hydrochloride, 68 g. (2.26 moles) of paraformaldehyde, 600 ml. (8.2 moles) of acetone, 80 ml. of methanol, and 0.2 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is heated for 12 hours at a moderate to vigorous rate of reflux. The light-yellow solution, in which a small amount of gelatinous solid remains, is cooled, and a cold solution of 65 g. of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water is added. The mixture is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether, the combined extracts are washed with two 150-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, and the washes are re-extracted with two 150-ml. portions of ether.
B. Dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 polyether. A 1-l., stainless-steel autoclave is charged with a mixture of 125 g. (0.347 mole) of dibenzo-18-crown-6 polyether, 500 ml. of redistilled n-butanol, and 12.5 g. of 5% ruthenium-on-alumina catalyst. After the autoclave has been closed, it is flushed with nitrogen and filled with hydrogen. The mixture is hydrogenated at 100° and a hydrogen pressure of about 70 atm. (1000 p.s.i.) until the theoretical amount of hydrogen (2.08 moles) has been absorbed. The autoclave is cooled to room temperature and vented, and the reaction mixture is filtered to remove the catalyst. The filtrate is concentrated at 90–100° with a rotary evaporator, and the residual crude product solidifies on standing. To remove hydroxylic impurities, a solution of the crude product (about 130 g.) in 400 ml. of n-heptane is filtered through a 7-cm. by 20-cm. column of acid-washed alumina (80–100 mesh, activity I–II), and the column is eluted with additional n-heptane until the eluate exhibits hydroxyl absorption in the 3300–3400 cm−1 region of the IR. The solvent is removed from the combined eluates with a rotary evaporator, leaving 75–89 g. (58–69%) of mixture of diastereoisomeric dicyclohexyl-18-crown-6 polyethers as white prisms, melting within the range 38–54°, which may be used to prepare complexes with various metal salts and.
The pale yellow organic layer is dried over a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvents are removed with a rotary evaporator at ca. 40°C and the crude diketone 2 (ca. 145 g) is used directly for the next step.
To obtain a crystalline product, a solution of the residue in 30 ml. of benzene containing a few drops of triethylamine is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, heated gently on a steam bath, and diluted with 150 ml. of hexane. Heating is continued for about 5 minutes, after which the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, seeded, and put in a freezer at −15° for at least 5 hours. The resulting solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with cold hexane, and vacuum dried, giving 5.8 g. (94%) of light cream-colored crystals, m.p. 75–77°.
The lithium diisopropylamide solution prepared as described above is transferred dropwise, via a cannula, into the bicyclic lactam solution. The dry ice–acetone bath is replaced by an ice–water bath, where the reaction mixture is kept for 40 min to complete formation of the lithium enolate. The reaction mixture is cooled again (30 min) with a dry ice–acetone bath. Freshly distilled ethyl iodide (25.8 g, 13.4 mL, 165.4 mmol) is added slowly, via syringe, to the mixture and stirring is continued for 55 min in a dry ice–acetone bath. The cooling bath is replaced by an ice–water bath, and the mixture is stirred for exactly 40 min and is poured immediately into a separatory funnel containing 400 mL of 1.0 N hydrochloric acid. The resulting emulsion is extracted once with 400 mL of ether and the organic layer is washed with 200 mL of a 1 : 1 mixture of brine and a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. The ether extract is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in a 500-mL round-bottomed flask. The residue is dissolved in 60 mL of dry toluene and evaporated again using a water bath (60°C for 45 min) to remove all traces of water and toluene. The product (17.2 g, > 100%) is used in the next step without further purification.
A. Dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide. A dry, 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a drying tube, is charged with 500 ml. of anhydrous pyridine, which is stirred and cooled to approximately 15° with an ice bath. The drying tube is periodically removed and 68 g. (0.68 mole) of anhydrous chromium(VI) oxide is added in portions through the neck of the flask over a 30-minute period. The chromium trioxide should be added at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 20° and in such a manner that the oxide mixes rapidly with the pyridine and does not adhere to the side of the flask. As the chromium trioxide is added, an intensely yellow, flocculent precipitate separates from the pyridine and the viscosity of the mixture increases. When the addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. Within one hour the viscosity of the mixture decreases and the initially yellow product changes to a deep red, macrocrystalline form that settles to the bottom of the flask when stirring is discontinued. The supernatant pyridine is decanted from the complex and the crystals are washed several times by decantation with 250-ml. portions of anhydrous petroleum ether. The product is collected by filtration on a sintered glass funnel and washed with anhydrous petroleum ether, avoiding contact with the atmosphere as much as possible. The complex is dried at 10 mm. until it is free-flowing, leaving 150–160 g. (85–91%) of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide3 as red crystals. The product is extremely hygroscopic; contact with moisture converts it rapidly to the yellow dipyridinium dichromate.4 It is stored at 0° in a brown bottle.
A. (−)-Dimenthyl succinate. A 300-mL. one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a Dean–Stark trap, and a reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 20 g (0.2 mol) of succinic anhydride, 62.5 g (0.4 mol) of l-menthol, 250 mg (1.3 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 150 mL of toluene. The mixture is heated under reflux in an oil bath (about 140°C) for 24 hr. During this period the theoretical amount of water (3.6 mL) is collected. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, diluted with 200 mL of hexane, and poured into a mixture of 250 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate, 100 mL of methanol, and 200 mL of water. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 100 mL of hexane. The organic phases are combined, washed once with 200 mL of saturated brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting crude product is dissolved in 100 mL of methanol. After the solution stands in a refrigerator overnight, colorless crystals appear in the mixture and are collected by filtration with suction. This material (ca. 70 g in two crops) is purified by recrystallization from methanol to afford 66 g (84%) of pure (−)-dimenthyl succinate, mp 63–64°C.
(Caution: The sodium cyanide washes should be bottled separately and labeled appropriately for approved disposal.) The organic layer is dried (anhydrous magnesium sulfate), filtered, and concentrated to provide 16.3–20.3 g of residue. Crystallization from a 1 : 3 methylene chloride–hexane mixture at 5°C affords 13.1–16.9 g (70.4–90.7%) of beige crystals of the biphenyl, mp 215–216°C (lit.3 214–215°C) after drying under high vacuum (0.1 mm).
B. β-(o-Carboxyphenyl)propionic acid. In an open 1-l.wide-mouthed round-bottomed flask are placed 18 g. (0.094 mole) of o-carboxycinnamic acid and 550 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is warmed to 90° on a steam bath and stirred mechanically. The steam bath is then removed while 54 g. of nickel-aluminum alloy (Raney catalyst) powder is added through the open neck of the flask in small portions (from the end of a spatula) at frequent intervals. When addition of the alloy is complete (about 50 minutes), the mixture is stirred and maintained at 90–95° for 1 hour by warming on a steam bath. Distilled water is added as needed to maintain the total volume at approximately 550 ml. The hot mixture is filtered with suction, and the metallic residue is washed with 50 ml. of hot 10% sodium hydroxide solution and two 50-ml. portions of hot water in such a manner that the solid is always covered with liquid. The cooled filtrate and washings are added dropwise with mechanical stirring to 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in an open 2-l. beaker at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 80–85°. Separation of crystalline material begins almost immediately and is complete when the beaker contents have cooled to room temperature. The β-(o-carboxyphenyl)propionic acid is separated by suction filtration, washed with water, and air-dried. The yield is 16.8–17.3 g. (92–95%), m.p. 165.5–167°.
A mixture of 37 g. (0.5 mole) of dimethylcyanamide, 75 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide, and 25 ml. of water is placed in a 250-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, and glass delivery tube. The solution is stirred slowly, while hydrogen selenide is slowly bubbled in, maintaining the temperature at 20–30° by occasional external cooling. At the end of the reaction (4–5 hours) when there is no more gas evolution from the generator (4–5 hours), the flask and contents are cooled to 5–10° and stirred vigorously for one-half hour. The solid is then collected on a 9-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with 250 ml. of ice-cold 95% ethanol. The crude, gray product weighs 65–73 g. (81–91%).
B. Tributyl[(methoxymethoxy)methyl]stannane. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an argon inlet adapter, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with the (tributylstannyl)methanol prepared in the previous reaction, 190 mL of dichloromethane, 280 mL (3.16 mol) of dimethoxymethane, and 50 g of powdered 4 Å molecular sieves. Boron trifluoride etherate (13.0 mL, 0.106 mol) is added dropwise over 2 min via syringe to the vigorously stirred reaction mixture, and the resulting orange suspension is stirred at room temperature for 13 hr, and then filtered through a 2-cm pad of Celite in a sintered-glass funnel. The filter cake is washed with 250 mL of dichloromethane, and the combined filtrates are washed with two 250-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The combined aqueous layers are extracted with 250 mL of dichloromethane, and the combined organic phases are then washed with 250 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residual pale yellow oil (30 g) is dissolved in 20 mL of hexane and applied to 150 g of alumina packed in a 4.5-cm diameter column. The column is eluted with 1.3 L of 1% ethyl acetate-hexane. The total eluant is concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the residual colorless oil is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to furnish 23 g (74% overall yield based on tributyltin hydride) of tributyl[(methoxymethoxy)methyl]stannane as a colorless liquid, bp 117°C (0.34 mm) ((Note 14) and).
A. 2-(2,2-Dimethylpropanoyl)-1,3-dithiane . To 43.0 g (0.358 mol) of 1,3-dithiane at 0°C under a nitrogen atmosphere is added 396 mL of a 1 M solution of sodium hexamethyldisilazide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and. The resulting yellow solution is allowed to reach room temperature and then stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The solution is cooled to 0°C, and 172 mL of a 2.5 M solution of butyllithium in hexanes is added. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Ethyl 2,2-dimethylpropanoate (65.0 mL, 0.427 mol) is added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hr. An aqueous saturated solution of ammonium chloride (200 mL) is added, and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 200 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 100 mL of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solvents are removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. Repeated trituration with petroleum ether 40-60°C followed by filtration gives 51.0-55.1 g (70-75%) of 2-(2,2-dimethylpropanoyl)-1,3-dithiane as colorless needles, mp 97-99°C.
A. 4,6,6-Trimethyl-2-trimethylsiloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser (center neck), Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, ground-glass stopper, and rubber septum. The apparatus is connected, through the reflux condenser, to a nitrogen source and a bubbler. After the flask is flushed with nitrogen, it is charged with 150 mL of dry dimethoxyethane (DME) and 11.25 mL (80.4 mmol) of freshly distilled diisopropylamine. The flask is immersed in a methanol–ice bath and cooled to an external temperature of −15°C. Over a period of about 5 min, butyllithium, 49.8 mL (79.6 mmol), is added, with continuous stirring, with a syringe through the septum. After an additional 15 min of stirring, 10.0 g (72.4 mmol) of freshly distilled isophorone is added neat over a 10-min period. The bright-yellow solution is stirred for an additional 10 min at −15°C. At this point, 17.5 mL (137.6 mmol) of freshly distilled chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCL) is rapidly introduced through the septum. After the addition is complete (ca. 20 sec), the white slurry is stirred for an additional 2 hr at room temperature. The apparatus is then dismantled, the two outside necks of the flask are stoppered with ground-glass stoppers, and the center neck is attached to a rotary evaporator. Solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is treated with 100 mL of pentane. The slurry is filtered through a sintered-glass filter and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to give 13.5–13.9 g (88–91%) of pure 4,6,6-trimethyl-2-trimethylsiloxycyclohexa-1,3-diene, bp 54–57°C (1.5 mm), 37–39°C (0.01 mm) [lit.2 bp 45–49°C (0.05 mm)].
A 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, fitted with a propeller-type stirrer and a thermometer, is set in an oil bath. A mixture of 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 10 ml. of water is placed in the flask, the oil bath is heated to 120°, and the cold sulfuric acid solution of the chloramine is allowed to flow into the heated acid from the short-stemmed separatory funnel. The addition, which requires 30–40 minutes, is carried out at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture in the flask is dropped from 120° rapidly to 95° by the addition of the cold chloramine solution, and thereafter at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 90–100°, preferably at 95°. The reaction is exothermic, and the rise in temperature is controlled by the addition of the cold chloramine solution. To avoid an undue rise in temperature after the last addition of the chloramine, the oil bath is removed, and the flask and contents are allowed to come to room temperature.
The copper sulfate-pyridine mixture is readily reoxidized by passing a current of air through it for thirty-six hours. To this resulting solution is now added 200 g. of pyridine and it is then used for oxidizing another 1696 g. portion of benzoin.
A. 1,1,2-Trichloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutane. In a 1-l. rocker bomb are placed 350 g. (3.6 moles) of 1,1-dichloroethylene are 1 g. of hydroquinone. The bomb is cooled in a mixture of Dry Ice and acetone and evacuated. The vacuum is released with nitrogen and the bomb is again evacuated. The bomb is then charged with 300 g. (2.6 moles) of chlorotrifluoroethylene from a cylinder. The bomb is heated at 180° for 7 hours behind a barricade and is then cooled, vented, and unloaded. The solid polymer (about 45 g.) is removed by filtration and is rinsed with 50 ml. of ether. The combined filtrate and rinse are concentrated and then distilled through a 30-cm. packed column to give 242–262 g. (44–48%) of 1,1,2-trichloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutane, b.p. 120–121°, n25D 1.4139–1.4141.
A. O-(Trimethylsilyl)benzophenone cyanohydrin. A 250-mL, one-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and drying tube is charged with 22.0 g (0.12 mol) of benzophenone, 13.9 g (0.14 mol) of trimethylsilyl cyanide, 600 mg (1.9 mmol) of anhydrous zinc iodide, and 50 mL of dry methylene chloride. The solution is heated at 65°C in an oil bath for 2 hr and. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to yield 36.4–37.9 g of crude product, which is used in the next step without purification.
The filtrate and the washings contain in solution a small quantity of the product. This is recovered by distillation with steam. The acid distillate consists of snow-white crystals (if it is protected from light) and a solution of the compound. The solid is removed by filtration and washed. The filtrate is made neutral with sodium carbonate and extracted with ether. Upon drying and evaporating, the ethereal layer yields mononitrothiophene contaminated with dinitrothiophene.
Meanwhile, a 1-L, three-necked, foil-wrapped, round-bottomed flask is charged with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS, 7.45 g, 41.9 mmol, 2.5 equiv) and equipped with an internal thermometer, 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar and two rubber septa (one pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The flask is charged with 35 mL of THF via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to −70 °C or colder using a dry ice/acetone bath. The room temperature silane solution is added into the cold NBS solution via cannula such that the internal temperature does not exceed −50 °C. After the addition is complete the resulting mixture is stirred for a further 30 min at -70 °C or colder. One septum is removed and the cold mixture is slowly poured into a 1-L round-bottomed flask containing a 300-mL solution of rapidly stirring half-saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The heterogeneous mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the flask is rinsed with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed successively with 100 mL of half-saturated aqueous Na2S2O3, 200 mL of water, 200 mL of brine, then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (7 g) and quickly filtered through a thin pad of silica into a foil wrapped 500-mL single-necked flask. The yellow solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 40 mmHg) and then at 1.5 mmHg for 1 h to give approximately 17 g of crude material (quantitative mass recovery based on both naphthalene and dibromosilole 2). 1H NMR analysis of a representative sample typically shows a 1:5.2 mixture of the dibromosilole (2) and naphthalene, which corresponds to a 96% yield (6.78 g) of useable dibromosilole (2). It is generally unnecessary to remove the naphthalene for subsequent use, such as cross coupling reactions.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, and cooled externally with an ice-salt bath, is placed a solution of 118 g. (1.8 moles) of U.S.P. 85% potassium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water. The temperature of the solution is maintained between 0° and 10° (with the addition of ice to the flask if necessary) while 247 g. (205 ml., 2.0 moles) of 1-chloro-1-nitropropane is added from a dropping funnel over a 20-minute period. The cooling bath is removed, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added dropwise until the momentary green coloration produced by the addition of each drop of acid spreads rapidly throughout the solution (near a pH of 9). The temperature of the solution rises to about 70° with the separation of a deep-green oily layer. Stirring is continued until the reaction mixture reaches room temperature (about 3 hours).
The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is distilled under nitrogen through a spinning band column and. The fraction, boiling at 92–93° (725 mm.), is collected, yielding 54.2–60.0 g. (66–73%, based on chloroform) of tert-butyl isocyanide and.
The organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the almost-colorless residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 10-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 37–42 g. (79–90%) of the β-hydroxy ester as a colorless liquid, b.p. 77–80° (1 mm.); nD24 1.4555–1.4557.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, are placed 680 g. (2.3 moles) of sodium dichromate, 1500 cc. of water, and 230 g. (1.7 moles) of p-nitrotoluene. Stirring is started, and 1700 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid is allowed to flow in during about thirty minutes. The heat of dilution of the sulfuric acid will cause the nitrotoluene to melt, and rapid oxidation will soon take place. The last half of the sulfuric acid must be added gradually, in order to prevent too violent a reaction. Since a small amount of nitrotoluene is volatilized, it is advisable to carry on this work under a hood.
The resulting mixture is allowed to stand in the ice-salt bath until it separates into layers, and the liquid layers are decanted from the sodium sulfate into a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer is removed and the butyl nitrite layer washed twice with 50-cc. portions of a solution containing 2 g. of sodium bicarbonate and 25 g. of sodium chloride in 100 cc. of water. After drying over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the yield of practically pure butyl nitrite amounts to 420–440 g. (81–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) and. If desired, the product may be distilled under reduced pressure when 98 per cent distils at 24–27°/43 mm.. Butyl nitrite boils at 75° under atmospheric pressure, with some decomposition.
The combined filtrate and washings are transferred to a 400-cc. beaker, allowed to cool slowly without agitation until crystal formation appears complete, then cooled to 5°. The crystalline ammonium salt is then removed by suction filtration on a large Büchner funnel, washed with 15 cc. of ice water, sucked as dry as possible, and spread in a thin layer on an enameled or glass tray and allowed to dry in air at 35–50°. The yield of yellow to violet ammonium salt is 80–89 g., representing a recovery of 76–84 per cent and.
(A) Creatinine.—A mixture of 900 g. (6 moles) of commercial creatine hydrate with 550 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 150 cc. of water is warmed in a 3-l. flask on the steam bath for twenty-four hours. The hot solution is filtered and chilled to 0–5° in an ice bath, and to it is added 1 l. of 28 per cent aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath, and the mixture is stirred vigorously until the temperature falls to 0°, when the crystalline creatinine is filtered off, washed with ice-cold 28 per cent aqueous ammonia until the filtrate is free of chlorides, and finally with ice-cold methyl alcohol; the product is then dried to constant weight at 40–50°. The yield is 545–555 g. (80–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a dry-nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser, and a septum is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 20.6 g (50 mmol) of 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide and 100 mL of anhydrous ether. The mixture is brought to reflux with a heat gun. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained over the reaction mixture during this and the ensuing steps. When the 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-D-glucopyranosyl bromide dissolves, 13.5 g (250 mmol) of acrylonitrile and 16.0 g (55 mmol) of tributyltin hydride are added by means of a syringe. The refluxing solution is irradiated with a sunlamp positioned 2.5–3.8 cm from the reaction flask. The heat from the sunlamp maintains a vigorous reflux. After 4 hr, the irradiation is stopped and the reaction mixture is cooled and filtered to collect the precipitated crystals. The filtrate is reintroduced under nitrogen into the reaction vessel. An additional 6.6 g (120 mmol) of acrylonitrile and 5.8 g (20 mmol) of tributyltin hydride are added and irradiation is resumed for another 4 hr until the starting bromide is completely reacted. After the reaction mixture is cooled, it is filtered, the filtrate is saved, and the filter cake is combined with the crystals collected above. The solids are stirred with 250 mL of hot isopropyl alcohol and filtered. The hot filtrate is concentrated to a total volume of 75 mL, allowed to cool and filtered to give 7.8–8.6 g (40–45%) of 1-deoxy-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-(2-cyanoethyl)-α-D-glucopyranose as long, colorless crystals, mp 121–122°C, [α]D25 +66.2 (CHCl3, c 0.7). The isopropyl alcohol mother liquor is set aside. The above filtrate from the crude reaction mixture is concentrated, taken up in 50 mL of acetonitrile, and extracted 3 times with 50-mL portions of pentane. The acetonitrile phase is combined with the isopropyl alcohol mother liquor and concentrated. The resulting syrup is flash-chromatographed on silica gel using ethyl acetate/hexane (1 : 1) eluent to afford an additional 2.2–2.5 g of pure 1-deoxy-2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-1-(2-cyanoethyl)-α-D-glucopyranose after separation of by-products and. The combined yield of pure product is 53–56%

Vol. I, 1941, 252) dissolved in 100 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The flask is placed in ice, and 159.8 g. (51.2 cc., 1 mole) of bromine is added in small quantities with frequent stirring.
A. 2-Iodo-2-cyclohexen-1-one . A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 1.5-in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, glass stopper, 50-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser is charged with a 1:1 mixture of 75 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether and 75 mL of pyridine . With vigorous stirring, 53 g (0.21 mol) of iodine is added slowly. At the completion of the addition, the dark brown mixture is stirred an additional 10-20 min until complete dissolution is obtained.
A. 1,2-Benzenedimethanol. An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for mechanical stirring, and outfitted with a reflux condenser bearing an argon inlet/outlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, and a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, is placed under an argon atmosphere and charged with 20.94 g (0.552 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4), and 850 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether and. A solution of 87.46 mL (97.78 g, 0.44 mol) of diethyl phthalate in 170 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 1.5 hr with efficient mechanical stirring, at a rate of addition adjusted to maintain a gentle reflux. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated to reflux by means of a heating mantle for 1.5 hr. The mechanically stirred reaction mixture is then cooled to ~0°C in an ice-water bath, and quenched by cautious sequential addition of 21 mL of water, 21 mL of aqueous 15% sodium hydroxide solution, and 63 mL of water. While stirring is continued, the mixture is held for 30 min at 0°C then allowed to warm to room temperature. The resulting white solids are collected by vacuum filtration and washed on the filter using a total of 1 L of ether in 100-mL portions. Concentration of the filtrate, under reduced pressure, affords 56.64 g (93%) of 1,2-benzenedimethanol as a white solid, mp 62–64°C, which is sufficiently pure for further transformation.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 2 kg. (15.9 moles) of pure crystallized oxalic acid which has been passed through a 10-mesh sieve, and 3 l. of carbon tetrachloride. The flask is then fitted with a mechanical stirrer and the apparatus shown in Fig. 22.
This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The chief impurities are small amounts of inorganic salts and a trace of the unreduced nitro compound. If a purer product is desired the crude material (5 g. per 100 ml.) is dissolved in hot 3 N hydrochloric acid, decolorizing carbon is added, the solution is filtered promptly, and the filtrate is made just faintly acid to Congo red paper with concentrated ammonium hydroxide. After the mixture has cooled to room temperature the pale yellow flocculent precipitate is separated by filtration, washed well with cold water, and dried in the oven at 100° or below. The recovery in the crystallization is 70–75%, and the product melts at 329–332°.
B. 3,5-Di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical overhead stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer is charged with 125 g (0.60 mol) of 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol , 170 g (1.20 mol, 2 eq) of hexamethylenetetramine , and 300 mL of glacial acetic acid. Complete dissolution results within minutes after stirring is initiated. The reaction mixture is heated to 130°C over a period of 60 min or less, and the temperature is diligently maintained within a range of 125-135°C for 2 hr as stirring is continued. The reaction mixture is then cooled to 75-80°C and aqueous sulfuric acid [300 mL of 33% (w/w)] is added with stirring while the temperature is maintained below 100°C. After the resulting mixture is heated to reflux (105-110°C) for 30-60 min, the reaction mixture is cooled to 75-80°C and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel wrapped with electrical heating tape. The phases are allowed to separate while the temperature is maintained at 75-80°C; the lower aqueous phase (650 to 750 mL; pH 4-5) is drawn off. The organic layer is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and cooled to 50°C, at which point methanol (100 mL) is added with stirring. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, then to ≤5°C with an ice bath and maintained at that temperature for 1 hr with continued stirring. The product is collected by vacuum filtration and the solid is washed with 30 mL of cold (≤5°C) methanol . Air is pulled through the filter cake for not less than 30 min to remove most of the solvent. The crude product is suspended in methanol (approximately 1:1; w/v) and the mixture is heated to 50-55°C for 30 min with stirring. The solution is cooled to ≤5°C over a 1-hr period and this temperature is maintained for another hour. The product is collected by vacuum filtration and washed with 20 mL of cold methanol . The product is allowed to air dry and is isolated as a free-flowing yellow solid, mp ≥52°C and.
As soon as the temperature drops to 110–120°, 400 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution is added carefully through the condenser, and the mixture is shaken vigorously. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the product is collected on a Büchner funnel. The solid, when dry, is slightly colored, and weighs 57–64 g., m.p. 85–91°.
The combined alcohol extract is distilled under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask by heating on a water bath. All the solvent is thus recovered for use in a subsequent preparation.
B. 3,3-Dimethyl-1,5-diphenylpentane-1,5-dione. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a rubber septum, and a two-way stopcock equipped with a balloon of argon gas. To the flask is added 100 mL of dry methylene chloride, and the flask is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath. Titanium tetrachloride (7.7 mL) is added by syringe through the septum. The septum is removed and replaced with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of 11.2 g of isopropylideneacetophenone in 30 mL of methylene chloride. This solution is added over a 3-min period, and the mixture is stirred for 4 min. A solution of 13.5 g of the silyl enol ether of acetophenone in 40 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a 4-min period, and the mixture is stirred for 7 min. The reaction mixture is poured into a solution of 22 g of sodium carbonate in 160 mL of water with vigorous magnetic stirring. The resulting white precipitate is removed by filtration through a Celite pad and the precipitate is washed with methylene chloride.
B. β-Ethyl-β-methylglutaric acid. A mixture of 280 g. (1.36 moles) of α,α'-dicyano-β-ethyl-β-methylglutarimide and 1.35 l. of 65% (by weight) sulfuric acid is heated under reflux in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask for 8–10 hours. The mixture is allowed to cool, and the precipitate is removed by filtration on a sintered glass (or other suitable type) filter. The crude β-ethyl-β-methylglutaric acid is recrystallized from water. The yield of product is 174–191 g. (73–80%), m.p. 78–80°.
B. Butylboronic acid . To a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer and an internal thermocouple probe is added 220 mL of ether, followed by 10 mL (89.2 mmol) of trimethyl borate. The clear solution is cooled to −75°C (internal temperature) and stirred vigorously, then 45 mL (87.8 mmol) of a 1.95 M solution of butylmagnesium bromide in ether is added dropwise via cannula at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed −65°C. After the addition is complete, the resulting white slurry is stirred for an additional 2 hr at −75°C under argon. The cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Hydrolysis is carried out by the dropwise addition of 100 mL of an aqueous 10% solution of hydrochloric acid . The white precipitate is dissolved, and the resulting clear biphasic mixture is stirred for 15 min, at which time the two layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (2 × 50 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate . After concentration of the ethereal solution under reduced pressure, the residual white solid is purified by recrystallization as follows: After dissolution in hot water (25 mL), the resulting biphasic solution is cooled to 0°C to induce recrystallization of the boronic acid. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 50 mL of hexanes and placed under vacuum (0.2 mm) for 60 min and. Between 5.0-6.5 g (55-72% yield) of the boronic acid is produced as a white solid.
One hundred grams (0.68 mole) of phthalic anhydride and 400 g. (462 cc., 4.35 moles) of toluene are placed in the flask, which is cooled in an ice bath while 200 g. (1.5 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is being ground to a fine powder. The chloride is now added all at once. Stirring is commenced at once, and the ice bath is removed. The mixture warms up considerably and becomes olive-green in color. When the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins to slacken (ten minutes) a water bath is put into place and heated to 90° in the course of forty-five minutes. The temperature of the bath is kept at 90° and vigorous stirring continued for two and one-half hours. At this point, the evolution of hydrogen chloride will have practically ceased and the reaction will have been completed. The hot water in the bath is replaced first by cold water and then by ice, while stirring is continued.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, preferably fitted with an interchangeable ground-glass joint, are placed 650 g. (820 ml.) of absolute tert-butyl alcohol and 39.1 g. (1 gram atom) of potassium. A reflux condenser is attached to the flask and the mixture is refluxed until all the potassium is dissolved (about 8 hours). The solution is allowed to cool slightly, and 198 g. (1 mole) of bromoacetal, together with some boiling chips is quickly added. A cream-colored precipitate of potassium bromide begins to deposit immediately. The flask is attached at once to a closely indented 46-cm. Vigreux column, equipped with a glass insulating jacket and a total-reflux partial take-off still head1, and the tert-butyl alcohol is distilled from an oil bath (about 120–130°) at the rate of 25 drops per minute with a reflux ratio at the still head of about 6:1. This operation requires 16–18 hours, and at the end of this time the temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160° and maintained there until no more alcohol comes over. The bath is then lowered and allowed to cool while the pressure within the fractionating system is very gradually reduced to 200 mm. and held there by a barostat.
B. (5S)-(d-Menthyloxy)-2(5H)-furanone. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 10-mL Dean-Stark trap, and reflux condenser is charged with d-menthol (51.9 g, 0.330 mol), 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone (37.3 g, 0.370 mol), D-(+)-camphorsulfonic acid (3.96 g, 0.170 mol), and 190 mL of dry benzene. The stirred suspension is heated to reflux under argon with an oil bath preheated to 100°C. After 1-2 hr, a total of 5.1 mL of water is collected and no residual menthol is apparent by TLC analysis. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and treated carefully with 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. After completion of the addition, stirring is maintained for 90 min as the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The product is extracted with dichloromethane (300 mL) and the organic phase is washed with three 70-mL portions of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide 66.7 g (85%) of a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the menthyloxybutenolides. This mixture is dissolved in 400 mL of hot petroleum ether (bp 35-60°C) and subsequently cooled to room temperature and eventually to −10°C. Two additional recrystallizations from petroleum ether (200 mL on each occasion) with slow cooling affords 10.7-17.33 g (14-22%) of pure (5S)-(d-menthyloxy)-2(5H)-furanone, mp 79-80°C.
The crude product is purified by passing it through a column (4.5 cm × 30 cm) of neutral alumina using chloroform as eluant. The desired product moves with the solvent front, and the first 300–350 mL of eluant contains all of the product. Removal of the solvent gives 4.96 g. The product, which contains a small amount of tert-butyl alcohol, can be further purified by distillation through a short-path apparatus to give 4.6 g (90%) of pure O-ester, bp 91°C (25 mm) and.
The arsanilic acid can be obtained from the aqueous alkaline solution either as the free acid or as the sodium salt. To obtain the free acid the solution is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid until the purple color of tetrabromophenolsulfonphthalein is changed to a faint yellow. Care should be taken in the addition of the acid not to overstep the end-point. Crystallization is stimulated by scratching, and the flask is allowed to stand overnight to complete the precipitation. The crystals of pinkish-yellow acid are filtered off, digested with 340 cc. of ethyl alcohol, filtered, and recrystallized from 2.5 l. of boiling water, adding 5–6 g. of Norite and filtering hot. This crystallization always produces a white product. The yield of thoroughly dry arsanilic acid is 147–184 g. (10.9–14.5 per cent of the theoretical amount), and.
C. Bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one. A magnetic stirring bar is placed in a 300-ml., round-bottomed flask and 100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added Stirring is begun, the flask is cooled in an ice bath, and 9.0 g. (0.63 mole) of 3-chlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred, allowed to warm slowly over 4 hours to room temperature, then stirred overnight. The resulting solution is poured onto 200 g. of ice with stirring. After the ice has melted, the mixture is shaken with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether layers are combined, washed once with 50 ml. of water, and dried over 10 g. of magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by careful distillation, and the crude product is sublimed at a bath temperature of 70° (15 mm.) directly onto a cold finger inserted into the flask. The crude product is twice sublimed, yielding 5.9–6.3 g. (75–81%) of bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-3-one, m.p. 137°, 98% pure by analysis,, and.
B. (2S, 3R)-2,4-Dimethyl-1,3-pentanediol 3 . To a stirred solution of (+)-2 (2.75 g, 5 mmol, 96 : 4 isomeric purity) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (50 mL) is added lithium aluminum hydride (0.19 g, 5 mmol) at 0°C. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr and quenched by the careful addition of sodium sulfate decahydrate (5 g). The mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated, dissolved in 75 mL of a 1:1 mixture of hexane and dichloromethane . This solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. Trituration of the resulting oil with hexane (50 ml) results in the precipitation of auxiliary alcohol 4 (1.6-1.8 g) which is recovered by filtration. The residue is separated by chromatography over silica gel (40 g) with hexane and ethyl acetate (3:1-1:1) to afford additional 4 (0.2-0.4 g, Note 12) and 3 (0.60 g, 92%).

Ether, 100 mL and 50 mL of dichloromethane are added, followed by about 10 g of molecular sieves 3Å. The resulting heterogeneous solution is stirred for 2 hr under argon. The solid is triturated with dichloromethane (50 mL), filtered through a medium fritted disk funnel and washed with dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to produce the crude desired complex. The diethanolamine complex is purified by recrystallization as follows: the white solid is dissolved in hot dichloromethane (20 mL), then ether (50 mL) is added to induce recrystallization of the complex. The mixture is cooled to 0°C and the solid is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with ether (2 × 30 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) to afford 7.70 g (89%) of the title compound as a white crystalline solid.
C. Preparation of hexafluoroacetylacetonate[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclo-butadiene)cobalt]palladium (COP-hfacac). A single-necked, 25-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stir bar and charged with [COP-OAc]2 (1.0 g, 0.66 mmol), sodium hexafluoroacetylacetonate (1.6 g, 6.8 mmol), 6.6 mL of acetone and 3.3 mL of water. The mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature. After 9 h, the mixture is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with 10–20 mL of water and then dried over P2O5 in a vacuum dessicator for 12 h to provide 1.1 g (1.2 mmol, 91%) of hexafluoroacetylacetonate[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)-cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt]-palladium, COP-hfacac, as an orange solid.
A. p-Methoxyphenyllead triacetate. A 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 50 g (0.11 mol) of lead tetraacetate, chloroform (200 mL), and 140 g (1.09 mol) of dichloroacetic acid. To this solution is added 16 g (0.15 mol) of anisole, and the mixture is stirred at 25°C until lead tetraacetate can no longer be detected. The reaction mixture is washed with water (2 × 250 mL) and the chloroform solution is treated with 1.5 L of hexane. The yellow precipitate (44 g) is collected by suction filtration and stirred with a mixture of glacial acetic acid (250 mL) and chloroform (200 mL) for 1 hr.
B. 9-[2-(3-Cyclohexenyl)ethyl]-9-BBN. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped with a rubber septum. The apparatus is connected through the condenser to a nitrogen source and an oil bubbler and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 35 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 8.32 g (77.0 mmol) of 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene and cooled to 0°C. A 0.5 M solution of 9-BBN (9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) in tetrahydrofuran (154 mL, 77.0 mmol) is transferred via cannula to the addition funnel and is added dropwise with stirring over 1 hr maintaining the temperature at 0–5°C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at 0°C and for 1.5 hr at room temperature. The solution obtained is used in the next step without further treatment.
B. Nα-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-β-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine.2,3,5 6 7 A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum and an argon inlet. The flask is charged with N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone (15 g, 68 mmol) and anhydrous acetonitrile (240 mL,). The cloudy mixture is stirred and solid pyrazole (4.9 g, 72 mmol) is added. The rubber septum is quickly replaced with a reflux condenser and an argon inlet adaptor, and the reaction mixture is heated in an oil bath at 52–54°C for 24 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to leave a white solid that is dried under vacuum for 30 min. Sodium hydroxide (1 N, 69 mL) is added, the suspension is diluted with distilled water (350 mL) and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min. It is then extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL) to remove unreacted pyrazole and side products. The aqueous phase is cooled in an ice bath to ca. 4°C, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added with stirring to bring the pH to 1 (about 10 mL required). The resulting precipitate is filtered, washed with water (ca. 75 mL), air dried, and then completely dried in a desiccator over phosphorus oxide (P2O5) at 0.2 mm for 12 hr. This material is recrystallized from ethyl acetate (350 mL) to give 7.3 g of pure product (37% yield). Concentration of the mother liquor on a rotary evaporator and recrystallization from the minimum volume of ethyl acetate gives an additional 1.1 g of analytically pure Nα-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-β-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine. The total yield is 8.4 g (43%).
A 5-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and an inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask. In the flask is placed a mixture of 238 g. (1.3 moles) of 2,4-dinitroaniline, 2.4 l. of 95% ethanol, and 1.2 l. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90).
This hydrogenation experiment is repeated twice with the remaining two-thirds of the "pure" tridehydro[18]annulene solution, and the combined filtrates from the three hydrogenations are evaporated to approximately 30 ml.. The solution is then transferred with a pipette to a test tube (10 × 3 cm.) and concentrated to approximately 15 ml. at 40° with a stream of nitrogen. The dark green solution is diluted with 20 ml. of ether and cooled in an ice bath for 30 minutes. The resulting red-brown crystals of [18]annulene are collected by filtration on a sintered glass funnel and washed with approximately 3 ml. of cold (−20°) ether. After drying in air for a few minutes this material weighs 114 mg. A second crop weighing 42 mg. is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquors to dryness, followed by crystallization from 6 ml. of benzene and 20 ml. of ether. Both crops give a single spot on TLC.
As soon as the flask is well cooled, it is disconnected and carried to the hood, and ice is slowly added, with shaking, until the dark mass is completely decomposed and the flask is about one-half filled with the mixture. After 150 cc. of crude concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added, the mass coagulates and the solution clears; the flask is then heated on the steam bath while preparations are being made for steam distillation.
The crude product is suspended in 200 cc. of water, and 40 g. of solid sodium bicarbonate is added. The resulting solution is filtered by gravity, then boiled with 0.1 g. of Norite. The mixture is filtered and the yellowish-brown filtrate is acidified while still hot with an excess of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The precipitated diphenic acid is collected on a filter and washed with 40 cc. of cold water. When dried at 100° the product melts at 225–228° and weighs 32–37 g. (72–84 per cent of the theoretical amount). It is a light cream color.
B. 2-(4'-Methylphenyl)-pyridine. A three-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, a thermometer, a glass stopper and a magnetic stirrer (egg shaped, 3 × 1.5 cm) is charged with 2-(4'-methylphenyl)-pyridine N-oxide (5.98 g, 32.3 mmol, 1 equiv). Tetrahydrofuran (120 mL) is added, followed by saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (120 mL). This addition caused a slight increase of the reaction temperature from 22 °C up to 28 °C, and a white solid is formed in the aqueous layer. Zinc dust is added in 4 portions (10.6 g, 161 mmol, 5 equiv) within 10 min under stirring (700 rpm) to this biphasic mixture. Again, an increase of the reaction temperature from 25 °C up to 38 °C over a period of 15 min is observed. The reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min until TLC analysis reveals complete consumption of the starting material. The mixture is filtered through a Celite® pad and is washed with MTBE (250 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is back-extracted with MTBE (125 mL) using a second 250-mL separatory funnel. The organic layers are consecutively washed with half-saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (125 mL) and with brine (125 mL). The combined organic layers are then dried over MgSO4 (3 g), filtered and concentrated (40 °C, 250 mmHg) to afford the title compound as yellow liquid (5.47 g, 32.3 mmol, 100%). Purification by Kugelrohr distillation (150 °C, 0.3 mmHg) gives the title compound as a colorless liquid (5.35 g, 31.6 mmol, 98%).
A 2-l. three-necked flask is thoroughly dried and fitted with a large dry-ice condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, and a powder funnel in an efficient hood. With nitrogen flowing through the system, 62.5 g. (1.60 moles) of commercial sodium amide is added rapidly. (Caution! Sodium amide is corrosive and readily decomposes in the presence of moisture.) The funnel is replaced by a gas-inlet tube, the condenser is filled with a mixture of dry ice and acetone, and ca. 400 ml. of liquid ammonia is introduced from a cylinder. The gas-inlet tube is replaced by an addition funnel, stirring is commenced, and 66.3 g. (0.400 mole) of o-chlorohydrocinnamonitrile is added over a 10-minute period. The last traces of the nitrile are washed into the flask with small amounts of anhydrous ether.
The organic layer is separated from the drying agent and distilled from a few fresh pellets of potassium hydroxide through a column of the Whitmore-Fenske type. After a 3- to 5-g. fore-run, the product distils at 71–72°; the yield is 36–41 g. (45–51%) and.
B. Methyl 7-oxoheptanoate. In the same three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 72–78 g. (0.21–0.23 mole) of disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate, the gas-dispersion tube is replaced with a mechanical stirrer, and 1.5 l. of dry, deoxygenated tetrahydrofuran is added. The light tan suspension is stirred vigorously as 41.8 g. (0.200 mole) of methyl 6-bromohexanoate is added in one portion by syringe. The nitrogen is flushed from the flask with carbon monoxide and admitted through the other branch of the three-way stopcock, and the suspension is stirred under 10 p.s.i. of carbon monoxide for at least 14 hours, during which time the solid dissolves. A rapid flow of nitrogen is swept through the flask while the septum is removed and replaced quickly with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid, added dropwise to the orange solution. Stirring is continued for 20 minutes, after which the deep red solution is concentrated to a volume of ca. 400 ml. with a rotary evaporator in the hood (Caution! Some iron pentacarbonyl is present) and poured into 2 l. of water. The mixture is extracted with four 400-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic solutions are washed with 400 ml. of water. The ethereal solution is mixed with 400 ml. of 2 M hydrochloric acid, and 68 g. of iron(III) chloride is added in small portions until carbon monoxide evolution subsides and the organic layer becomes green from triiron dodecacarbonyl. The organic layer is washed with successive 400-ml. portions of 2 M hydrochloric acid, water, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and saturated sodium chloride. After being dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the ethereal solution is concentrated to a green oil with a rotary evaporator. Iron-containing by-products such as triiron dodecacarbonyl and iron pentacarbonyl are removed by rapid chromatography on a 7 × 40 cm. column prepared in hexane with 400 g. of silica gel. The green triiron dodecacarbonyl is first eluted with ca. 3 l. of hexane before the product is eluted with 3 l. of 2:1 (v/v) ether–hexane. The ether–hexane eluate is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated. Distillation of the residual oil through a 15-cm. Vigreux column at reduced pressure affords a small forerun of 1 ml. or less and 17.9–20.0 g. (57–63%) of methyl 7-oxoheptanoate, b.p. 65–80° (0.1 mm.), n20D 1.4388.
The residual solution is then transferred to a 2-l. beaker, a solution of 50 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 100 cc. of water and a little decolorizing carbon are added, and the mixture is boiled until the odor of ammonia is completely absent. The solution is filtered by suction, diluted to 500 cc. with water, and transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and cooled by running water. While stirring and cooling below 30°, 150 g. (1.1 moles) of benzoyl chloride and a cold solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water are admitted separately from separatory funnels at such rates that the solution is always only slightly alkaline. About an hour is required for adding the reagents, and the mixture is stirred for a half hour longer. It is then poured into 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 2-l. beaker, and, after cooling, the precipitate is filtered and dried. The weight at this point is 150–160 g. The solid is placed in a beaker with 300 cc. of technical carbon tetrachloride, the beaker is covered with a watch glass, and the mixture is boiled gently for ten minutes. The mixture is then cooled slightly, filtered by gentle suction, and the hippuric acid washed on the filter with 50 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. After drying, it weighs 135–140 g. For final purification the acid is dissolved in about 2 l. of boiling water, filtered through a steam-heated funnel and allowed to crystallize without artificial cooling. It then appears in characteristic white needles melting at 186–187°. The yield is 115–122 g. (64–68 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid used). Upon concentrating the mother liquor to 200 cc., a further 6–7 g. of slightly brown hippuric acid is obtained.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 200 g. of technical flake sodium hydroxide, 200 g. of benzophenone, 2 l. of 95 per cent alcohol, and 200 g. of technical zinc dust. The stirrer is started and the mixture slowly warms to about 70° spontaneously. After two to three hours the mixture, which has started to cool, is filtered with suction, and the residue is washed twice with 100-cc. portions of hot alcohol.
In a dry 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed stirrer, a 500-cc. dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser protected at the top with a calcium chloride tube, is placed 400 cc. of absolute alcohol. Through the condenser tube is added 23 g. (1 gram atom) of clean sodium at such a rate that the solution is kept at the boiling temperature. After the sodium has dissolved completely, 170 g. (1.06 moles) of ethyl malonate is added, and then 100 g. (1.02 moles) of mesityl oxide is added slowly through the dropping funnel. The solution is refluxed with constant stirring for two hours, after which a solution of 125 g. (2.2 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 575 cc. of water is added and the mixture is stirred and refluxed again on the water bath for six hours.
A. N-n-Heptylurea. To a mixture of 24.1 g. (0.21 mole) of n-heptylamine, 35 g. of cracked ice, and 150 ml. of ice-cold water is added 38 ml. of 5N hydrochloric acid with stirring. The mixture is heated on the steam bath at 70–80°, and 14.3 g. (0.22 mole) of sodium cyanate is added portion-wise. After 2–4 hours of continued heating, two layers separate. The product crystallizes on standing overnight at room temperature. It is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 100 ml. of cold water, and drained as dry as practical by suction. This solid is dissolved in 125 ml. of boiling ethyl acetate, and the resulting solution is cooled to room temperature. The white crystalline N-n-heptylurea is filtered and dried on a porcelain plate at room temperature. A yield of 28.5–29.5 g. (86–88%) of product melting at 110–111° is obtained.
The combined ether solutions are then subjected to distillation at 20°or below under the vacuum obtainable from a water pump until all the ether is removed. Prolonged distillation results in decomposition of the diazo ester and in a decreased yield. The yellow residual oil is practically pure ethyl diazoacetate and is satisfactory for most synthetic purposes. The yield is about 98 g. (85%) and.
C. 3-Acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinone. A 3-L, four-necked flask is equipped with a reflux condenser topped with a gas discharge tube, thermometer, fritted-glass inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask, and a glass sleeve for accepting an ultraviolet (UV) lamp. The reaction vessel is charged with 258 g (2.0 mol) of 3-acetyl-2-oxazolidinone, 2 L of carbon tetrachloride, and several boiling chips. The mixture is heated to gentle reflux, the light source is turned on, and 155 g (2.18 mol) of chlorine gas is introduced at such a rate that no chlorine escapes from the condenser. After the addition is complete, heating is discontinued and nitrogen is bubbled through the reaction mixture to remove the dissolved hydrogen chloride. The solvent is then removed on a rotary evaporator to give a yellow oil, which consists of a mixture of 3-acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinones3 and is used in Step D without further purification.
A solution of 315 g. (4.76 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 3150 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol is prepared with mechanical stirring in a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask. The flask is fitted with a 500-ml. dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask, and hydrogen sulfide is passed in through the inlet tube with stirring until the solution is saturated and no longer gives an alkaline reaction with phenolphthalein,. The mixture is cooled to 10–15° by means of an ice bath, and 346.5 g. (2.46 moles) of redistilled benzoyl chloride is introduced dropwise with stirring while the temperature is kept below 15°. The potassium chloride which precipitates during the addition is separated by filtration with suction through a Büchner funnel and is washed with about 200 ml. of ethanol. The filtrate and washings are cooled to 10–15°, and solid iodine is added slowly, with constant agitation, until a slight excess is present, as shown by a faint permanent coloration of the solution. The amount of iodine required varies from 336 g. to 407 g. (1.32–1.61 moles). Benzoyl disulfide precipitates during the addition. It is collected on a filter and washed with 750 ml. of 95% ethanol followed by 3 l. of water. The crude product, after drying at room temperature, or in an oven at a temperature which does not exceed 60°, weighs 325–333 g.
B. Ethyl (E,Z)-2,4-decadienoate (2). A dry, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 50 g of aluminum oxide and heated at 200°C for 2 hr under reduced pressure (0.05 mm). The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen line and a heavy magnetic stirring bar is added; the flask is flushed with nitrogen. With positive nitrogen pressure, the flask is charged with 200 mL of benzene and 15.4–17.2 g (78–88 mmol) of allenic ester 1. The mixture is heated at reflux temperature with vigorous stirring for 5 hr. The aluminum oxide is removed by filtration with suction through a sintered-glass funnel of medium porosity and thoroughly washed with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator to afford 11.6–13.6 g (75–88%) of nearly pure 2 as a clean oil and, bp 83–88°C (0.1 mm).
B. (3-Methyl-2-butenyl)(2-propynyl)propanedioic acid, dimethyl ester (2). To a 1-L, flame-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and under an argon atmosphere, is added 9.0 g (0.19 mol) of sodium hydride dispersion. The sodium hydride is washed with petroleum ether (4 × 30 mL), removing the petroleum ether by pipette after the sodium hydride has settled. The flask is then fitted with a thermometer and an over-dried pressure-equalizing addition funnel and charged with 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The heterogenous mixture is cooled with an ice bath, and 36.4 g (0.18 mol) of the monoalkyl diester (1) is added dropwise at the rate of 1 drop/2–3 sec. The cooling bath is removed when the addition is complete, and the solution is stirred until no more gas evolves (ca. 1 hr). The reaction mixture is recooled to 0°C, and 22 mL of propargyl bromide solution (0.20 mol) is added dropwise while the temperature is maintained at 0–10°C. Sodium bromide begins to precipitate within 20 min. The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight. After careful addition of 50 mL of water and removal of the stirring bar, the solution is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is taken up in 500 mL of ether and washed with water (3 × 300 mL) and saturated salt solution (1 × 100 mL). The aqueous layers are combined, saturated with salt, and extracted with ether (2 × 150 mL). The ether layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus at 80°C (0.25 mm) to yield 34.0–34.2 g (79–80%) of.
A. (2R,5S)-2-tert-Butyl-1-aza-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-4-one. To a suspension of 40.0 g (0.347 mol) of (S)-proline in 1400 mL of pentane in a 2.5-L, round-bottomed flask are added 225 mL (2.072 mol) of pivalaldehyde and 3.0 mL (38.9 mmol) of trifluoroacetic acid. The mixture is heated at reflux for 72 hr with azeotropic removal of the water formed (Dean-Stark trap). After the addition of another 40.0 mL (0.368 mol) of pivalaldehyde, 1 mL of trifluoroacetic acid (13.0 mmol), and 200 mL of pentane, refluxing is continued for an additional 72 hr. Water, 5.4 mL total, is collected. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, it is filtered under argon. The resulting clear solution is concentrated in a 1000-mL flask under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled in a Kugelrohr oven (70°C/0.0005 mm) and to afford 42.5–47.0 g (0.232–0.257 mol, 67–74%) of the desired product as a colorless oil and.
One hundred and eighty-four grams (151 ml., 4 moles) of formic acid, 1032 g. (1060 ml., 12 moles) of methyl acrylate, 30 g. of hydroquinone, and 2 ml. of sulfuric acid are mixed in a 2-l. two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a capillary inlet tube. The flask is attached to a 100 by 1.7 cm. Vigreux column and is heated in an oil bath at 85–95°. The mixture is heated under total reflux until the temperature of the vapor at the still head falls to 32° (after 1–3 hours). Methyl formate then is distilled slowly at 32–35° as long as it is formed (8–10 hours). A reflux ratio of about 5 to 1 is maintained during the first part of the distillation, which is decreased to total take-off at the end. When no more methyl formate is produced, the excess methyl acrylate is distilled at 32–35°/140 mm. with the bath temperature at 60–65°. During the distillation, a slow stream of carbon dioxide is admitted through the capillary inlet. When all the methyl acrylate has been removed, the acrylic acid is distilled at 53–56°/25 mm. Upon redistillation through the same column acrylic acid of 97% purity (by acidimetric titration) is obtained in a yield of 220–230 g. (74–78% based upon 100% acrylic acid content), b.p. 54–56°/25 mm.
B. 2,5-Dibromo-1,1-dimethyl-3,4-diphenylsilole (2). From this point forward the light sensitivity of some compounds necessitates that certain flasks be wrapped in aluminum foil to exclude light. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two rubber septa, an internal thermometer, and 3-cm egg-shaped stir bar. Under a stream of argon (introduced through a septum with a syringe needle and balloon), lithium wire (0.53 g, 75.6 mmol, 4.5 equiv) is cut into (20-25) small pieces and washed with toluene (2 × 10 mL) to remove the protective oil. One septum is temporarily removed and a funnel is used to aid in the addition of the lithium pieces. The flask is then fitted with a gas adapter and evacuated (1.5 mmHg) for 10 min to ensure that all toluene is removed. The gas adapter is removed and naphthalene (10.12 g, 79.0 mmol, 4.7 equiv) is added with the aid of a funnel. The original septum is replaced and 50 mL of THF is added via syringe. The flask is sonicated for 1 h to facilitate dissolution of the lithium wire, and the resulting dark green solution is left to stir at room temperature for 1 h. The lithium naphthalenide solution thus obtained is titrated according to a literature method3 and found to be 1.35-1.45 M, and the flask is wrapped in foil.
Ethyl (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Ethyl glycidate). A suspension of dry potassium glycidate (26 g of an 90.5:9.5 potassium glycidate:KBr mixture, 0.186 mol), benzyltriethylammonium chloride (42.4 g, 0.186 mol), and ethyl bromide (76 g, 0.7 mol) in methylene chloride, CH2Cl2, (300 mL) is heated at reflux for 16 hr with good stirring. The solvent and excess ethyl bromide are then slowly removed by rotary evaporation without warming, and the resulting viscous solid is triturated with anhydrous diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL) to extract the ethyl glycidate . The combined ethereal extracts are filtered and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is slowly removed by rotary evaporation (without warming) and the residue is distilled at 40°C (2.4 mm) with 0°C water circulated through the condenser to afford 17.6 g of ethyl glycidate (81%),.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a 125-ml. dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a drying tube filled with calcium chloride, are placed 500 ml. of dry benzene and 89.3 g. (0.5 mole) of δ-carbomethoxyvaleryl chloride. The thermometer is adjusted to extend into the stirred liquid but not into the path of the stirrer. The mixture is cooled, with stirring, to 3–5° in an ice bath, then 50.6 g. (0.5 mole) of triethylamine is added as rapidly as is consistent with keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture below 25° (3–5 minutes). When the mildly exothermic reaction has subsided, the ice bath is removed and a warm water bath is used to raise the temperature of the reaction mixture to 33–35° during 10–15 minutes. A heavy white precipitate of triethylamine hydrochloride separates. After the reaction mixture has been warmed to about 35°, the water bath is removed and stirring is continued without heating for 30 minutes.
A 250-mL pear-shaped flask containing a magnetic stir bar and 10.5 g of semicarbazone (50.2 mmol) and 40 mL of diethyl ether is stirred to suspend the solids. To the suspension is added 20 mL of 3 N aqueous hydrochloric acid. No appreciable heat evolution is observed. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 h at ambient temperature (20 °C), at which time all of the solids had disappeared and two clear colorless phases are observed. The biphasic mixture is transferred to a 100-mL separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic layers are then washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 × 5 mL), water (1 × 5 mL), and brine (2 × 5 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (1 g) and then filtered through cotton and concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (150 mmHg, first at 20 °C, then at 40 °C to remove the last traces of solvent) to provide 7.62–7.63 g (50.1–50.2 mmol, >99% yield) of (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone of 98% ee. GC analysis demonstrates the product is formed in >99% product purity.
A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a 2.5-cm magnetic stirring bar is equipped with a Dewar-type reflux condenser containing ice, a dropping funnel, and a gas inlet tube. A calcium chloride drying tube is attached to the condenser and the apparatus is flushed with dry deoxygenated nitrogen. The gas inlet tube is then replaced by a thermometer, and a suspension of 5.0 g of aluminum trichloride in 50 mL of benzene is introduced into the flask. A solution of 100 g (1.85 mol) of 2-butyne and in 50 mL of cold dry benzene is added, with vigorous stirring, through the dropping funnel, over a period of 1 hr. During the addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 30 and 40°C through the use of a water bath. Stirring is continued for 5 hr at 30–40°C after the addition has been completed. The catalyst is then decomposed by pouring the mixture onto 50 g of crushed ice in a 500-mL separatory funnel, whereupon the dark brown color turns pale yellow. When the ice has melted completely, the organic layer is separated, washed with two 25-mL portions of cold water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Benzene and unreacted butyne are removed in a rotary evaporator using a water bath at 40°C and a water aspirator vacuum. The residual liquid is distilled through a short-path distillation head under reduced pressure using a capillary. The yield is 38–50 g (38–50%) of hexamethyl Dewar benzene, bp 43°C/10 mm, mp 7–8°C, nD20 1.4480 and.
In a dry 3-l. flask, fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a 500-cc. dropping funnel, and a condenser provided at its upper end with a drying tube containing a mixture of calcium chloride and soda-lime, is placed 48.6 g. (2 atoms) of magnesium turnings. There are then added 200 cc. of dry ether, a small crystal of iodine, and about 25 cc. of a solution of 253 g. (230 cc., 2 moles) of freshly distilled benzyl chloride in 1 l. of dry ether. If the reaction does not start at once, the flask is partially immersed in a bath containing water heated to about 40°. As soon as the ether begins to boil, and reaction sets in, the bath is removed and stirring is commenced. The remainder of the benzyl chloride in ether can be added during the course of one-half hour if the reaction is regulated by cooling the greater part of the flask by immersion in ice water. The reaction will continue for about fifteen minutes after all the benzyl chloride has been added, and then the mixture is refluxed gently for about fifteen minutes.
The benzene is removed by distillation, 1 l. of methyl alcohol containing 15 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added, and the flask is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser provided with a drying tube. After refluxing gently for five hours the condenser is set downward for distillation and the methyl alcohol is distilled from a steam bath. The residual liquid is cooled and shaken with 500 cc. of cold water. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with one 400-cc. portion and two 200-cc. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are washed twice with 100-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution and finally with two 100-cc. portions of water. After the benzene solution has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, it is transferred to a 2-l. flask and the benzene is distilled, using a steam bath. The residual mixture of methyl benzoate and methyl homoveratrate is transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The first fraction, collected up to 100° at 16 mm., is methyl benzoate (b.p. 87°/16 mm.) and weighs about 75 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount). After a small intermediate fraction of 2–3 g., pure methyl homoveratrate is collected at 176–178°/16 mm. or 129–131°/1 mm. The yield is 76–82 g. (56–60 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the azlactone).
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel, are placed 184 g. (0.5 mole) of benzalacetophenone dibromide and 165 cc. of methyl alcohol. A solution of sodium methoxide, previously prepared from 23 g. (1 atom) of sodium and 230 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol (p. 249), is added rapidly to the stirred solution, and the mixture is then refluxed for one hour.
A. Trichloramine. A mixture of 600 ml. of water, 900 ml. of methylene chloride, and 270 g. (1.32 moles) of calcium hypochlorite is cooled to 0–10° in a 3-l., three-necked, vented flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. A solution of 66.0 g. (1.23 moles) of ammonium chloride in 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 450 ml. of water is added dropwise with stirring over a 1-hour period at 0–10°. After an additional 20 minutes of stirring, the organic layer is separated, washed with three 200-ml. portions of cold water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The yellow solution is filtered, and the trichloramine concentration is determined by iodometric titration.
C. 2-Hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone. The apparatus, as illustrated in Figure 1, is flame-dried while dry nitrogen is passed through. Paraformaldehyde (13 g, 433 mmol) is then added to the 250-mL flask (the generator) and 19.4 g (94.6 mmol) of freshly distilled 2-bromo-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal in 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran containing 2 mg of 2,2'-bipyridyl is added to the 500-mL flask (the reaction flask). The reaction flask is chilled to −78°C with an acetone/dry ice bath and 46.0 mL (105.8 mmol) of butyllithium (2.3 M in hexane) is added dropwise by syringe through the rubber septum during 1 hr. The resultant red solution is stirred for 1 hr and then warmed to −30°C using a methanol–water (2 : 3)/dry ice bath. An oil bath previously heated to 160°C is applied to the generator and the monomeric formaldehyde thus generated is bubbled into the reaction mixture via a steady stream of dry nitrogen until the red color of the indicator is discharged (approximately 45 min). The reaction is quenched by the addition of 10 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and the resultant mixture is poured into 100 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution. This mixture is extracted four times with 100-mL portions of methylene chloride; the methylene chloride extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure affords 8.1–10.7 g of crude 2-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal as a viscous liquid.
The contents of the flask while still hot are poured into a 30-cm. evaporating dish and the alcohol is evaporated on a steam bath. The dry salt is pulverized and thoroughly mixed with 390 g. of calcium oxide, placed in a 2-l. copper retort, and heated with the full flame of a Meker burner. The distillate is placed in a distilling flask and heated on a steam bath; all material distilling under 90° is removed and discarded. The residue is then allowed to stand over solid potassium hydroxide for twelve hours and is finally fractionated. The dimethylpyridine distils at 142–144°/743 mm. The yield is 35–36 g. (63–65 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine, or 30–36 per cent based on the original ethyl acetoacetate).
One kilogram of technical sodium hydroxide and .400 g. of technical potassium hydroxide are melted together in a cast-iron flat-bottomed kettle, 18 cm. in depth and 18 cm. in diameter. The fused mass is well stirred by means of a piece of iron pipe closed at one end, containing a thermometer; the hand is protected by a rubber glove wrapped with a cloth. The temperature of the fused mass is allowed to fall to 230°, and 150 g. (0.73 mole) of technical sodium p-toluenesulfonate is stirred in. The temperature is now slowly raised while 450 g. (2.2 moles) more of sodium p-toluenesulfonate is added slowly, the additions being made whenever the melt becomes sufficiently thin to stir in the solid. When all has been added, the temperature should be about 270°; the addition requires about thirty minutes. The temperature is now raised to 300°, with occasional stirring. At this point there is a layer of heavy froth on the surface of the thin melt, and as the temperature rises this is stirred in, the whole melt becoming frothy and showing a tendency to foam over. On continuing to raise the temperature, the foaming suddenly disappears at about 330°; the melt becomes dark and evolution of hydrogen sets in. The mixture is now thin and of uniform consistency; it is poured at once into an iron tray and allowed to cool.
Two hundred grams of cleaned and dried crab shells ground to a fine powder is placed in a 2-l. beaker, and an excess of dilute (approximately 6 N) commercial hydrochloric acid is added slowly to the powdered material until no further action is evident. Much frothing occurs during the addition of the acid, and care must be exercised to avoid loss of material due to foaming over the sides of the beaker. After the reaction has subsided, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand from 4 to 6 hours to ensure complete removal of calcium carbonate. The residue is then filtered, washed with water until neutral to litmus, and dried in an oven at 50–60°. The weight of dried chitin is usually about 70 g., but with some lots of crab shells it may be as low as 40 g.
A. Pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propan-1-ol . A dry, 5-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer adapter, and a condenser is charged with 417 g (3.06 mol) of pentaerythritol and 730 g (9.24 mol) of pyridine. A Drierite drying tube is attached to the condenser, and the addition funnel is closed with a glass stopper after being charged with 1.134 kg (9.53 mol) of thionyl chloride. The reaction flask is placed inside a bucket to which an ice/water mixture may be added in the event that the reaction becomes too exothermic. Thionyl chloride is added dropwise with vigorous stirring to the slurry so that the white mist that appears in the flask does not rise up into the condenser. Thionyl chloride is added as rapidly as possible over 4-5 hr so that the temperature of the yellow-orange reaction mixture is maintained between 65-95°C. When the addition is complete, the drying tube is removed, and the ice bucket is replaced with a heating mantle. The resulting orange-yellow reaction mixture is heated to 120-130°C until no more sulfur dioxide is evolved. As the heating continues, the reaction mixture turns from dark orange to brown, and gas evolution becomes evident. After gas evolution ceases, the flask is cooled slightly and 2 L of cold water is added with stirring. The brown-yellow product precipitates, is filtered, and washed with 2-3 L of water. The dried, crude product (461 g) is approximately a 1:2.8 mixture of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride (131 g) and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin (330 g, 57% yield). This crude material may be used directly in the next step.
In a 500-ml. flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, are placed 36 ml. of water and 25 g. (0.078 mole) of finely crystalline alloxantin dihydrate (p. 42). The flask and contents are heated on a steam bath to 50°, and 3.6 ml. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.62) is added in a fine stream while vigorous stirring is maintained and the temperature is not allowed to rise above 60°. After all the fuming nitric acid has been added, the temperature is brought to 55° and the stirrer is stopped. In a few minutes a vigorous reaction begins, and large quantities of oxides of nitrogen are evolved. The stirrer is again started, and, if the reaction becomes too violent, the mixture is cooled somewhat; otherwise, the reaction is allowed to take its course. The reaction is complete when a current of air, introduced into the flask above the mixture, does not produce much color due to formation of nitrogen tetroxide. The mixture is then heated to 60–65° for 10–15 minutes, whereupon practically all the solid dissolves. The reaction mixture is poured into a glass (Pyrex) tray and cooled overnight at 0° or below. The large triclinic, colorless crystals of alloxan tetrahydrate are broken up, filtered with suction, washed with ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crystals are then added to 25–26 ml. of hot water, and the mixture is shaken until solution is complete. The solution is filtered immediately, and the filtrate is cooled overnight in a tray at 0°. The crystals are broken up, filtered, washed with ice water, and pressed as dry as possible. These moist crystals of the tetrahydrate, which weigh 22–24 g., are dried to constant weight in a glass tray over concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting product is a fine white powder which weighs 16 g.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an outlet leading to a gas bubbler, is charged with a solution containing 4.0 g. (0.021 mole) of cyclobutadieneiron tricarbonyl2 and 2.0 g. (0.018 mole) of freshly sublimed p-benzoquinone in 72 ml. of acetone and 8 ml. of water. To the vigorously stirred, ice-cold solution, approximately 40–42 g. of ceric ammonium nitrate is added portionwise over a period of 10–12 minutes, until the carbon monoxide evolution has ceased. The reaction mixture is then poured into 600 ml. of cold brine, and the resulting mixture is extracted with five 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts are washed with four 250-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Freshly-cut lithium wire (2.77 g., 0.400 g.-atom) is introduced into the flask and allowed to dissolve for 20 minutes, before a solution of 20.0 g. (0.182 mole) of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one and 3.27 g. (0.182 mole) of water in 400 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and is added dropwise over 60 minutes. Ten minutes after completion of the addition, a solution of 65 g. (0.54 mole) of allyl bromide in 150 ml. of anhydrous ether is added from the dropping funnel in a stream over 60 seconds. Five minutes later 30 g. of ammonium chloride is added as rapidly as possible. Stirring is discontinued, the Dewar condenser is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. A mixture of 300 ml. of ether and 300 ml. of water is added, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and shaken. After separation of the ether layer, the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid and 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, ether is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residual oil is distilled through a 37-cm. column packed with 6-mm. Raschig rings and equipped with a resistance heater for thermal balance. There is a forerun, b.p. 74–80° (12 mm.), consisting principally of 3-methylcyclohexanone, before 12.3–13.6 g. (45–49%) of 2-allyl-3-methylcyclohexanone distils as a 20:1 mixture of trans- and cis-isomers, b.p. 99–102° (12 mm.), nD24 1.4680–1.4683.
A. 4-Carbomethoxy-3-dimethylamino-1-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1-cyclohexene , 2. A dry, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 1-dimethylamino-3-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene (16.6 g, 0.073 mol) and anhydrous ether (30 mL). Methyl acrylate (13.5 mL, 0.15 mol)is added in one portion and the resulting light yellow solution is allowed to stand for 20 hr at room temperature. The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residual methyl acrylate is removed under high vacuum to afford 22.4 g (98%) of the desired cycloadduct 2, in good purity, as a pale-yellow oil.
The wet cake is transferred to a mixture of 100 mL of heptane and 138 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) with stirring. The two layers are separated. The aqueous layer (pH > 12) is extracted with heptane (75 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with water (50 mL), filtered through a cotton wool plug and concentrated under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator, ca. 30 mm). The residue is transferred to a three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer, and the volume is adjusted to 120 mL. The mechanically stirred solution is cooled to −25°C to form a slurry. The slurry is stirred under nitrogen at −25°C for 1 hr and then filtered through a precooled (−18°C, freezer) sintered glass funnel. The solid is rapidly washed with 25 mL of heptane that is precooled (freezer) and then dried by suction to give [R-(R,S)]-β-methyl-α-phenyl-1-pyrrolidineethanol as an off-white crystalline solid (45.9 g, 90% yield, and).
When reduction is complete the cathode liquor is decanted or siphoned from the mercury, filtered from traces of solid matter, and acidified with an excess of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.1). The hydrocinnamic acid separates as an oil and solidifies on thorough cooling. The yield of crude product, which contains water and other impurities, is 180–200 g. It is purified by distillation under reduced pressure. The product boiling at 194–197°/75 mm. (145–147°/18 mm.) is colorless and melts at 47.5–48°. The yield of distilled acid is 160–180 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount) depending upon the quality of the cinnamic acid used.
B. 2-Methoxycyclooctanone oxime. In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride tube, is placed a solution of 53.5 g. (0.252 mole) of crude 2-chlorocyclooctanone oxime hydrochloride in 250 ml. of methanol. While cooling the vessel with running water, 60.7 g. of triethylamine (0.60 mole) is added dropwise during 40 minutes. The reaction temperature is kept below 50° and the reaction is continued for 30 minutes with stirring. After removal of methanol under reduced pressure using an efficient rotatory evaporator, a light brown semisolid is obtained; it is treated with 200 ml. of ether and 200 ml. of water to effect complete solution. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer is further extracted twice with ether. The combined ether solution is washed with saturated sodium chloride and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of ether affords 42.8 g. of crude 2-methoxycyclooctanone oxime as a brown oil.
In the meantime, a mixture of 79 g. (0.55 mole) of cuprous bromide and 80 ml. (0.6 mole) of 48% hydrobromic acid is heated to boiling in a 5-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask, equipped with a condenser set for distillation and provided with a 2-l. receiving flask, a steam inlet tube closed by a screw clamp, and a separatory funnel. About one-fourth of the diazonium solution is transferred to the separatory funnel, without filtration, and immediately run into the cuprous bromide-hydrobromic acid solution, which is kept boiling over a free flame, at such a rate that boiling is continuous. When the separatory funnel is nearly empty a further portion of the cold diazonium solution is transferred to it without interrupting the addition. All the diazonium solution is added in this way over a period of about 30 minutes, during which time much of the product steam-distils. When the addition is complete, the stopcock in the separatory funnel is closed, the screw clamp in the steam line is opened, and a vigorous current of steam is passed through the mixture until no more organic material distils. About 1–1.5 l. of distillate is collected.
A. Boc-L-leucine N-methyl-O-methylcarboxamide. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an electronic digital thermometer, and a graduated addition funnel. The flask is charged with 39.1 g (0.4 mol) of N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and 236 mL of methylene chloride. The suspension is stirred and cooled to 2°C with an ice–water bath. N-Methylpiperidine., 48.8 mL (0.41 mol), is placed in the addition funnel and added dropwise while the temperature is maintained at 2° ± 2°C. A clear colorless solution results which is kept cold and used in the following reaction.
C. [18]Annulene. In a 300-ml., conical flask fitted with a side arm (with a closed stopcock) and a 3.5-cm. Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar is placed 1 g. of a 10% palladium-on-calcium carbonate catalyst and 30 ml. of benzene. The flask is attached to an atmospheric pressure hydrogenation apparatus, and the air in the system is replaced by hydrogen by evacuating the flask and refilling with hydrogen three times. The catalyst suspension is stirred until no more gas is absorbed. One-third (390 mg., determined spectroscopically) of the "pure" tridehydro[18]annulene solution described in Part B is evaporated to dryness, and the resulting brown crystalline residue is dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene. This solution is added to the hydrogenation flask through the side arm without stirring. The mixture is now stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere as rapidly as possible (ca. 600 r.p.m.) until 207 ml. (4.9 molar equivalents) of gas (22°, 740 mm.) are absorbed over ca. 5 minutes. The mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel, and the catalyst is washed with three 20-ml. portions of benzene.
A 2-l., three-necked flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube extending almost to the bottom of the flask, and an efficient reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. After the apparatus has been dried in an oven, 800 ml. of dichloromethane and 157 g. (142 ml., 2.00 moles) of acetyl chloride are added to the flask. This solution is stirred while 320 g. (2.40 moles) of powdered, anhydrous aluminum chloride is added in portions over a 15-minute period. As soon as this addition is complete, a stream of propene gas is passed through the continuously stirred reaction solution at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux. The gas flow is continued until no more heat is evolved and refluxing ceases (10–30 hours,, at which time the flask is nearly full and the contents separate into two layers after stirring is stopped. The contents of the flask are poured cautiously onto about 1.5 kg. of ice, and the upper organic layer is separated. The aqueous phase is shaken with three 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane, and the combined organic solutions are washed with 50 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
The dithiane is filtered and dried over phosphorus pentoxide or sodium hydroxide in a desiccator at atmospheric pressure. It melts at 112–113° and weighs 16.5–18.1 g. (55–60%).
For purification the material is dissolved in 300 cc. of hot benzene; the solution is boiled three minutes with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon, and filtered hot, with gentle suction, through a warm Büchner funnel. The benzene filtrate is treated with 500 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol, heated to boiling, and then cooled to 10° in an ice bath, with shaking. After the crystals are filtered with suction and pressed thoroughly, 50 cc. of ethyl alcohol is allowed to soak into the cake and suction is applied again. The recrystallized product weighs 52–57 g. (23–25 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 152.5–153.5°. This product is the trans-trans form of the diene.
A mixture of 66.5 g (0.5 mole) of tetrahydroquinoline and 400 g. of trimethylene chlorobromide is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser, and heated in an oil bath held at 150–160° for 20 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled, a solution of 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 500 ml. of water is added, and the excess trimethylene chlorobromide is removed by distillation with steam. The acid residue from the steam distillation is made alkaline with a 40% solution of sodium hydroxide (about 75 ml.), and the julolidine is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal solution is washed with 150 ml. of water and dried over sodium hydroxide pellets. The ether is evaporated and the residue distilled under reduced pressure. The portion that boils at 105–110°/1 mm. is collected and. The yield is 67–70 g. (77–81%).
The combined filtrates, on cooling, deposit the hydrochloride of the aminonaphthoic acid; this is filtered with suction and is pressed as dry as possible. To obtain a second crop of the hydrochloride, the filtrate is heated to 85°, 500 g. of salt is added, and the solution is cooled.
In a 3-l. flask, fitted with a stirrer and a fractionating column with condenser for downward distillation, are placed 912 g. (815 cc., 2.75 moles) of ethyl propane-1,1,2,3-tetracarboxylate (p. 272) and 950 cc. of a solution of equal volumes of pure concentrated hydrochloric acid and distilled water. A receiver with a side tube is attached to the condenser; this side tube leads to a water trap. The mixture is boiled, with continual stirring, at such a rate that the alcohol is removed as fast as it is formed, but without undue removal of water from the flask. The progress of the reaction can be followed by noting the rate at which carbon dioxide passes through the trap. When the temperature at the head of the column approaches 100°, the flame is turned down so that very little liquid distils over. Heating is continued until evolution of carbon dioxide ceases.
This product contains small amounts of chloride and ammonia. For purification it is dissolved in 200 to 215 cc. of water with warming. This solution is shaken with 10 g. of permutit and filtered. The glycine is then precipitated by the addition of approximately five volumes (about 1250 cc.) of methyl alcohol. The glycine is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with methyl alcohol and ether, and dried in the air. The yield is 96–98 g. (64–65 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which darkens at 237° and melts at 240° with decomposition. It gives no test for chlorides and is free from ammonium salts as indicated by the test with Nessler's reagent.
To 68 g. (0.5 mole) of phenylacetic acid in a 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a system for absorbing hydrogen chloride, is added 35 g. (0.25 mole) of phosphorus trichloride. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for one hour. While the contents of the flask are still warm, 400 cc. of dry benzene is added. The benzene solution of phenylacetyl chloride is decanted from the residue of phosphorous acid onto 75 g. (0.56 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride in a dry, 1-l. flask which can be fitted to the same condenser. The reaction is vigorous at first and cooling is necessary. The mixture is refluxed for one hour on a steam bath, then cooled and poured into a mixture of 500 g. of cracked ice and 200 g. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with a mixture of 100 cc. of benzene and 100 cc. of ether. The ether-benzene solution is washed once with 100 cc. of water, and then dried over 40–50 g. of calcium chloride. The solution is filtered with suction into a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure; the residue consists of a brown oil which solidifies on cooling.
A. Active barium. An oven-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed, 300-mL flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, is flushed with argon. Freshly cut lithium (210 mg, 30.3 mmol) and biphenyl (4.7 g, 30.5 mmol) are placed in the apparatus and covered with dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (80 mL), and the mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. In a separate, oven-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed, 500-mL flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL addition funnel, is placed anhydrous barium iodide (BaI2) (6.0 g, 15.3 mmol) ((Note 4),) under an argon atmosphere; this is covered with dry THF (80 mL), and stirred for 5 min at room temperature. To the resulting yellowish solution of BaI2 in THF is added at room temperature a solution of the lithium biphenylide through a stainless steel cannula under an argon stream. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, and the resulting dark brown suspension of active barium thus prepared is ready for further use.
A. Methylthio-2-propanone.2 A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a two-necked adapter holding a thermometer and a condenser topped with a silica gel drying tube. After 700 ml. of anhydrous methanol has been added, the third neck is stoppered, and the flask is immersed in an ice water bath. Stirring is begun, and 108 g. (2.00 moles) of sodium methoxide is added in small portions at a rate sufficiently gradual to prevent a large exotherm. When all of the methoxide has dissolved and the temperature has returned to 5°, the stopper is replaced with a 200-ml., pressure-equalizing, jacketed addition funnel. This funnel, charged previously with 130 ml. (2.20 moles) of methanethiol, contains a 2-propanol-dry ice slurry in the cooling jacket, and is topped with a silica gel drying tube. Stirring and cooling are continued while the methanethiol is run into the flask over a 20-minute period, and for 15 minutes thereafter. The jacketed addition funnel is then replaced by a standard, 200-ml., pressure-equalizing addition funnel, which is used to add 185 g. (2.00 moles) of chloroacetone to the reaction mixture over 1 hour. When this addition is complete, the ice bath is removed, and the suspension is stirred overnight at room temperature. The insoluble material, largely inorganic salts, is removed by filtration through Celite, and the filter cake is washed with two 150-ml. portions of absolute methanol. After methanol has been removed from the combined filtrates by distillation, the residue is distilled through a 300-mm. Vigreux column, yielding 155–158 g. (74–76%) of methylthio-2-propanone, b.p. 153–154°, nD23 1.4728.
A. (+)-B-allyldiisopinocampheylborane ((+)-(Ipc)2B(allyl) or (lIpc)2B(allyl)) ( 1). A 500-mL, 3-necked oven-dried round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3-cm oval Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is fitted with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. The flask is charged with (+)-B-methoxydiisopinocampheylborane ((+)-(Ipc)2BOMe) (13.3 g, 42.1 mmol, 1.25 equiv) and diethyl ether (45 mL), which results in a clear and colorless solution. The solution is cooled to 3 °C in an ice/water bath and vigorously stirred. Allylmagnesium bromide solution (1.0 M in diethyl ether, 40 mL, 40 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is then added dropwise over 20 min via a 60 mL disposable syringe with 18-gauge needle, maintaining the temperature below 6 °C. A large amount of white solids (presumably MgBr(OMe)) precipitate during the addition. After the addition is complete, the ice/water bath is removed, then the reaction mixture is vigorously stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting (lIpc)2B(allyl) mixture in ether is used immediately in the next step without further purification.
While the Grignard solution is being refluxed, the dropping funnel is charged with bis(tributyltin) oxide (371 g, 0.62 mol) in 150 mL of anhydrous ether. After the reflux, heating is stopped and the bis(tributyltin) oxide solution is added at such a rate as to maintain a reaction temperature of 36–38°C. The addition requires approximately 1 hr. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hr and then stirred overnight at room temperature.
A. 2,5-Dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione. A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding small pieces of sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) as rapidly as possible to 900 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol contained in a 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two stoppers and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube packed with calcium chloride and soda lime. The reaction is completed by heating the mixture under reflux for 3–4 hours. To the hot solution is added diethyl succinate (348.4 g., 2 moles) in one portion (Caution! Exothermic reaction), and the mixture is heated under reflux by maintaining the original bath temperature for 24 hours. A thick pink-colored precipitate is formed almost immediately and remains throughout the reaction.
A 2-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser provided with a calcium chloride drying tube, is charged with 100 g. (0.625 mole) of diethyl malonate and 400 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol. Stirring is started, and a solution of 35 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets in 400 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol is added at room temperature during a period of 1 hour. A white crystalline precipitate forms during the addition, and, after all the hydroxide has been added, stirring is continued for an additional 2 hours. After the mixture has stood overnight, it is heated to boiling on the steam bath and filtered while hot with suction. Precipitation of the potassium ethyl malonate is completed by cooling the filtrate in an ice bath. The salt is collected by suction filtration, washed with a small amount of ether, and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. An additional amount of the potassium salt is obtained by concentrating the mother liquors on the steam bath to about 100–125 ml. The total yield is 80–87 g. (75–82%).
B. N1,N2-Bis(methoxycarbonyl)sulfur diimide. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a gas outlet stopcock, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and containing a magnetic stirring bar, is purged with dry nitrogen and charged with 53.0 g (0.37 mol) of methyl N,N-dichlorocarbamate and 0.2 mL of pyridine. The dropping funnel is filled with 20.6 g (0.2 mol) of freshly distilled sulfur dichloride. The whole apparatus is closed and connected by way of the gas outlet to a paraffin-oil-filled valve. About 2 mL of sulfur dichloride is then added dropwise into the stirred flask. When the evolution of chlorine has started (usually after about 5 min), the remainder of the sulfur dichloride is added at such a rate that three to five bubbles of chlorine per second are evolved, without allowing the temperature of the reaction mixture to exceed 35°C for more than short intervals. The addition takes 1.5–2 hr. After the addition is completed and the evolution of gas has slowed down significantly, volatile materials are removed by stirring the mixture at 60°C under reduced pressure (11–15 mm) for about 10 min. Further removal is accomplished at room temperature at 0.01–0.05 mm for approximately 1 hr. The product (33.0–35.0 g), a moisture-sensitive, viscous, yellow oil, is used directly without further purification.
B. 4-(2-Bromo-2-propenyl)-4-methyl-γ-butyrolactone. A flame-dried, 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, nitrogen inlet adapter, and a 100-mL dropping funnel. The flask is purged with nitrogen and charged with (2-bromoallyl)diisopropoxyborane (16.2 g, 0.065 mol), prepared above, in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, and ethyl levulinate (9.96 g, 0.069 mol) in 30 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over 1 hr from the dropping funnel. After the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr and then at room temperature overnight, it is poured into 50 mL of water and extracted three times with 50-mL portions of ether . The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with 50 mL of dry dichloromethane , and 1 mL of trifluoroacetic acid is added. After the mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight, it is poured into water (50 mL) and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-mL portions of ether . The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate and 50 mL of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a 15-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure to give 9.22 g (65%) of 4-(2-bromo-2-propenyl)-4-methyl-γ-butyrolactone , bp 88-90°C (0.6 mm),, plus 1.9 g of recovered ethyl levulinate, bp 48°C (0.6 mm), and a mixed fraction (0.8 g) containing ethyl levulinate and the product.
A. 5,6,11,12-Tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (1). A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, an internal thermometer and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (capped with a rubber septum), is flame-dried and purged with argon. Degassed THF (200 mL) is added and subsequently granular lithium (6.63 g, 956 mmol, 2.5 equiv). The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of freshly sublimed α,α'-dibromo-o-xylene (101 g, 382 mmol) in degassed THF (150 mL). This solution is then added dropwise to the stirred suspension of granular lithium over a period of 1.5 h, which begins to reflux after 20 min. During the period of addition the internal temperature of the mixture is kept between 65 °C and 70 °C. After complete addition, the mixture is refluxed for 2 h (oil bath) until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the substrate.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed 1045 cc. of concentrated commercial hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.138). The flask is surrounded with a freezing mixture of ice and salt, and, when the contents are at 0°, stirring is started and 500 g. of cracked ice is added, or more ice can be added and the external cooling dispensed with; then 372 g. (364 cc., 4 moles) of aniline, also cooled to 0°, is run in during five minutes. The mixture is treated with 500 g. more of cracked ice, and a cold solution (0°) of 290 g. (4 moles) of technical sodium nitrite dissolved in 600 cc. of water is allowed to run in slowly (twenty to thirty minutes) from a separatory funnel, the end of which is drawn to a small tip and reaches nearly to the bottom of the flask. During this addition, the stirrer is operated rather vigorously, and the temperature is kept as near 0° as possible by the frequent addition of cracked ice (about 1 kg.).
The solution is cooled until its temperature is approximately that of the room, and 500 ml. of a mixture of equal parts of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water is added with stirring. The flask is then arranged for steam distillation and heated with a free flame while steam is passed into the reaction mixture until about 200 ml. of distillate is collected. While hot, the mixture is placed in a large separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer removed; the nitrobenzene layer is filtered through a Büchner funnel and.
The mother liquor is again concentrated under reduced pressure until crystals begin to form on the surface of the solution (1400–1500 cc.). It is then cooled to room temperature, and a first crop of methylamine hydrochloride, containing some ammonium chloride, is obtained by filtering the cold solution and centrifuging the crystals. At this point 625–660 g. of crude product is obtained. The mother liquor is now concentrated under reduced pressure to about 1000 cc. and cooled; a second crop of methylamine hydrochloride (170–190 g.) is then filtered off and centrifuged. This crop of crystals is washed with 250 cc. of cold chloroform, filtered, and centrifuged, in order to remove most of the dimethylamine hydrochloride which is present; after the washing with chloroform the product weighs 140–150 g. The original mother liquor is then evaporated under reduced pressure, as far as possible, by heating on a steam bath, and the thick sirupy solution (about 350 cc.) which remains is poured into a beaker and allowed to cool, with occasional stirring, in order to prevent the formation of a solid cake. The thick paste so obtained is centrifuged, and the crystals (170–190 g.) are washed with 250 cc. of cold chloroform; the solution is filtered and the crystals are centrifuged, thus yielding 55–65 g. of product. There is no advantage in further concentrating the mother liquor.
B2. 1-Acetoxy-4-benzylamino-2-butene. Method 2. In a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask are placed in order 8.91 g (0.06 mol) of the chloroacetate from Method A, 100 mL of acetonitrile, and 19.3 g (0.18 mol) of benzylamine. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser and the solution is refluxed for 2 hr using an oil bath at 100–110°C. The reaction mixture is cooled and 150 mL of ether and 100 mL of a saturated sodium carbonate solution are added. The mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel and the organic phase is collected. The aqueous phase is extracted with 50 mL of ether. The combined organic phases are dried over potassium carbonate. The solvent and excess benzylamine are removed by rotary evaporation and Kugelrohr distillation at 50°C (1 mm). Kugelrohr distillation of the crude product gives 9.1–9.9 g (70–76%) of 1-acetoxy-4-benzylamino-2-butene as a 90 : 10 mixture of the E and Z isomers.
The benzene solution is dried with 20 g. of calcium chloride and the benzene removed by distillation under diminished pressure on a water bath. The residue is poured into a mortar where it solidifies. The crystalline mass is then ground with small amounts of ether (200 cc. in all), filtered, and washed with ether (about 100 cc.) until pure white. The yield of ethyl phthalimidomalonate melting at 73–74° is 155–162 g. From the ether filtrate after distilling the ether, there may be recovered a further amount by washing with a small amount of ether to remove the brown color. The total weight of ester obtained in the two crops is 180–190 g. (67–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to room temperature. The excess aluminum chloride is decomposed by treating the reaction mixture with 350 g. of crushed ice followed by 25 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solid obtained is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water. The crude product weighs about 35 g. (89–90%). Recrystallization from 4 l. of water yields 25–30 g. (64–77%) of green, silky needles melting at 202–203°.
A. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride. A dry, 100-ml., round-bottomed flask is charged with 36.3 g. (0.242 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and 27.3 g. (0.192 mole) of phosphorus pentoxide. The flask is stoppered and allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 3 hours. During this period the reaction mixture changes from a slurry to a solid mass. The flask is fitted with a short-path distilling head and heated first with a stream of hot air from a heat gun and then with the flame from a small burner. The flask is heated until no more trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride distills, b.p. 82–115°, yielding 28.4–31.2 g. (83–91%) of the anhydride, a colorless liquid. Although this product is sufficiently pure for use in the next step, the remaining acid may be removed from the anhydride by the following procedure. A slurry of 3.2 g. of phosphorus pentoxide in 31.2 g. of the crude anhydride is stirred at room temperature in a stoppered flask for 18 hours. After the reaction flask has been fitted with a short-path distilling head, it is heated with an oil bath, yielding 0.7 g. of forerun, b.p. 74–81°, followed by 27.9 g. of the pure trifluoromethanesulfonic acid anhydride, b.p. 81–84°.
A. 6-Chloro-2-hexyne. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a low-temperature condenser, a gas-inlet, and a magnetic stirrer. Sodium hydroxide drying tubes are placed to precede the inlet and on the condenser. The system is purged with nitrogen, and approximately 650 ml. of anhydrous ammonia is condensed. Freshly cut sodium metal (20.2 g., 0.878 g.-atom) is added to the refluxing ammonia. After dissolution of the sodium (about 20 minutes is required), 0.2 g. of iron(III) nitrate is added. Two hours of stirring are allowed for conversion of the deep-blue solution of sodium in ammonia to sodium amide. The reaction mixture is cooled to −73° using an acetone-dry ice bath and 35.3 g. (50.0 ml., 0.882 mole) of precondensed propyne,, is added in portions over a 1-minute period through a glass funnel precooled in dry ice. The mixture is stirred, with continued cooling for 15 minutes, and 153.5 g. (0.975 mole) of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is added from an addition funnel over 20 minutes. After 30 minutes of additional stirring, 250 ml. of diethyl ether is added to the flask, the dry ice bath is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. Water (200 ml.) is added to the reaction vessel, and the resulting solution is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel. The water layer is removed and extracted once with 100 ml. of ether. The combined ether extracts are treated with 6 M hydrochloric acid until the aqueous layer is acidic (approximately 20 ml. is required). The ether layer is separated and dried in three stages over magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent and distillation of the crude product through a 20-cm. Widmer column yields 49.4–56.0 g. of 6-chloro-2-hexyne, b.p. 58–64° (20 mm.), which contained some 1-bromo-3-chloropropane (to be removed in the next step). The corrected yield is 29–31%.
B. 2-(1-Hydroxycyclopropyl)-2-methyl-1-tetralone. Simultaneously with the above operations, a separate 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet, and a septum, and the flask is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. Anhydrous ether, 600 mL, and 20 mL of a 3.0 M solution of methylmagnesium bromide in ether (60 mmol,) are added to the flask with a cannula and a syringe, respectively, and the solution is cooled to 0°C. A solution of 6.12 g of cyclopropanone ethyl hemiketal2 (60.0 mmol,) in 20 mL of anhydrous ether is added with vigorous stirring over several minutes with a cannula. During this addition, gas evolution is observed, and a fine white precipitate forms. After the mixture is stirred for 15 min, the solution of the enolate of 2-methyl-1-tetralone is added using a wide gauge cannula (ca. 1 mm id) over several minutes. The resulting turbid, light yellow solution is heated at reflux for 4 hr. The resulting clear, yellow solution is cooled to 25°C and diluted with 200 mL of ether. The organic solution is washed with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (3 × 200 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (200 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to give 7.92 g of crude 2-(1-hydroxycyclopropyl)-2-methyl-1-tetralone as a clear yellow oil that is used in the next step without further purification.
A mixture of 1 l. of benzene, 600 g. (529 cc., 6.1 moles) of 2-furylcarbinol (p. 276), 225 g. (2.7 moles) of fused powdered sodium acetate, and 650 g. (602 cc., 6.4 moles) of a good grade of acetic anhydride are placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser provided with a calcium chloride tube. The flask is heated on a steam bath for four hours with stirring to prevent caking of the sodium acetate.
B. 1-Amino-1-methylcyclohexane. A 3-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a paddle stirrer, a condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel with an extension for below-surface addition. Provision is made for introduction of nitrogen by use of a side-arm adapter. The vessel is charged with 196 g. (2.0 moles) of methylcyclohexane and 106 g. (0.80 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. A solution (ca. 600 ml.) of trichloramine (0.40 mole) in methylene chloride is added with efficient stirring over a period of 2 hours at −5° to 5°. Throughout the reaction a stream of nitrogen is passed through the flask. The brown mixture is stirred for an additional 20–30 minutes at the same temperature.
B. Disodium 7,16-diketodocosanedioate. A mixture of 120 g. (3.00 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 1.4 l. of commercial absolute ethanol is refluxed with mechanical stirring in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask until all the sodium hydroxide is dissolved (about 2 hours). The solution is cooled to room temperature, and a warm solution of the crude 2,2'-sebacoyldicyclohexanone from Step A in 300 ml. of absolute ethanol is added. The mixture is brought to a boil on a water bath or steam bath in the course of about 15 minutes and is then refluxed for 1 hour. Colorless disodium 7,16-diketodocosanedioate separates during the heating. The reaction mixture, now a thick mush, is cooled to room temperature, and the salt is collected on a 25-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible, preferably with the aid of a rubber dam. The moist salt is suspended in 1 l. of absolute ethanol with mechanical stirring and is then collected on the Büchner funnel as before. After being dried in air, the crude colorless disodium 7,16-diketodocosanedioate weighs 248–255 g. (112–115%, based on 1-morpholino-1-cyclohexene). It is pure enough for the following reduction to docosanedioic acid.
The crude dihydroresorcinol is dissolved in 125–150 ml. of hot benzene, filtered to remove the sodium chloride, and allowed to crystallize. The solid is separated by filtration and dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator. The product melts at 103–104° and weighs 48–53 g. (85–95%).
Sparteine is recovered by making the aqueous phases basic with aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (160 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with Et2O (4 × 150 mL), and the combined organic phases are dried over potassium carbonate (K2CO3), filtered, and the solvents removed under reduced pressure to afford 30.3 g (98%) of crude, recovered sparteine as a pale yellow oil. Fractional distillation of the residual oil from calcium hydride (CaH2) affords 27.0 g of sparteine (88%) suitable for reuse.
A. (−)-Methyl 2-pyrrolidone-5(R)-carboxylate. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, loose fitting rubber septum, and a needle for nitrogen inlet which is vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 6.60 g (51.1 mmol) of (R)-(+)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid and 200 mL of methanol. Thionyl chloride (0.50 mL, 6.8 mmol) is added cautiously by syringe over a 0.5-min period to the rapidly stirring solution at room temperature. The reaction flask is sealed with the septum and the nitrogen inlet removed after addition is complete, and the resulting solution is stirred continuously at room temperature for 24 hr. The flask is uncapped, and aqueous, saturated sodium carbonate is added with stirring until the reaction solution is pH 7 to litmus paper. After removal of the methanol at room temperature under reduced pressure by rotary evaporator, the residue is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 10 mL of aqueous, saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to afford 5.60 g (75% yield) of colorless methyl (R)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylate, bp 83°C (0.25 mm), [α]24D −8.6° (EtOH, c 1.13).
A. N-(Methoxycarbonyl)-2-propenylamine (2). A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, an argon gas inlet tube, a rubber septum, which is pierced with a Teflon-coated thermocouple, and a 200-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum is charged via syringe through the septum with allylamine (1) (14.0 mL, 10.68 g, 187 mmol, 2.1 equiv) and 100 mL of dichloromethane. The solution is cooled to 0 °C (internal temperature) in an ice-water bath and a solution of methyl chloroformate (7.0 mL, 8.6 g, 91 mmol) in 30 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 10 min. The resulting white mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min and then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and extracted with 50 mL of aqueous 1M HCl solution, 50 mL of saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, and 50 mL of saturated aqueous NaCl solution. The organic phase is dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (23 °C, 16 mmHg) to afford 10.12–10.26 g (97–98%) of carbamate 2 as a colorless oil.
B. Shake flask. A 2800-mL Fernbach flask fitted with a vapor bulb and an air inlet (see Figure 1) containing 500 mL of MSB solution with 0.2% L-arginine·HCl is sterilized. After cooling, the 50-mL preculture is added via aseptic transfer. The vapor bulb is filled with 10 mL of chlorobenzene , and the flask is carefully placed in an orbital incubator shaker at 150 rpm and 30°C for 48 hr. The excess chlorobenzene is removed from the central chamber with a pipette, and the pH of the solution is adjusted, if necessary, to approximately 8 or 9. The suspension is poured into two large centrifuge tubes, and the cells are removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 10°C and 8000 rpm. The supernatant solution is saturated with salt and extracted with ethyl acetate (4 × 100 mL). The organic layers are combined, dried with magnesium or sodium sulfate , and filtered. The solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure to afford a tan-colored solid (190 mg). The diene diol is further purified by recrystallization from methylene chloride/hexanes to yield an off-white solid (160 mg). The material has a reasonable shelf life when kept acid-free to inhibit decomposition to chlorophenols.
A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, rubber septum with a nitrogen source, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalized dropping funnel is charged with 150 mL (140 g, 1.63 mol) of vinyl acetate and. Stirring is initiated and the flask content is cooled in an ice–water bath to 3°C. Chlorosulfonyl isocyanate (25 mL, 40 g, 0.28 mol) and is added as rapidly as possible from the addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at less than 5°C. The cooling bath is removed and the temperature is allowed to rise to 10°C. At this point an exothermic reaction begins. Intermittent cooling is required as the temperature is kept at 10–15°C for 40 min. The dark-red mixture is then cooled to −40°C in a dry ice–acetone bath.
To the cell are added diethyl fumarate (172 g, 1.0 mol), absolute ethanol (200 mL), and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (3.41 g, 0.1 mol). The mixture is allowed to stand for 0.5 hr to allow complete dissolution of the tetrabutylammonium perchlorate. The cell is placed in a flowing-water bath in a hood.
B. Cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde. A 50-mL distilling flask equipped with a receiver cooled to −20°C with a dry ice–methanol bath is charged with 34 g (0.39 mol) of a crude mixture of both cis- and trans-1,2-cyclobutanediol and 10 μL of boron trifluoride butyl etherate. The mixture is heated to 230°C with a metal bath. Drops of liquid appear on the condenser, and the aldehyde and water distill into the receiver. The temperature of the distillate oscillates between 50 and 100°C. Each time the distillation stops, 5–10 μL of boron trifluoride butyl etherate is added to the distilling flask. The distillate is transferred into a separatory funnel and sodium chloride is added. The organic layer is decanted and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with 25-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic solution is dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 15-cm, helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The residue consists of practically pure cyclopropanecarboxaldehyde, 17.5–21.6 g (65–80%).
1. Aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide was prepared by dissolving 500 g of sodium hydroxide pellets in water and diluting to 1 L.
The resulting brown solution is poured into a separatory funnel and shaken with 225 ml. of 30–60° petroleum ether. After brief standing, the mixture when viewed against a strong light can be seen to have separated into a reddish upper hydrocarbon layer and a smaller, very dark lower layer containing chromium compounds and acetic acid. The lower layer is drawn off and discarded. Then 50 ml. of water is added to the hydrocarbon layer, and the mixture is shaken and allowed to settle. Another lighter-colored, lower layer is drawn off and discarded, and the process is repeated with 50 ml. more water. The hydrocarbon layer, now light in color, is then shaken with 110 ml. of Claisen's alkali; this first portion neutralizes the residual acetic acid and acidic oxidation products and extracts some of the enedione as the yellow enolate. The funnel is allowed to stand, with occasional twirling, until the lower layer has settled to a clear yellow solution; the upper hydrocarbon layer acquires a dirty red-brown color. The extract is drawn off into a wide-mouthed 2-l. separatory funnel charged with 200 ml. of water, 600 g. of ice, 200 ml. of 36% hydrochloric acid, and 300 ml. of ether. The hydrocarbon layer is extracted in the same way with five more 100-ml. portions of Claisen's alkali and then discarded.
B. Pseudoephedrine L-allylglycinamide . A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum through which is placed a needle connected to a source of vacuum and argon. The system is evacuated, the flask is flame-dried and then allowed to cool to 23°C under reduced pressure. When the reaction flask has cooled to 23°C, it is flushed with argon and charged with 200 mL of dry THF and 63.0 mL (0.450 mol, 1.025 equiv) of diisopropylamine. The resulting solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. With efficient stirring, the solution is deoxygenated at 0°C by alternately evacuating the reaction vessel and flushing with argon three times. After the solution is deoxygenated, 167 mL (0.439 mol, 1 equiv) of a 2.63 M solution of butyllithium in hexanes and is added via syringe over a 20-min period. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at 0°C for 15 min.
C. 3-Butyl-2-fluoro-1-tosylindole. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a glass stopper, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar, and a reflux condenser connected to the argon line. The system is flame-dried and flushed with argon. The flask is charged with anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide (50 mL) and crude o'-(1,1-difluorohex-1-en-2-yl)-p-toluenesulfonanilide (8.77 g). Sodium hydride (0.65 g, 27 mmol) is added in portions to the solution at 0 °C. After the reaction mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 30 min, the flask is placed in an 80 °C oil bath. The mixture is stirred at this temperature for 7 h, at which time TLC analysis indicates the reaction to be complete. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, and phosphate buffer (100 mL) is added. Organic materials are extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 150 mL), and the combined extracts are washed with water (4 × 100 mL) and brine (100 mL), and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g). After filtration through a filter paper and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the resulting brown residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel. The eluent containing the product is concentrated under reduced pressure to provide pure 3-butyl-2-fluoro-1-tosylindole as a yellow liquid (6.43 g, 80% over two steps).
A. 2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid monohydrate. Crushed, fused zinc chloride (20 g.) is shaken with 250 ml. of acetic anhydride in a 1-l. three-necked flask until most of the solid dissolves. The flask is then equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer reaching into the liquid, and a dropping funnel. As the flask is cooled in an ice bath, 50 g. (0.28 mole) of D-glucono-δ-lactone is added slowly with vigorous stirring. During the addition, the temperature should be kept below 65°. After an hour in the ice bath, the solution is kept at room temperature for 24 hours and is then poured into 1 l. of water and stirred until the hydrolysis of the acetic anhydride is complete (about an hour). The mixture is placed in a refrigerator until the product crystallizes completely. The crude material is removed by filtration and washed with a small amount of ice water. The 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid monohydrate thus obtained melts at 113–117°. The yield is 79–84 g. (74–79%).
Aluminum foil (30 g. or 1.1 g.-atoms, thickness 0.002–0.003 cm.) is cut into strips 5 × 25 cm., and each strip is rolled into a cylinder about 1 cm. in diameter. Each of the aluminum foil cylinders is amalgamated by immersing it in a solution of 8.0 g. (0.030 mole) of mercury(II) chloride in 400 ml. of water for 15 seconds. Each amalgamated cylinder is then rinsed successively in ethanol and ether, and added to a mixture of 1.5 l. of ether and 15 ml. of water contained in a 3-l., three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and two efficient reflux condensers in series. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously, and 60 g. (0.58 mole) of 2-methyl-2-nitropropane is added dropwise at a rate such that the ether refluxes briskly. The reaction usually exhibits a 5- to 7-minute induction period, after which a vigorous reaction occurs and cooling with an ice bath is necessary. After addition of the nitro compound is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes. The stirrer is then stopped and the gelatinous precipitate is allowed to settle. The colorless reaction solution is decanted through a glass wool plug into a 2-l. separatory funnel and washed with two 250-ml. portions of 2 M aqueous sodium hydroxide. The precipitate in the reaction flask is washed with two 500-ml. portions of ether, and these washings are combined and washed with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The combined ethereal solutions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual crystalline solid is dried under reduced pressure (10–15 mm.) at room temperature, leaving 33.7–38.7 g. (65–75%) of the crude hydroxylamine product, m.p. 59–60°, which is sufficiently pure for use in the next step. The crude product may be recrystallized from pentane, yielding the pure N-tert-butylhydroxylamine as white plates, m.p. 64–65°.
B trans-4,4'-Dibromostilbene . A 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with the above triazene (14.3 g, 53 mmol) and methanol (125 mL). The stirred solution is cooled to 0°C and 40% tetrafluoroboric acid (HBF4, 23 mL, 106 mmol) is added dropwise over 10 min. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the reaction brought to room temperature. It is stirred for an additional 10 min and palladium acetate [Pd(OAc)2, 0.12 g, 0.53 mmol] is added followed by the dropwise addition of a solution of vinyltriethoxysilane (4.94 g, 5.5 mL, 26 mmol) in methanol(10 mL). A second lot of Pd(OAc)2 (0.12 g, 0.53 mmol) is added and stirring continued for a further 30 min at room temperature. The mixture is warmed to 40°C for 20 min and finally heated under reflux for 15 min. The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to half its volume and water (150 mL) is added. The precipitated solid is filtered, washed with water and dried in air. It is then boiled with toluene (125 mL) and filtered while hot. The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 70 mL, warmed to 70°C and light petroleum (30 mL) is added. Upon cooling to room temperature, the product crystallizes (4.20 g). Concentration of the mother liquor gives an additional crop (0.70 g) of the product (combined yield 4.90 g, 46.5%, Note 9).
A solution of 40 g. (0.2 mole) of sec-butyl 3-methylheptanoate in 100 ml. of ethanol containing 18.5 g. (0.3 mole) of potassium hydroxide and 20 ml. of water is heated under reflux for 30 minutes and. The cooled solution is diluted with 200 ml. of water and acidified by the addition of 60 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The organic acid is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of 1:1 benzene-ether, and the combined benzene-ether extracts are washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution. The resulting solution is filtered by gravity through a bed of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of solvents by distillation, 26–27 g. (90–94%) of 3-methylheptanoic acid, b.p. 116–117°/10 mm., n25D 1.4242, is obtained by distillation in a modified Claisen flask.
Slowly and with stirring, 100 g. (0.65 mole, 59 cc.) of cold (1–4°) α-bromopropionic acid is added to 3 l. (44.5 moles, 2700 g.) of cold (1–4°) concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) in a 1-gal. glass-stoppered bottle, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for at least four days. The solution is concentrated to a volume of 300 cc., filtered, and concentrated further to 200 cc. The solution is cooled to room temperature and 1 l. of methyl alcohol added. After chilling overnight in a refrigerator (0–4°) the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with 250 cc. each of methyl alcohol and ether. The yield is 42–48 g. of crude alanine.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with stirrer, dropping funnel, and efficient reflux condenser are placed 450 g. (5 moles) of urethan (m.p. 46–48°), 7.5 l. of dry ether, and 218 g. of sodium wire and. The mixture is warmed, and evolution of hydrogen accompanied by formation of sodium compound soon begins; after 2–3 hours the greater part of the metal will have been replaced by a gelatinous white precipitate. The stirrer is now started and the mixture warmed under reflux for an additional 2 hours. The flask is then cooled externally with running water, and 1050 g. (9.6 moles) of ethyl chlorocarbonate is added slowly over a period of 2 hours. The gelatinous precipitate becomes powdery, and the remainder of the sodium dissolves. After all the ester has been added, the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature and then filtered. The white residue is washed with 1 l. of ether, and the ether is removed from the combined solutions by evaporation on a steam bath. The residual oil is distilled; after a fore-run containing some urethan, the product distils at 143–147° /12 mm. The yield is 575–640 g. (51–57%). On redistillation, all the product boils at 146–147° /12 mm.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 1-l. separatory funnel, is placed 2100 g. (16.6 moles) of 50 per cent nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.32) (Hood). The acid is heated nearly to boiling, and 1 g. of ammonium vanadate is added. The stirrer is started, and 500 g. (5 moles) of cyclohexanol is introduced slowly through the separatory funnel. At first 40–50 drops of cyclohexanol are admitted and the reaction mixture is stirred until the reaction has started (four to five minutes) as is indicated by the evolution of oxides of nitrogen. Then the reaction flask is placed in an ice-water bath and cooled until the temperature of the oxidizing mixture is 55–60°. The cyclohexanol is then added as rapidly as possible while the temperature of the mixture is kept within these limits. Toward the end of the oxidation (after about 475 g. of cyclohexanol has been added) the ice bath must be removed and sometimes heat must be applied in order to maintain the temperature and avoid crystallization of adipic acid.
(B) Reduction of Nitrourea.—After the apparatus is assembled, 600 cc. of 20 per cent sulfuric acid is placed in the battery jar, and the lead anode in the porous cup is also covered with acid of the same strength. The cell is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, the stirrer is started, and, while the solution is cooling, 50 g. (0.48 mole) of nitrourea is added to the catholyte. A thermometer is placed in the catholyte, and when the temperature drops to +5° the current is turned on as follows: with the rheostat set for maximum resistance, the current is switched on, then the rheostat is gradually adjusted until the current flowing through the cell is about 0.06 ampere per square centimeter of cathode surface. The cell must be efficiently cooled with ice and salt so as to keep the temperature at all times below 10°. The reduction requires five to six hours. The nitrourea is quite insoluble but gradually dissolves as it is reduced. The foam and clumps of solid are worked down into the liquid occasionally. When almost all the nitrourea is in solution, some of the catholyte should be drawn up with a pipette and used to wash down the nitrourea that adheres to the walls of the vessel. The reduction is continued for about ten to twenty minutes after the nitrourea has dissolved. When the reduction is complete, as is indicated by a marked evolution of hydrogen, the current is shut off, and the porous cup is washed down with a little distilled water and removed.
Concurrently with the tetrazotization, 104 g. (1.68 moles) of boric acid is dissolved in 222 g. (6.66 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid. The solution is made in a 1-l. beaker, which has been coated inside with paraffin, and is cooled in an ice bath. The boric acid is added slowly in small portions, and the mixture is stirred with a lead rod. It is necessary to keep the temperature below 20–25° in order that the heat of solution may not melt the paraffin from the walls of the beaker.
C. (S)-2-(1H-Tetrazol-5-yl)-pyrrolidin-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (4). An oven-dried, single-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas inlet adaptor and a stirring bar is evacuated and backfilled with argon. The glass Ar adaptor is quickly removed and the flask is charged with (S)-2-cyano-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (3) (15.28 g, 66.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv), sodium azide (5.61 g, 86.3 mmol, 1.3 equiv), triethylamine hydrochloride (11.9 g, 86.3 mmol, 1.3 equiv) and toluene (65 mL) under an argon atmosphere, which results in a white mixture upon stirring. A reflux condenser with an Ar adaptor is fitted to the flask and the reaction mixture is heated to 95 °C (external temperature) in an oil bath for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. After complete consumption of starting material (as monitored by thin layer chromatography, Note 32), deionized water (100 mL) is added and the mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The flask is rinsed with additional toluene (25 mL) and deionized water (25 mL) and the aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is further washed with water (50 mL) and the combined aqueous extracts are transferred to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and are cooled with stirring in an ice/water bath to 0 °C (external temperature). Sodium nitrite solution (20 wt % aqueous, 21 mL, 61 mmol, Note 33) is added in one portion, followed by dropwise addition of sulfuric acid (20 wt % aqueous, 20 mL, 72 mmol, Note 34) with vigorous stirring until gas evolution ceases, the solution is acidic and a sticky orange solid is formed. The aqueous mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, the flask is rinsed with ethyl acetate (50 mL) and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried (MgSO4, 18 g), filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (24-45 °C, 30 mmHg) to afford crude product 4 as a sticky, orange foam. This material is then used directly in the next step.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a stirrer are placed 24 g. (1.05 gram atoms) of oxide-free sodium and 200 ml. of xylene. The condenser is protected by a drying tube containing soda-lime. The flask is surrounded by an oil bath which is heated until the sodium is melted. The stirrer is started, and, after the sodium is powdered, the oil bath is removed. When the contents of the flask have cooled to room temperature, the stirrer is stopped, the xylene decanted, and the sodium washed with 100 ml. of dry ether to remove traces of xylene.
A 1000-mL, multinecked flask is provided with an efficient stirrer, vented outlet, thermometer, and 250-mL dropping funnel. The flask is surrounded by an ice–water bath and charged with 62.5 mL (68.4 g, 0.53 mol) of quinoline, 250 mL of dichloromethane, 55 g (0.55 mol) of finely powdered calcium carbonate, and 250 mL of water. The mixture is stirred vigorously, cooled to 10°C, and maintained at 10–15°C as a solution of 37.5 mL (56.5 g, 0.49 mol) of thiophosgene in 120 mL of dichloromethane is added over 15 min. There is very little exotherm or foaming. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at ambient temperature overnight. The reaction is then filtered through a bed of filter aid. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are washed twice with 150 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid, then with 150 mL of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Concentration under reduced pressure gives 95–103 g of crude material. This is dissolved with heating in 400 mL of cyclohexane, decolorizing carbon is added, and the mixture is filtered through a bed of filter aid. The filtrate is heated under reflux for 2 hr and allowed to cool with stirring. The resulting solid is isolated by filtration, washed with cyclohexane, and dried in a vacuum oven at 40°C to give 78–83 g (84–89%) of o-isothiocyanato-(E)-cinnamaldehyde as cream crystals, mp 77–79°C.
The mixture is then poured into a mortar where it solidifies to a solid mass. When cold, the mixture is ground up with water to remove most of the potassium bromide and filtered. The precipitate is then reground with water and refiltered, finally being washed well with water. The solid material on the filter consists of some potassium bromide, some phthalimide, and the ethyl phthalimidomalonate. Without drying, it is put into a 1-l. flask with 400 cc. of benzene and heated to boiling. After cooling, the insoluble bromide and phthalimide are removed by filtration. The filtrate contains some water, which is removed by means of a separatory funnel.
The flask is arranged for distillation, and the reaction mixture is distilled under slightly diminished pressure on a water bath until the residue is practically dry. To the residue 100 cc. of water is added, and the process of distillation to dryness is repeated. The distillates are combined and saturated with potassium carbonate (about 300 g. is required); the upper layer of dimethylnitrosoamine is removed, and the water layer is extracted with three 140-cc. portions of ether. The combined nitrosoamine and ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and distilled through a 30-cm. fractionating column. The yield of product boiling at 149–150° /755 mm. is 195–200 g. (88–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). Nitrosodimethylamine is a yellow oil which darkens in bright light.
The oil is dried over a little calcium chloride and distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of phenyl isothiocyanate boiling at 120–121°/35 mm. is 60–63 g. (74–78 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and 500-cc. separatory funnel, is placed 13.4 g. (0.55 atom) of magnesium shavings. The shavings are then covered with 50 cc. of anhydrous ether. A crystal or two of iodine and 3 g. of sec.-butyl chloride are added. The reaction is started by warming the flask with a microburner and is then allowed to proceed by its own heat for twenty minutes. A second addition of 50 cc. of anhydrous ether is made. A solution of 43 g. (the remainder of 0.5 mole) of sec.-butyl chloride in 300 cc. anhydrous ether is added over a period of twenty minutes. Vigorous refluxing is avoided by externally cooling the flask with water. The heat from the reaction causes refluxing to continue for twenty minutes after the addition of the halide solution. The reaction mixture is then gently refluxed for one hour with a microburner. The reaction flask is surrounded by an ice and salt mixture and the solution cooled to − 12° in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The nitrogen gas, obtained directly from a cylinder, is dried by passing through two wash bottles containing concentrated sulfuric acid and a phosphorus pentoxide tower. It is admitted to the flask through an entry tube 10 mm. in diameter at a height of about 60 mm. above the surface of the ether solution. An additional 100 cc. of ether is added, and the separatory funnel is replaced by a thermometer.
B. 2,5-Dimethylmandelic acid. A mixture prepared from 140 g. (0.5 mole) of 2,5-dimethylphenylhydroxymalonic ester and a cold solution of 140 g. of potassium hydroxide in 560 ml. of water in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is warmed on a steam bath for 5 hours. The alkaline solution is cooled and extracted with one 100-ml. portion of ether to remove any material not soluble in alkali. The alkaline solution is acidified with 300 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and then warmed on a steam bath and stirred for 2 hours (or until there is no further evidence that carbon dioxide is escaping). The mixture is cooled, the oily layer is extracted with ether, the ethereal solution is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is distilled under partial vacuum. The oily residue is crystallized from benzene. The yield of 2,5-dimethylmandelic acid melting at 116.5–117° is 55–63 g. (63–70%).
C. (4R,5R)-2,2-Dimethyl-α,α,α',α'-tetra(naphth-2-yl)-1,3-dioxolane-4,5-dimethanol . To the Grignard solution obtained in Part B is added, with stirring and cooling by an ice bath, a solution of (R,R)-dimethyl O,O-isopropylidenetartrate (48.1 g, 0.22 mol) (see Part A) in tetrahydrofuran (480 mL). During the addition the internal temperature should not exceed 20°C and. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 1.5 hr using an oil bath, then cooled to room temperature.
The residual product is cooled to about 100° and poured into 250 ml. of water. The crystallized solid is crushed and collected on a 12-cm. Büchner funnel. Slight suction is applied at first, but, after most of the mother liquor has been removed, the crystals are pressed down with strong suction. The product is then washed thoroughly with water. After drying, the yield of colorless 2-benzylaminopyridine and, m.p. 95–96°, amounts to 180–183 g. (98–99% of the theoretical amount). The product may be recrystallized from isopropyl alcohol with 90% recovery. For each gram of amine 3 ml. of solvent is employed. The melting point of recrystallized material is 96.0–96.7° (cor.), lit.2 m.p. 97–98°.
Method A. Enantiomerically pure ethyl (R)-2-fluorohexanoate (60% hydrolysis). A 1-L Morton flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a glass baffle, an electrode connected to a pH control unit, and an addition tube connected to a syringe pump is charged with 300 mL of 0.05 M aqueous phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) (Fisher), 300 mL of deionized water, and 70 g (0.43 mol) of ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate. The resulting mixture is stirred for several minutes and the pH is adjusted to 7.0 with the addition of a few drops of 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution. Then 0.43 g of Pseudomonas lipase enzyme (P-30, Amano International Enzyme Co., Inc., Troy, VA) is added and the hydrolysis is allowed to proceed at 5°C with stirring (reaction time ca. 2 hr). The pH is kept constant at 7.0 by adding 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution via the syringe pump, which is activated by the pH control unit. The hydrolysis is discontinued when 260 mL of 1.0 N sodium hydroxide solution has been added (60% conversion,). The mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (5 × 300 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated at 40°C / 70 mm. Vacuum distillation at 36–38°C / 0.7–0.8 mm gives 24.0 g (34% yield, 85% of theory,) of pure ethyl (R)-2-fluorohexanoate, which is 97.5–99% enantiomerically pure, [α]D25 + 13.0 to + 13.2° (CHCl3, c 1.3). The aqueous layer is acidified to pH 2 with 3 N hydrochloric acid and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at 40°C / 70 mm. The residue is distilled at 71–72°C / 0.7 mm to give 30.9 g (53% yield: 89% of theory) of (S)-2-fluorohexanoic acid, which is 53–68% enantiomerically pure [α]D25 −6.8 to −8.7° (CHCl3, c 1.3).
To 300 g. of polyphosphoric acid precooled to 5° is added 28 g. (0.1 mole) of ethyl α-acetyl-β-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-propionate2 contained in a 400-ml. beaker. The mixture is stirred thoroughly with a strong spatula for 15 minutes. The temperature, which is around 10° at the beginning, increases rapidly and is kept between 20° and 25° by occasionally cooling the beaker in an ice-water bath. The deep-yellow reaction paste is then poured immediately into 600 ml. of ice water with thorough stirring and trituration, and the beaker is rinsed with small portions of cold water. The product, which separates from the cold water as a colorless precipitate, is extracted with several portions of chloroform (first with 400 ml., then twice with 200 ml., and finally with 100 ml. of this solvent). The combined chloroform extracts are washed successively with 100 ml. of cold water, then once with 100 ml., twice with 50 ml. of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally with 50 ml. of cold water. The chloroform solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The chloroform is removed by distillation on a steam bath first at atmospheric pressure and finally under reduced pressure. The residual pale-yellow oil soon solidifies and is practically pure. The yield of ethyl 6,7-dimethoxy-3-methylindene-2-carboxylate is 21.5–22.5 g. (82–86%), m.p. 81–83°.
B. 2-Benzylcyclopentanone. A mixture of 30 g. (0.177 mole) of lithium iodide dihydrate and and 140 ml. of dry 2,4,6-collidine in a 300-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen-inlet system (as in step A) is heated to reflux. As soon as all the lithium iodide has dissolved, 30 g. (0.129 mole) of 2-benzyl-2-carbomethoxycyclopentanone dissolved in 30 ml. of 2,4,6-collidine is added to the boiling, faintly yellow solution; and during this process the solution turns darker in color and a precipitate forms. Evolution of carbon dioxide begins immediately, and its formation can be followed by passing the nitrogen flush through a saturated barium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated under reflux and a nitrogen atmosphere for 19 hours, at the end of which time the evolution of carbon dioxide is very slow.
A. 1-(2-Iodophenyl)pyrrole. A 50-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed, flame-dried flask equipped with a Teflon-coated stirbar, a glass stopper, an addition funnel and a reflux condenser is charged with 2-iodoaniline (12.5 g, 57.1 mmol) and glacial acetic acid (12.5 mL, Note 1). The resulting solution is heated to reflux before 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran (7.8 mL, 59.0 mmol, Note 1) is added over a period of 10 min via the dropping funnel and reflux is continued for 5 min once the addition is complete. The addition funnel and reflux condenser are replaced by an inlet for a thermocouple and a distillation head with condenser, respectively, and the acetic acid is slowly removed by distillation under reduced pressure (15 mmHg, bath temperature about 50 °C) over a period of approximately 4 h. During this time, the internal temperature slowly reaches 50 °C. The remaining brown residue is transferred to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and is purified by short-path distillation in vacuum (0.04 mmHg, Note 3). The fraction distilling at 90–102 °C is collected to give 1-(2-iodophenyl)pyrrole as a brown liquid (9.78–10.12 g, 64–66%).
The crude solids are treated with 189 mL of hexanes (4 mL/g) and slurried at room temperature for 10 min before heating to reflux. The resulting hazy solution is treated with 47.3 mL of methanol (1 mL/g), which clarifies the mixture. Crystallization is induced by removing the heat source and allowing the mixture to cool slowly to room temperature over 2 hr. The flask is placed in a freezer to chill overnight. The thick slurry of crystals is filtered, rinsed with cold hexanes, 2 × 40 mL , and vacuum dried at room temperature to afford 42.5 g of pale yellow crystals (86.3% overall yield) and.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, thermometer, condenser, and dropping funnel, is placed 684 g. (845 cc., 9.2 moles) of dry n-butyl alcohol. The condenser is connected to a trap for absorbing hydrogen chloride, and 500 g. (305 cc., 4.2 moles) of thionyl chloride is added over a period of two hours, with stirring. The reaction mixture is kept at 35–45°, by immersing the flask in ice water, during the addition of the first half of the thionyl chloride. After evolution of hydrogen chloride begins, the water bath is removed and a small flame applied to maintain this temperature. After all the thionyl chloride has been added the temperature is raised gradually to the boiling point, over a period of thirty minutes, to complete the reaction and remove the remainder of the hydrogen chloride. The reaction mixture is then transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and fractionated under diminished pressure. After a fore-run consisting largely of unchanged alcohol, there is obtained 625–689 g. (77–84 per cent of the calculated amount) of n-butyl sulfite, b.p. 109–115°/15 mm. Refractionation gives 585–674 g. (72–83 per cent) of a product distilling at 109–112° at 14 mm..
A. Cyclobutanol. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 600 mL of water, 57.5 mL (ca. 0.68 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 57.7 g (0.80 mol) of cyclopropylcarbinol. The reaction mixture is stirred and refluxed for 3 hr. Cyclobutanol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the flask is then immersed in an ice bath. To the cold, stirred mixture is added 24 g (0.6 mol) of sodium hydroxide pellets, followed by 6.7 g (0.08 mol) of sodium bicarbonate to complete the neutralization. The mixture is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted for 30 hr with diethyl ether using a liquid–liquid continuous extraction apparatus. The ethereal extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the drying agent is removed by filtration. The bulk of the solvent is distilled from the filtrate to give 55.0 g of residual liquid containing 88% cyclobutanol and 12% 3-buten-1-ol by gas chromatography. The crude product is carefully distilled through spinning band columns to give 32.8 g (57%) of cyclobutanol, bp 122–124°C. Gas chromatographic analysis of the product shows it to be 95% pure,(Note 3),(Note 4).
The dark green benzanthrone is filtered on a large Büchner funnel, washed well with water, and boiled for thirty to forty minutes with 1.2 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The product is filtered, washed free of the dark-colored liquor, and dried at 120°; weight, 67–71 g.; benzanthrone content, about 87 per cent. The crude material is boiled with 500 cc. of technical tetrachloroethane in which all but about 8 g. of a black char easily dissolves. The solution is boiled under reflux for fifteen minutes with 25 g. of decolorizing carbon, and then filtered while hot through a Büchner funnel directly into a 2-l. round-bottomed, long-necked flask, the residue being washed with hot tetrachloroethane (100–150 cc.) until the filtrate is colorless. After the addition of 400–500 cc. of hot water the solvent is removed by steam distillation, a process which requires but little time. The benzanthrone left as a residue is filtered and dried at 120°. The yield of yellow solid, which melts at 168–170° and is pure enough for many purposes, is 56–60 g. (70–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 5-Benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazole (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer (fitted with a 7.5-cm glass paddle), a condenser (open to the atmosphere) and a rubber septum is charged with 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (5.00 g, 35.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) and MeOH (200 mL). Methylhydrazine (1.9 mL, 1.66 g, 35.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is added to this solution dropwise via syringe over 3 min. After 2 h at room temperature, the formation of hydrazone 1 is complete. The septum is removed and 3,4-methylenedioxy-β-nitrostyrene (5.50 g, 28.5 mmol) is added as a solid in one portion. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature open to air for 72 h. The condenser is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel and water (60 mL) is added to the mixture over 20 min. The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 h. The yellow solid that is formed is collected on a 250-mL fritted glass Büchner funnel by vacuum filtration (washing with ca. 30 mL of 1:1 MeOH/H2O) and is suction-dried overnight. The yellow solid is dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling MeOH, then after being cooled to room temperature, the product is collected by suction filtration in 125-mL fritted glass Büchner funnel as a fine brown powder (6.07 g, 19.3 mmol, 68%).
B. 1-(1-Adamantyl)cyclohexanol. Activated calcium prepared from preformed lithium biphenylide and excess CaBr2 in THF is cooled to −78°C. 1-Bromoadamantane (543 mg, 2.52 mmol) in THF (10 mL) is added via a cannula at −78°C and the mixture is stirred at −78°C for 20 min. Excess cyclohexanone (520 mg, 5.30 mmol) is added via a disposable syringe at −78°C. The resulting mixture is gradually warmed to −20°C and stirred at −20°C for 30 min. The reaction mixture is then quenched with water at −20°C (20 mL) and warmed to room temperature. At this temperature it is filtered through a small pad of Celite which is washed with diethyl ether (Et2O, 100 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (15 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). Removal of the solvent and flash-column chromatography on silica gel (150 g, 230–400 mesh, eluted sequentially with hexane/EtOAc [0% to 15%]) affords reasonably pure 1-(1-adamantyl)cyclohexanol as a white solid. 1-(1-Adamantyl)cyclohexanol is recrystallized from hexanes as follows: The white crystals are dissolved in a limited amount of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), hexane (15 mL) is added, the solvent is evaporated to 8 mL, more hexane (15 mL) is added, the solvent is evaporated to about 15 mL, and the solution is gradually cooled and allowed to stand for 24 hr to afford 469–476 mg (80–82% yield) of product as colorless needles, mp 169–171°C,(Note 9).
To an oven-dried, 200-mL, conical flask with air replaced by argon, containing 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and sealed with a rubber septum, 13.9 g (19.3 mL, 137.4 mmol) of diisopropylamine is added with a syringe. The flask is placed in an ice–water bath. After 15 min, 84 mL (134.4 mmol) of 1.6 M butyllithium in hexane is slowly added with a syringe and with gentle swirling of the flask. The solution is kept for 5 min at this temperature.
The nearly solid paste of the sodium derivative is allowed to cool to room temperature and then stirred thoroughly with 800 cc. of dry ether. The solid is collected by suction and washed repeatedly with dry ether. The phenyloxaloacetic ester is liberated from the sodium salt with dilute sulfuric acid (29 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 500 cc. of water). The almost colorless oil is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-cc. portions of ether, which are combined with the oil. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the ether is distilled. The residual oil, contained in a modified Claisen flask having a fractionating side arm, is heated under a pressure of about 15 mm. in a bath of Wood's metal. The temperature of the bath is brought gradually to 175° and kept there until the evolution of carbon monoxide is complete. During this process the heating is momentarily discontinued in the event of a temporary increase in pressure. At the end of the reaction (five to six hours) the oil which has distilled is returned to the flask, and the ethyl phenylmalonate is distilled at reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 158–162°/10 mm. weighs 189–201 g. (80–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
An intimate mixture of 600 g. (4.4 moles) of finely powdered, freshly fused potassium acid sulfate and 400 g. (2.7 moles) of powdered tartaric acid, prepared by grinding them together in a mortar, is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask connected with a condenser which is filled with water but does not have any water flowing through it. The mixture is heated by means of an oil bath maintained at a temperature between 210 and 220° until liquid no longer distils over. Some foaming takes place, but, if fused potassium acid sulfate is used and the temperature of the bath does not rise above 220°, it is not difficult to control. The distillate is then fractionated under reduced pressure. Pyruvic acid passes over at 75–80°/25 mm. and the yield is 117–128 g. (50–55 per cent of the theoretical amount).
5-Iodoanthranilic acid is best purified by recrystallization of its ammonium salt, as follows: To 100 g. of the acid in a 400-cc. beaker is added 200 cc. of hot water, and the acid is dissolved by stirring in concentrated ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) until solution is complete at 60° and there is a slight excess of ammonia. About 40 cc. of concentrated ammonia is required. Sodium hydrosulfite is added in about 1-g. portions until no further bleaching action is observed, about 5 g. of decolorizing charcoal is added, and, after stirring three minutes, the mixture is filtered with suction on a preheated Büchner funnel into a preheated flask. The filter is washed with 10 cc. of boiling water.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a stopper is charged with 160 g (50.9 mL, 1.0 mol) of bromine and 150 mL of water. The mixture is stirred rapidly while cooling in an ice–salt bath to −5°C, and a solution of 49.0 g (1.0 mol) of sodium cyanide in 150 mL of water is added dropwise over a 40–50 min period while maintaining the temperature of the reaction mixture at −5 to 5°C. The resulting solution is stirred an additional 5–10 min. A solution of 89.5 g (0.95 mol) of phenol in 300 mL of tetrachloromethane is added in one portion to the flask. The resulting mixture is stirred vigorously while 96.0 g (131 mL, 0.95 mol) of triethylamine is added dropwise over a 30–40-min period at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 5–10°C. After an additional 15 min of stirring, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 50-mL portions of tetrachloromethane. The organic phases are combined and washed three times with 50-mL portions of water and then dried over polyphosphoric anhydride (P2O5). The drying agent is removed by filtration and the solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at 20°C (25 mm). A few drops of polyphosphate ester are added to the remaining liquid and the product is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column to give 85–96 g (75–85%) of phenyl cyanate, bp 77–79° (13 mm), nD20 1.5094–1.5100, d420 1.096. The product is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor.
A. β-Cyanoethylhydrazine. To a 2-l. two-necked flask fitted with a thermometer and a pressure-equalizing funnel are added a large magnetic stirring bar and 417 g. (6.00 moles of N2H4·H2O) of 72% aqueous hydrazine hydrate. Acrylonitrile (318 g., 6.00 moles) is gradually added with stirring during 2 hours. The internal temperature is kept at 30–35° by occasional cooling of the flask. The funnel is replaced by a distillation condenser. Removal of water by distillation at 40 mm. at a bath temperature of 45–50° gives 490–511 g. (96–100%) of β-cyanoethylhydrazine as a yellow oil that is suitable for use in the next step. This product can be purified by distillation; b.p. 76–79° (0.5 mm.).
A. [(+)-2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl]-(η4-1,5-cyclooctadiene) rhodium(I) perchlorate. [Rh{(+)-BINAP} (1,5-C8H12)] ClO4. A dry, 250-mL Schlenk flask, filled with dry nitrogen or argon and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 0.53 g (1.08 mmol) of chloro-(1,5-cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) dimer. Then 40 mL of dry acetone is added using an airtight syringe. The flask is protected from light by wrapping it with aluminum foil and 0.45 g (2.17 mmol) of silver perchlorate is added to the stirred suspension. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The colorless precipitate of silver chloride is removed by suction filtration under argon through a stainless-steel cannula fitted with a filter tip. The precipitates are washed with 5 mL of acetone. To the pale-orange filtrate and the washings is added 1.34 g (2.16 mmol) of (+)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl [(+)-BINAP] and the resulting dark-red solution is stirred under argon for 18 hr at ambient temperature. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (60 mm) to ca. 3 mL. Then 30 mL of ether is slowly added with a syringe. The resulting mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 18 hr. The orange solid is filtered off under argon and washed with 5 mL of ether. The crude product is dissolved in 50 mL of dry acetone and the solution is concentrated to ca. 3 mL under 60 mm pressure. Dry ether (30 mL) is slowly added and the mixture is stirred for 18 hr. The deep-orange crystals are collected by filtration, washed with 5 mL of dry ether, and dried under vacuum to afford 2.07 g of recrystallized product, 230–235°C (dec).
A solution of 20 g. of 2,4-diaminotoluene sulfate in 200 cc. of water at 60° is cooled to 40°, and made alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. To this solution is added 15 g. of the sulfate, which is dissolved by raising the temperature of the mixture to 55°. The solution is cooled to 40° and made slightly alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is then cooled to 30° and filtered by suction. The remainder of the diaminotoluene sulfate (14 g.) is then dissolved in the filtrate by heating the mixture to 55°. The solution is cooled to 40° and again made alkaline to litmus with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is cooled to 25°, and the diaminotoluene crystals are collected on a Büchner funnel. The entire product is dried to constant weight in a desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield is 26.5 g. (95 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the diaminotoluene sulfate used) of a product melting at 97–98.5°.
B. 3-Butylcyclobutenone. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two glass stoppers, and a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The flask is charged with 52.6 g (0.805 mol) of zinc dust, 121 mL of tetramethylethylenediamine, and 270 mL of absolute ethanol, and cooled with an ice bath while 46 mL of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise over 5 min. The reaction mixture is maintained at 0°C while a solution of 26.59 g (0.138 mol) of 3-butyl-4,4-dichlorocyclobutenone in 27 mL of absolute ethanol is added over 10 min via the dropping funnel. After 15 min the ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2.5 hr and then filtered through a sintered-glass Büchner funnel with the aid of 1.5 L of a 1 : 1 mixture of diethyl ether and pentane. The filtrate is washed successively with 500 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid, 500 mL of water, 800 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 500 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow oil is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a short-path distillation head and a pear-shaped receiver flask that is cooled below −75°C with a dry ice–acetone bath. Distillation at 0.001 mm (bath temperature 50–70°C) provides 3-butylcyclobutenone (13.4–16.2 g, 78–86% yield) as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 33°C (0.001 mm).
B. 1,2-Di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane. To a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel protected from moisture by a drying tube, and a magnetic stirring bar, are added 43.2 g (0.21 mol) of phosphorus pentachloride and 50 mL of hexane, and the flask is cooled with an ice–salt bath. While the solution is stirred, a solution of 30 g (0.13 mol) of 2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane in 100 mL of hexane is added dropwise. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 90–180 min until no starting material is observed in the NMR spectrum of a sample; the reaction mixture is then filtered through a sintered-glass filter to remove excess phosphorus pentachloride. The resulting hexane solution (~ 200 mL), which contains 1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane, 2-chloroethyl dichlorophosphate, 1,2-dichloroethane, phosphorus oxychloride, and traces of phosphorus pentachloride, is transferred into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a dry-ice condenser protected from moisture by a potassium hydroxide tube, and a short inlet tube connected to an ammonia cylinder. The reaction flask is cooled with a dry ice–acetone bath and, while the solution is stirred, a fast stream of gaseous ammonia is introduced. A vigorous reaction takes place and a copious white precipitate forms. The stream of gaseous ammonia is continued for 15–60 min. The cooling bath and condenser are removed, the reaction flask is connected to an ordinary aspirator line through a potassium hydroxide drying trap, and the ammonia is evaporated under aspirator vacuum with efficient stirring. The ammonia-free solution is filtered through a sintered-glass filter and the precipitate is washed with hexane. The resulting hexane solution (400–500 mL), which contains 25–26 g (0.12 mol) of pure 1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1,2-dichloroethane, is suitable for the next operation (yields, calculated from an aliquot, are 95–97%).
E. (2S,3S)-(+)-(3-Phenylcyclopropyl)methanol . A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer and an internal thermocouple probe, is charged with 45 mL of dichloromethane and 1.60 mL (14.9 mmol) of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME). The solution is cooled to −10°C (internal temperature) with an acetone/ice bath, and 1.50 mL (14.9 mmol) of diethylzinc is added. To this stirred solution is added 2.40 mL (29.8 mmol) of diiodomethane over a 15-20 min period while maintaining the internal temperature between −8°C and −12°C. After the addition is complete, the resulting clear solution is stirred for 10 min at −10°C. A solution of 2.41 g (8.94 mmol) of the dioxaborolane ligand in 10 mL of dichloromethane is added via cannula under argon over a 5-6 min period while maintaining the internal temperature below −5°C. A solution of 1.00 g (7.45 mmol) of cinnamyl alcohol in 10 mL of dichloromethane is immediately added via cannula under argon over a 5-6 min period while maintaining the internal temperature under −5°C. The cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 8 hr at that temperature.
The crude benzoyl cyanide is purified by fractional distillation through a column. The low-boiling material is taken off at a reflux ratio of 25–30 to 1 until the temperature reaches 208°; about 15 g. is collected. The benzoyl cyanide is collected at a reflux ratio of 1 to 1 at a temperature of 208–209°/745 mm. (bath temperature 260–280°). The distillate solidifies to colorless crystals which melt at 32–33°; the product weighs 80–86 g. (60–65%).
The mixture is cooled to room temperature, transferred to a 4-l. separatory funnel, and washed with three 300-ml. portions of saturated brine, to remove copper salts, and three 300-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, to remove benzoic acid. The benzene solution is then washed with 150 ml. of brine and is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
B. 1-Benzylisoquinoline. An 11.4-g. portion of 55% sodium hydride–mineral oil dispersion is washed free of oil by slurrying with two 40-ml. portions of dry hexane and decanting the liquid. The sodium hydride is transferred to a dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a nitrogen-inlet tube. A slurry formed by adding 200 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide is cooled to −10° with a methanol-ice bath. Stirring is begun, and a solution of 65.0 g. (0.250 mole) of 2-benzoyl-1,2-dihydroisoquinaldonitrile and 32 g. (29 ml., 0.25 mole) of benzyl chloride in 400 ml. of dry N,N-dimethylformamide is added dropwise over 1 hour. During addition the reaction mixture becomes dark, then fades to light brown. Ice is added as required to hold the bath temperature near −10°.
C. trans-Cyclooctene. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet capillary tube, a short (10–20 cm.) unpacked column, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The round-bottomed flask is connected by the unpacked column to a 100-ml. trap cooled in an ice bath. This trap is then connected to a 200-ml. trap cooled in dry ice-acetone. The flask is heated in an oil bath to 110–125°, and the apparatus is evacuated to a pressure of ca. 10 mm. under a constant sweep of nitrogen. The hydroxide solution is added dropwise at approximately the rate of decomposition of the quaternary ammonium hydroxide.
The reaction mixture is filtered through a medium porosity sintered glass funnel (600 mL capacity) pre-coated with a pad of 20 g of Celite moistened with methyl acetate. The flask and filtered solids are washed with methyl acetate, about 1 L total, and then the combined filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 °C, 5 mmHg). The resulting orange residue is dislodged with a spatula, and then dissolved in 200 mL of hot methanol. The methanolic solution is placed in a 5 °C explosion proof refrigerator and a precipitate forms over 24 h. The solid is collected by filtration and washed with 100 mL of diethyl ether, then dried (23 °C, 1 mm) to afford 46.3 g (33%) of product as a white solid (mp 179–180 °C).
(A) Diazotization of Sulfanilic Acid.—A mixture of 105 g. (0.5 mole) of sulfanilic acid dihydrate, 26.5 g. (0.25 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 500 cc. of water is heated and stirred until all the sulfanilic acid has dissolved, and the solution is then cooled in an ice bath to 15° (sodium sulfanilate begins to crystallize at this temperature). A solution of 37 g. (0.54 mole) of sodium nitrite in 100 cc. of water is added and the resulting solution is poured at once onto a mixture of 106 cc. (1.25 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) and 600 g. of ice contained in a 2-l. beaker. The solution, from which p-benzenediazonium sulfonate separates on stirring, is allowed to stand in an ice bath for fifteen to twenty-five minutes, during which time the naphthoxide solution is prepared.
(C) Creatinine Picrate.—A mixture of 300 g. (2 moles) of commercial creatine hydrate with 190 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 50 cc. of water is warmed in a glass or porcelain dish on a steam bath for twenty-four hours. The resulting mass of creatinine hydrochloride crystals is dissolved in 1 l. of water, boiled with a little decolorizing carbon, and filtered. The solution is then diluted to 4 l. with distilled water, and heated to boiling in a 12-l. flask under a reflux condenser. To the hot solution is added, with good stirring, a solution of 500 g. (2 moles) of technical picric acid (containing 10 per cent of water) in 1250 cc. of warm methyl alcohol. Stirring is continued for one hour on the steam bath and the solution allowed to cool. The crystalline precipitate of creatinine picrate is filtered off, washed well with cold water, and dried. It forms long needles which melt at 220°; the melting point is unchanged on recrystallization from hot water. The yield is 620–630 g. (89–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To a cooled (0°), stirred suspension of 10.0 g. (0.0395 mole) of aminomalononitrile p-toluenesulfonate2 in 20 ml. of water is added 10.0 g. (0.204 mole) of sodium cyanide in 30 ml. of ice water. One minute after the addition of the sodium cyanide the precipitated product is collected by filtration and washed with 20 ml. of ice water. The solid is immediately dissolved in 30 ml. of boiling isobutyl alcohol, and the solution is stirred with 0.4 g. of Darco activated carbon The mixture is filtered rapidly through 10 g. of Celite filter aid, and the filter cake is washed with 10 ml. of hot isobutyl alcohol. The product that crystallizes on cooling is collected by filtration and washed with 10 ml. of isobutyl alcohol to give 0.95–1.1 g. (22–26%) of white needles, m.p. 181–183° (dec.).
B. Dimethylketene. The apparatus for this preparation consists of a 500-ml. flask equipped with an inlet tube for nitrogen and a dropping funnel and fitted to a 6-in. modified Claisen still head leading to a tared spiral inlet trap having stop-cocks on the inlet and exit sides and cooled in Dry Ice-acetone. This trap is connected to a vacuum line, and the reaction is carried out at 300 mm. pressure. After 40 g. (0.61 g. atom) of zinc turnings and 300 ml. of ethyl acetate have been placed in the flask and the system has been flushed with nitrogen (free of oxygen and moisture) and heated to incipient boiling, 111 g. (0.48 mole) of α-bromoisobutyryl bromide is added dropwise at such a rate that the ethyl acetate boils gently. A slow stream of nitrogen is continued throughout the reaction. Dimethylketene distils along with ethyl acetate and is obtained in 46–54% yield as a 9–10% solution in ethyl acetate (15–18 g. of dimethylketene in 190–200 ml. of ethyl acetate).
The apparatus shown in Fig. 10 is assembled in a good hood. One liter of liquid ammonia and 0.5 g. of hydrated ferric nitrate are placed in the 2-l. three-necked flask A, which is equipped with a stirrer and a special reflux condenser cooled with Dry Ice. This condenser is attached to a soda-lime tower which is connected to a source of compressed air through the T-tube C. Over a period of about 45 minutes, 92 g. (4 gram atoms) of clean sodium shavings is added to the liquid ammonia, and the mixture is stirred until the blue color disappears (1–2 hours).
Ninety-eight grams (1 mole) of cyclohexene oxide is divided into two approximately equal portions; one portion is added to a solution of 121 g. (1.25 moles) of potassium thiocyanate in 100 ml. of water and 75 ml. of 95% ethanol. After standing for 3–4 hours the clear solution is transferred to a 1-l. flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The second portion of oxide is added, and the resulting solution is stirred vigorously for 36 hours at room temperature. The supernatant layer and the aqueous phase are then decanted from the precipitated potassium cyanate into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The potassium cyanate is rinsed with 50 ml. of ether, which is subsequently added to the separatory funnel and used to extract the cyclohexene sulfide. The ether extract is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The excess ether is removed on the steam bath, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through an 18-in. Vigreux column while the distillate is being cooled in ice. The main fraction boils at 71.5–73.5°/21 mm. (69–71°/19 mm.); n25D 1.5306–1.5311. A fore-run, boiling up to 71.5°/21 mm., yields more of the product on redistillation. The total yield of cyclohexene sulfide is 81.5–83.5 g. (71–73%).
The acid is heated just to its boiling point (200–205°), when it decomposes with the evolution of furan and carbon dioxide. The small amounts of 2-furancarboxylic acid that sublime are pushed back from time to time. The distillate is finally redistilled, when it is found to boil at 31–34°/745 mm. The yield is 33–36 g. (72–78 per cent of the theoretical amount based on 2-furancarboxylic acid of 95 per cent purity).
The alcoholic solution of the product is kept for 24 hours at 0° and then poured into 1 l. of ice-cold water. The oily layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ethyl bromide. The combined oil and extracts is washed with ice-cold 2% potassium hydroxide solution, then with very dilute hydrochloric acid, and finally with water. The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residual crude ester is purified by distillation. The yield of ethyl γ-bromobutyrate, obtained as a colorless oil, b.p. 97–99° (25 mm.), n25D 1.4543, is 350–380 g. (77–84%) and.
Two hundred grams (0.95 mole) of u.s.p. citric acid monohydrate is placed in the Kjeldahl flask and heated with a free flame until melted. Then the flask is heated very rapidly with a Meker burner, and the distillation is completed as quickly as possible (ten to twelve minutes). Superheating must be avoided. The distillate consists of water and itaconic anhydride, most of which distils at 175–190°. The distillate is immediately poured into a separatory funnel and the lower layer of itaconic anhydride is separated. The yield of the anhydride is 40–50 g. (37–47 per cent of the theoretical amount). It is of sufficient purity for use in the preparation of citraconic anhydride (p. 140) and.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a 100-cc. dropping funnel, are placed 374 g. (2.8 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 400 cc. of carbon bisulfide. To the stirred suspension is added slowly through the dropping funnel 375 g. (2.5 moles) of phenyl propionate. Reaction sets in almost at once with the evolution of hydrogen chloride, and the carbon bisulfide begins to reflux from the heat of reaction. When all the propionate is in (one and one-half hours is required), the mixture is further heated to gentle refluxing on a steam bath until the evolution of hydrogen chloride has practically ceased (about two hours). The reflux condenser is then turned downward, and the carbon bisulfide is distilled. The steam bath is replaced by an oil bath which is heated to 140° and maintained at 140–150° for three hours. During this period a fresh evolution of hydrogen chloride takes place. The mixture thickens and finally congeals to a brown resinous mass. Stirring is continued as long as possible.
Cholane-24-ol (1.033 g., 3 mmoles) is dissolved by gentle warming in 10 ml. of anhydrous benzene in a 50-ml. flask, and 10 ml. of rigorously dried dimethyl sulfoxide is added. To the clear solution are added 0.24 ml. (3.0 mmoles) of anhydrous pyridine, 0.12 ml. (1.5 mmoles) of distilled trifluoroacetic acid, and 1.85 g. (9 mmoles) of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, in that order. The flask is tightly stoppered and left at room temperature for 18 hours. Benzene (30 ml.) is then added, and the crystalline dicyclohexylurea is removed by filtration and washed with benzene. The combined filtrates and washings are extracted three times with 50-ml. portions of water to remove the dimethyl sulfoxide. The organic layer is dried with sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. There is obtained 2.12 g. of syrup which partially crystallizes. Thin-layer chromatography of this material shows a very intense spot of cholane-24-al, traces of starting material, and two compounds near the solvent front as well as excess carbodiimide.
A. p-Toluenesulfonylanthranilic acid. In a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer extending to the bottom of the flask are placed 1.5 l. of water and 260 g. (2.4 moles) of technical grade dry sodium carbonate. While the mixture is warmed, 137 g. (1 mole) of anthranilic acid is added in three portions, and the temperature is raised to 70° to effect complete solution. The solution is allowed to cool to about 60°, and 230 g. (1.2 moles) of technical p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added in 5 portions over a period of about 20 minutes. When all the p-toluenesulfonyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is maintained at 60–70° for an additional 20 minutes. The temperature is raised to about 85°, 10 g. of Norit is added cautiously, and the solution is filtered by suction through a previously heated Büchner funnel.
A 1-l. beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 1.5 g. of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, 36 g. of sodium hydroxide, 360 ml. of water, 90 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 450 ml. of dioxane. This mixture is cooled to 15° with an ice-water bath and by the addition of a small amount of ice to the mixture before 52.5 g. (0.300 mole) of m-chlorobenzoyl chloride is added in one portion while vigorous stirring is maintained. Small portions of ice are added to maintain the temperature below 25°. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 15 minutes, then transferred to a 3-l. separatory funnel. Cold, 20% sulfuric acid (900 ml.) is added to the separatory funnel, the mixture is shaken and separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with four 200 ml. portions of cold dichloromethane. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the dichloromethane is removed under reduced pressure via a short-path distillation. After most of the solvent has been removed, a white pasty solid remains and the residual solvent is removed under full vacuum for an additional 2 hours or until a white, flaky powder remains. The product weighs approximately 51 g. Sodium thiosulfate analysis indicates 80–85% active oxygen present.
A. 2-Cyanoethylthiouronium hydrochloride (3). To a 5-L, flanged-top, spherical Morton flask equipped with a supporting clamp are added water (380 mL), thiourea (575 g, 7.53 mol), and 3-chloropropionitrile (500 g, 5.58 mol). The flask is equipped with a three-necked (with thermometer inlet) flanged-top, mechanical stirring rod (600 mm) with Teflon paddle (110 mm), temperature probe, reflux condenser, gas bubbler, and 5-L heating mantle. The reaction mixture is slowly heated to 68°C over a 30-min period under nitrogen and maintained at 68-70°C for 1 hr. After 1 hr, the temperature of the reaction mixture is increased over a 15-min period to 100°C and maintained at 100-101°C for 2 hr. After 2 hr, the heating mantle is replaced with a large ice-salt bath, and the reaction mixture is cooled with stirring to 45°C. When the internal temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 45°C, stirring is stopped, the cooling process is continued, and the product is allowed to crystallize. Cold acetone (2 L) is added and the solid is broken up with a spatula and homogenized. The solid is collected using a 160 × 160-mm medium-fritted funnel and washed with 4 L of cold acetone , stirring with the spatula during the filtration process. The solid is then washed with 2 L of ether and air dried. Final drying in a vacuum oven at room temperature affords 693.7 g (75.0%) of the title compound as a white solid, mp 161.5-162.5°C and. The filtrate is placed in a freezer (4°C) for two days. The crystallized product is collected by vacuum filtration, washed with ether (2 × 1 L), air dried, and then dried under vacuum to afford an additional 75.8 g (8.2%) of the title compound, mp 162.5-163.5°C.
B. (S)-(-)-p-Bromophenyl methyl sulfoxide (3). A flame-dried, three-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a rubber septum, a 25-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a thermometer adaptor fitted with a suitable thermometer, and a magnetic stir bar (30 mm length, oval) and is placed under positive nitrogen pressure. The apparatus is charged with (S)-(-)-2-(N-3,5-diiodosalicyliden)amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol (S)-1 (425.8 mg, 0.90 mmol, 1.5 mol%) and 15 mL of CHCl3. A green solution of vanadyl acetylacetonate (VO(acac)2, 159.0 mg, 0.60 mmol, 1.0 mol%) in 15 mL of chloroform is added dropwise via the addition funnel to the stirred bright yellow solution at room temperature over 3 minutes. The stirred translucent solution immediately turns from yellow to green and then finally dark brown as it is left stirring for 30 min at room temperature open to the atmosphere. p-Bromophenyl methyl sulfide (2) (12.19 g, 0.060 mol, 1.0 equiv) is added in one portion to the reaction mixture, followed by CHCl3 (30 mL) and the solution is cooled to 0 °C by means of a cryocool with an isopropanol bath. Once the internal temperature reaches 0 °C (20-30 minutes), an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide (7.75 g of a 31.6% solution in H2O, 0.072 mol, 1.2 equiv) is added dropwise over a period of 25 min via the dropping funnel, keeping the internal temperature between 0-5 °C. The reaction mixture is then kept at 0 °C (± 1 °C) and vigorously stirred for 16 h.
The ethanolic ammonia is added to 49 g. (0.16 mole) of di-n-butylaminoethyl bromide hydrobromide [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 92 (1943)] in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is stoppered tightly and allowed to stand for 6 days at room temperature. The solution is then transferred to an evaporating dish and stirred while it is evaporated to a crystalline paste under a hood. The crystalline paste is transferred to a 400-ml. beaker, and to it is added a solution of 16 g. of sodium hydroxide in 18 ml. of water. The solution separates into an upper layer of brown oil and a lower layer which contains a considerable amount of undissolved sodium bromide. About 10 ml. of water is added to dissolve most of the precipitate. The whole is then extracted with three 50-ml. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are placed in a 250-ml. flask over 15 g. of potassium carbonate and set aside to dry overnight.
A mixture of 100 g. (0.65 mole) of a technical grade of acenaphthene, 5 g. of ceric acetate, and 800 ml. of glacial acetic acid is placed in a 4-l. stainless-steel beaker arranged for external cooling with cold water. A thermometer and a powerful stirrer are inserted, and 325 g. (1.1 mole) of sodium bichromate dihydrate is added over a period of 2 hours, the temperature being kept at 40°. Stirring is then continued at room temperature for an additional 8 hours; during this time the reaction mixture becomes quite thick, owing to the separation of the quinone and chromium salts. The suspension is diluted with 1.5 l. of cold water, and the solid is collected on a 10-in. Büchner funnel and washed free from acid.
A. N,N',N"-Tris(p-tolylsulfonyl)diethylenetriamine (1). A 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer, and addition funnel is charged with 1150 g. (6.037 moles) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and 3 l. of pyridine. The mixture is stirred and warmed to 50°, dissolving the solid; the flask is immersed in a 30° water bath; and a solution of 206 g. (2.00 moles) of diethylenetriamine in 300 ml. of pyridine is added through the addition funnel at a rate that maintains a reaction temperature of 50–60° (1 hour). The reaction mixture is kept at 50–60° for 30 minutes longer, cooled, and divided into two equal portions in 4-l. Erlenmeyer flasks. The pyridine solutions are mechanically stirred as 1000 ml. of water is slowly poured into each. After stirring overnight and cooling in an ice bath for 2 hours, the white solid is collected by filtration, thoroughly washed with ice-cold 95% ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 100°, yielding 950–1015 g. (84–90%) of triamine 1, m.p. 173–175°.
A. Dispiro[5.1.5.1]tetradecane-7,14-dione. Cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride (30.0 g., 0.205 mole) and 250 ml. of dry benzene are placed in a three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, condenser, and dropping funnel. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the system. Dry triethylamine (35.0 g., 0.35 mole) is slowly added, and the mixture is heated under reflux overnight. The amine hydrochloride is then filtered, and the filtrate is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid and with water. Solvent is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is recrystallized from ligroin-ethanol; yield 11–13 g. (49–58%), m.p. 161–62°.
With vigorous mechanical agitation the diazonium salt solution is run into the Chicago acid solution rather rapidly. The blue dye which separates at first, gradually dissolves on further stirring. After one-half hour the solution is tested for alkalinity and for completeness of coupling and.
After all the ethoxide has been added (20–30 minutes) the gelatinous reaction mixture is stirred until no more distillate comes over (15–30 minutes). The weight of this distillate amounts to 38–45 g..
A dry, 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an effective reflux condenser, a 50-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar, and a nitrogen inlet tube on the top of the condenser to maintain a static nitrogen atmosphere in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction. The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen, then charged with 2.40 g. (0.0329 mole) of diethylamine and 100 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, the stirrer is started, and 25 ml. (0.035 mole) of 1.4 M n-butyllithium in hexane and is added carefully through the rubber septum with a syringe. After stirring for 10 minutes, the ice bath is removed and 5.00 g (0.0329 mole) of α-pinene oxide in 20 ml. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise over a 10-minute period. The resulting mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 6 hours. After the clear homogeneous mixture is cooled in an ice bath, it is stirred vigorously while 100 ml. of water is added. The ether phase is separated and washed successively with 100 ml. portions of 1 N hydrochloric acid, water, saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and water. The aqueous phase and each washing are extracted twice with 50 ml. portions of ether, and the ethereal extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent on a rotary evaporator yields a light-yellow, oily residue which is distilled through a short-path distillation head, giving 4.50–4.75 g. (90–95%) of trans-pinocarveol as a colorless oil, b.p. 92–93° (8 mm.) n25D 1.4955 and.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask, 100 g. (0.65 mole) of pure acenaphthene and 72 g. (0.72 mole) of succinic anhydride are dissolved by warming in 600 ml. of nitrobenzene. The flask is clamped in a large ice bath. Through the central opening is inserted a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer. A second opening is connected to a gas trap and also carries a thermometer; the third is for the introduction of aluminum chloride. After the mixture has been cooled to about 0°, 195 g. (1.46 moles) of aluminum chloride is added in small portions in the course of 1 hour, the temperature being kept below 5°. Stirring is continued at 0° for 4 more hours, after which time the mixture is allowed to stand for at least 12 hours so that the ice melts and the clear red solution gradually comes to room temperature.
A mixture of 179 g. (167 ml., 1 mole) of 2-nitro-p-cymene (p. 653), 300 ml. of absolute ethanol, and 3–5 g. of Raney nickel (p. 181) is placed in the steel reaction vessel of a high-pressure hydrogenation apparatus.1 The bomb is then closed, and hydrogen is admitted until the pressure, at 25°, is about 1000 lb. While the bomb is shaken, the temperature is rapidly raised to 80–90°, and then the heater is shut off. Owing to the strong exothermic reaction, the temperature continues to rise, reaching about 120°, while the pressure drops rapidly. The pressure in the reaction vessel is maintained at 700–1500 lb., by the introduction of hydrogen from a tank, until the rapid reaction is over (15 minutes). The reaction mixture is kept at 100–120° for 30 minutes after there is no further drop in the pressure of hydrogen. After the bomb has cooled, the hydrogen is slowly released and the catalyst is separated from the reaction mixture by centrifuging, or by filtration through a sintered-glass or Büchner funnel. The alcohol and water are removed by distillation, and the product is fractionated in a suitable apparatus,,,,.
B. Diethyl cis-hexahydrophthalate. The reaction is carried out in a low-pressure catalytic hydrogenation apparatus.2 In a 500-ml. Pyrex centrifuge bottle are placed 0.5 g. of Adams platinum oxide catalyst and 20 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol. The bottle is connected to a calibrated low-pressure hydrogen tank and alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is then admitted to the system until the pressure is 1–2 atmospheres (15–30 lb.), and the bottle is shaken for 20–30 minutes to reduce the platinum oxide. The shaker is stopped, the bottle is evacuated, and air is admitted. Two hundred and twenty-six grams (1 mole) of diethyl cis-Δ4-tetrahydrophthalate is placed in the bottle. The container in which the ester was weighed is rinsed with 10 ml. of absolute ethanol, which is added to the ester. The bottle is alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is admitted to the system until the pressure is 25–30 lb. (approximately 2 atmospheres), and the bottle is shaken until the pressure drop indicates that the theoretical amount (1 mole) of hydrogen has been taken up and the absorption ceases (3–5 hours). The bottle is evacuated and then air is admitted. The catalyst is removed by filtration through a small Hirsch funnel. The bottle is washed with 15 ml. of alcohol, which is poured through the funnel. Most of the solvent is distilled at 25–35 mm. Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure yields 215–219 g. (94–96%) of diethyl cis-hexahydrophthalate, b.p. 130–132°/ 9 mm., nD25 1.4508–1.4510.
In a 500-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, 5.2 g. (0.22 gram atom) of sodium is dissolved in 100 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol with moderate cooling. The resulting solution of sodium methoxide is cooled to − 5° in a freezing mixture. A solution of 50 g. (0.21 mole) of pure commercial benzoyl peroxide (m.p. 104°) in 200 cc. of chloroform is prepared, cooled to 0°, and added without delay to the sodium methoxide solution with shaking and cooling at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0°. The mixture is kept for four or five minutes in an ice-salt bath with continuous shaking; it turns milky, but no precipitate appears. The reaction mixture is now transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and the sodium perbenzoate is extracted with 500 cc. of water containing much chopped ice. The chloroform layer is then separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-cc. portions of cold chloroform to remove the methyl benzoate. The aqueous solution contains the sodium salt of perbenzoic acid. The perbenzoic acid is liberated by the addition of 225 cc. of cold 1 N sulfuric acid and is removed from solution by extracting three times with 100-cc. portions of cold chloroform. The united chloroform solutions are washed twice with 50-cc. portions of water, and the chloroform layer is carefully separated.
D. (+)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-Phenylcyclohexanol. A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with a mixture of 52.0 g (0.206 mol) of (−)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate, 250 mL of 2 N sodium hydroxide, and 100 mL of methanol and then stirred at reflux for 3 hr. TLC analysis indicates complete reaction. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, adjusted to pH 7 with ca. 35 mL of 3 N sulfuric acid and poured into 500 mL of water. The mixture is extracted with two 150-mL portions of dichloromethane and the organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35°C) to afford 37.0 g of a colorless solid. Recrystallization from 100 mL of petroleum ether (30–60°C) at −20°C gives in two crops, 35.8 g (96% of theory) of (+)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol as colorless needles, mp 60–62°C, [α]D25 + 52.8° (methanol, c 5.4).
B. 1-Phenyl-1-penten-4-yn-3-ol. The stirred solution of ethynylmagnesium bromide is cooled in ice water as there is added dropwise during about 45 minutes a solution of 47.5 g. (0.36 mole) of freshly distilled cinnamaldehyde in 50 ml. of purified tetrahydrofuran. After addition is complete, stirring is continued overnight as the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. The brown homogeneous reaction mixture is added carefully to 1.5 l. of cooled saturated ammonium chloride solution, then the aqueous phase is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined with the tetrahydrofuran solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After evaporation of the solvent, the product is distilled at a pressure of about 0.1 mm., with the heating bath at about 90°. The distillate, which solidifies on cooling, is crystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°) to yield 33–39 g. (58–69%) of the unsaturated alcohol of m.p. 67–68°.
B. Ethyl 2-{[(1S,2R,3R,5S)-2,6,6-trimethylbicyclo[3.1.1]hept-3-yl]methyl}acrylate (2)3,4 (+)-α-Pinene (7.14 mL, 45 mmol), N,N-dimethylacetamide (0.42 mL, 4.5 mmol) and dichloromethane (30 mL) are added to a 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large, oblong magnetic stir bar, a reflux condenser with an argon inlet, a glass stopper, and a straight glass stopcock fitted with rubber septum. The stirred mixture is cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath, and catecholborane (12.0 mL, 113 mmol) is added dropwise via syringe by placing the syringe needle through the septum on the open stopcock. The stopcock is closed, the ice bath is removed and colorless reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 5 h. The mixture is cooled to 0 °C, and methanol (3.0 mL, 74 mmol) is carefully added [CAUTION: vigorous evolution of hydrogen gas] to quench the excess of catecholborane, and the resulting mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 15 min.
B. The flask is cooled to 0°C (ice bath) and 35.3 g (0.285 mol) of 1-octyn-3-one is added. After an initially exothermic reaction, the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature. The reduction can be monitored by gas chromatography, but generally 8 hr is required for completion. The color of the reaction mixture is initially light yellow and darkens to red at the end of the reduction.
The bottle is charged with 52 g. (1.0 mole) of 95% sodium cyanide, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of acetonitrile, giving a two-phase liquid system. After the bottle is clamped in the metal cage of the shaking apparatus, the bottle is evacuated and filled to a gauge pressure of 10 lb. (0.68 atm.) with chlorotrifluoroethylene. This procedure is repeated twice to purge the system of air. Finally, the bottle is pressured to 40 lb. (2.7 atm.), chlorotrifluoroethylene leaving the valve open to maintain this pressure. The thermocouple is fitted into place and shaking is started. The temperature steadily increases, and in 10–15 minutes it is about 75° and rising more rapidly. It is kept at 75–80° by cooling and/or slowing the rate of chlorotrifluoroethylene addition. Caution! Careful control of the reaction is mandatory. If the reaction rate cannot be controlled, it is imperative to shut the gas addition valve and to stop the agitation immediately. Cooling is accomplished by packing ice inside the wire cage holding the bottle and/or pouring ice water on the bottle. When cooling is used, it is possible to complete the reaction in 1 hour. When the rate of chlorotrifluoroethylene absorption is negligible and the temperature is about 30°, pressure is released through the bleed line and the bottle is removed. The gain in weight is 130–135 g. (about 1.1 moles).
B. (R)-(−)-3-Hydroxybutanoic acid. In a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a precision-ground stirrer and a coil condenser bearing a distillation bridge, are placed 200 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane and 50 g (0.58 mol) of PHB. The mixture is stirred and heated at 150°C until a milky solution is formed. p-Toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (2.5 g, 0.013 mol) is added and the solution heated an additional 30 min at 150°C. A total amount of 9.3 g (11.8 mL, 0.29 mol) of methanol is then added carefully through the condenser to the boiling solution in approx 1-mL portions. The light brown, cloudy solution is heated at reflux (oil bath, 140°C) for another 48 hr. The oil bath temperature is reduced to 130°C and 60 mL of water is carefully added. The resulting two-phase mixture is heated for another 4 hr. Methanol, 1,2-dichloroethane, and approx 150 mL of water are removed by distillation through the condenser within 1–2 hr. During the distillation nine 30-mL portions of water are added; the resulting homogeneous aqueous solution is heated at reflux for another 4 hr. During this period the temperature of the oil bath is increased to 180°C. Methanol/water (50 mL) is removed by distillation and, after the addition of 50 mL of water, the solution is again heated at reflux for 15 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 30°C, followed by the addition of 0.6 g (0.015 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 10 mL of water. Water is first removed in a rotary evaporator at a maximum temperature of 30°C, 15 mm, followed by drying at 0.1 mm. The residue is dissolved in 250 mL of ether, the solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated in a rotary evaporator and dried at 0.1 mm. The resulting light-brown clear oil is distilled at 80–100°C (air bath)/10−3mm by bulb to bulb distillation. The crude product is either crystalline or a colorless oil that crystallizes upon standing at room temperature. After the crystals are crushed in a mortar, they are dried for 2 days in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), to yield 32 g (53%) of (R)-3-hydroxybutanoic acid, mp 44–46°C, [α]DRT −24.7° (H2O, c 5.0,,.
A 1-l., three-necked flask is fitted with an acetone-dry ice condenser, a glass stirrer, and a glass stopper. Potassium amide is prepared in 400 ml. of liquid ammonia with 8.0 g. (0.20 g.-atom) of potassium metal. The glass stopper is replaced with an addition funnel containing 32.1 g. (0.300 mole) of 2,6-lutidine dissolved in ca. 20 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The lutidine solution is added. to the amide solution, and the funnel is rinsed with a little ether, which is also added. The resulting orange potassiolutidine solution is stirred for 30 minutes, then cooled in an acetone–dry-ice bath. As rapidly as possible, 11.8 g. (0.100 mole) of freshly distilled diethyl carbonate is added, the cooling bath is removed, and the solution changes to a green color. After 5 minutes the reaction mixture is neutralized by the addition of 10.7 g. (0.200 mole) of ammonium chloride. The green color is discharged; the final mixture is gray. The condenser is removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is stirred with 500 ml. of ether, filtered, and extracted with an additional 100 ml. of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and the residual oil is distilled using a modified Claisen flask. 2,6-Lutidine (22 g., 69%) is collected at 46–56° (10 mm.), and 10.7–13.4 g. (59–75%) of the ester is collected at 87° (0.7 mm.) as a bright yellow liquid, n25D 1.4995, d204 1.0608.
After the reaction is complete as judged by GC analysis, hydrazine hydrate (30 mL) is added in one portion and the flask is heated in an oil bath (125 °C) for 5 h. At this point, the argon atmosphere is no longer required. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature followed by the addition of water (100 mL) and dichloromethane (50 mL). The mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. Additional water (200 mL) and dichloromethane (100 mL) are added to the separatory funnel. After separation of the organic layer, the water layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 150 mL). Magnesium sulfate (about 12 g) is directly placed in a 150-mL Büchner filter funnel with a medium porosity fritted disk. A round-bottomed flask (1-L) is connected to the filter funnel and the combined organic phase is filtered through the MgSO4 layer. The combined organic extracts are not treated with MgSO4 beforehand. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 15 mm Hg). Following concentration, 120-130 mL of the crude product solution in DMA is left in the flask. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The solvent is removed by vacuum distillation (1.6 mm Hg) through a 4-cm column to a 200-mL round-bottomed receiver flask. The boiling point of DMA is 38-39 °C /1.6 mmHg; the temperature of the oil bath is kept at 65-70 °C. After the distillation is complete the temperature inside the distillation apparatus drops to about 23 °C. The distillation residue is diluted with 10 mL of chromatography eluent mixture (hexanes/dichloromethane; 1/2). The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (5 × 19 cm, 200 g of silica gel), using hexanes/dichloromethane (1/2) as the eluent (900 mL). The first fractions are blank, followed by fractions containing minor amounts of impure and then pure product. The elution is continued with 5% ethyl acetate/dichloromethane (about 1.1 L collected). After concentration of the fractions containing pure product, the residue is dried under reduced pressure (1.0 mmHg) at room temperature for 24 h to yield the arylated heterocycle. The pure product (6.15 g, 94%) is obtained as an air stable, light brown oil.
C. α-Chlorophenylacetic acid. A solution of 119 g. (0.6 mole) of ethyl α-chlorophenylacetate in 238 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 119 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, is heated under reflux in a hood for 1.5 hours. At the end of the heating period the solution is concentrated by heating in an oil bath at 100° at reduced pressure (15–20 mm.) until no further material is distilled. The residue is allowed to cool to room temperature and poured slowly, with stirring, into 1-l. of ice-cold saturated sodium bicarbonate solution contained in a 2-l. beaker. Solid sodium bicarbonate is added in small portions until the solution becomes neutral to universal indicator paper. The solution is then extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether in a 2-l. separatory funnel,. The aqueous phase is placed in a 3-l. beaker and acidified cautiously with ice-cold 12N sulfuric acid until the mixture is acid to Congo red paper. The oily suspension is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether in a 2-l. separatory funnel. The ether extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over 45 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried ether extract is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and concentrated on a steam bath until ether is no longer distilled. To the residue there is added 500 ml. of warm (50–60°) concentrated hydrochloric acid (in a hood), and the suspension is allowed to cool with occasional swirling. Crystallization is completed by chilling in ice, and the product is collected on a sintered-glass funnel. After the product has been dried as much as possible on the funnel it is dried to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator over solid potassium hydroxide. The yield of dry acid is 82–84 g. (80–82%), m.p. 77.5–79.5°. It is satisfactory for most purposes. If very pure material is desired the acid may be recrystallized from three volumes of hexane to give material, m.p. 78.5–79.5°, in 90–95% recovery.
The combined product, weighing 410-420 g., is recrystallized from an equal weight of hot water containing 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The color is removed by the addition of 5 g. of Norite. By suitably concentrating the mother liquors, second, third, and fourth crops may be obtained, all of which appear to be of the same purity as the first crop. The total yield is 360–370 g. (55-57 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 258–260° (corr.) and containing negligible amounts of calcium. The final residue, amounting to 20–30 g., leaves a considerable quantity of ash on ignition.
B. 5,11-Dibromo-5,6,11,12-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]-cyclooctene (2).Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condensor and a 4-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, 1 (19.2 g, 92.3 mmol) is dissolved in carbon tetrachloride (200 mL). NBS (35.3 g, 198.4 mmol, 2.15 equiv) is added, and the stirred mixture is then refluxed at 85 °C (oil bath temperature). After 2 h NMR analysis indicates complete consumption of the starting material 1. The hot suspension (65 °C) is filtered through a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), and the remaining succinimide is washed with carbon tetrachloride (400 mL). The solvent of the filtrate is evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 °C, 225 to 18 mmHg). A pale yellow residue remains, which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask, poured into a fritted glass funnel (7.0 cm diameter, porosity 3), washed with distilled water (300 mL) and dried overnight under vacuum (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg) to give 35.4 g of crude 2 as a pale yellow solid.
C. Trimethylsilylacetylene. A solution of chlorotrimethylsilane (152 mL, 130 g, 1.197 mol) in dry THF (100 mL) is placed in the 1-L dropping funnel and is added (20 min) to the cooled and stirred solution of ethynylmagnesium chloride at a rate sufficient to maintain a reaction temperature of about 15–20°C. Finally, the dropping funnel is replaced by an efficient double-surface condenser and calcium chloride drying tube, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hr. The reflux condenser is replaced by a distillation head and a double surface condenser is connected to a receiver flask which is cooled in an ice bath. The reaction mixture is distilled under nitrogen with stirring until all the azeotrope of trimethylsilylacetylene and THF (700–800 mL, bp ca. 66°C) has distilled and. The distillate is washed with ice–water portions (10 × 500 mL) to remove the THF. Washing is continued until the organic layer stays constant in volume. Distillation of the organic layer under an atmosphere of nitrogen through a short Vigreux column gives trimethylsilylacetylene, bp 50–52°C/760mm, nD20 1.391; (lit.2,3,4 53.5°C at 762 mm, nD20 1.3900; 52°C at 760 mm, nD20 1.3900; 52°C at 760 mm, nD20 1.3935) in yields ranging from 72.5 g (62%) to 87.5 g (75%) and.

To 500 ml. of t-butyl alcohol in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient sealed stirrer, a nitrogen inlet, a 500-ml. dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing side tube, and a reflux condenser there is added 20 g. (0.5 g. atom) of clean potassium metal. After the potassium has reacted, the condenser is replaced by a 12-in. distillation column and the excess t-butyl alcohol is removed by distillation until crystals begin to form in the solution. There is added 2 l. of dry heptane and the distillation is continued until the head temperature reaches 98° and. The residual mixture is adjusted to a 1.5-l. volume by addition of dry heptane and the resulting slurry of potassium t-butoxide in heptane is cooled to 0–5° in an ice bath.
D. (3S, 4E)-Methyl 3-(dimethylphenylsilyl)-4-hexenoate (4a) . A stirred solution of 6.0 g (29.11 mmol) of alcohol 3a and 60 mL of dry toluene in a 200-mL flask equipped with a reflux condenser is treated with 15 mL (116.89 mmol) of trimethyl orthoacetate and 0.15 mL (2.01 mmol, 0.07 equiv) of propionic acid. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 48 hr and then allowed to cool to room temperature. Solvents and volatile material are removed under reduced pressure to leave the crude (E)-crotylsilane 4a as a yellow oil. The crude residue is chromatographed on silica gel (gradient elution 5% EtOAc/hexanes ). The eluant affords 6.58 g (25.1 mmol, 86%) of pure 4a as a faint yellow, viscous oil, and.
B. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole. An oven-dried, 500-mL, 3-necked flask equipped with a 3.0 cm × 1.4 cm, egg-shaped, teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, an internal thermometer, a glass stopper and a reflux condenser (central neck) equipped with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold is assembled hot and cooled under a stream of argon. The flask is charged with 2-bromo-N-[(1S)-1-(hydroxymethyl)-2,2-dimethylpropyl]-benzamide (9.85 g, 32.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv), dichloromethane (170 mL, 0.19 M), and triethylamine (11.0 mL, 78.6 mmol, 2.40 equiv) under a positive pressure of argon. The resulting colorless solution is cooled to approximately 4 °C in an ice-water bath and neat methanesulfonyl chloride (2.92 mL, 37.7 mmol, 1.15 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe over 3 min, at which point the solution turns slightly yellow. The reaction is warmed to reflux (50 °C oil bath temperature) while monitoring conversion by TLC. Upon completed cyclization, the reaction is allowed to cool to ambient temperature and 60 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added with vigorous stirring for 5 min. The layers are partitioned in a 1-L separatory funnel, the aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 35 mL), the combined organic phases are washed with saturated brine (75 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (1.50 g), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 °C, 23 mmHg) to afford a red-brown semi-solid. The residue is dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane (ca. 35 mL), dry-loaded onto silica gel (8 g), and purified by silica gel chromatography to afford 8.85-8.86 g (31.4 mmol, 96% yield) of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4-(1,1-dimethyl-ethyl)-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole as a pale yellow oil. This material solidifies when placed in a -20 °C freezer and is preferred in this state for the subsequent reaction.
C. (1S)-(−)-1,3-Dithiane 1-oxide . A mixture of anti- and syn-1S-2-(2,2-dimethylpropanoyl)-1,3-dithiane 1-oxide (33 g, 0.150 mol) is dissolved in 500 mL of ethanol, and 200 mL of aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide is added. The mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hr. The mixture is allowed to cool, and 500 mL of dichloromethane is added. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted four times, with 100 mL of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure to give a beige solid. The solid is triturated with diethyl ether to give 13 g (64%) of 1S-(−)-1,3-dithiane 1-oxide as a colorless solid, mp 90-92°C and.
One kilogram (862 cc., 10.2 moles) of furfural is placed in a 4-l. copper can provided with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The stirrer is started and the furfural is cooled to 5–8°. When the temperature has fallen to this range, 825 g. of 33.3 per cent technical sodium hydroxide solution is added from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 20°. This requires twenty to twenty-five minutes. The rate of addition will depend on the efficiency of the cooling. The stirring is continued for one hour after the addition of the sodium hydroxide solution.
A solution of 162 g. (1.5 moles) of commercial o-toluidine in 880 cc. (6 moles) of 40 per cent commercial hydrobromic acid in a 3-l. flask is cooled to 10° and diazotized with 116 g. (1.7 moles) of coarsely powdered commercial sodium nitrite, added about 10 g. at a time. After each addition the flask is stoppered and shaken until all the red fumes are absorbed. The temperature must be kept below 10°. When diazotization is complete, 5 g. of copper powder is added, the flask is attached to a reflux condenser and heated very cautiously. As soon as the first sign of reaction is observed, the flask is cooled with ice. Nitrogen is evolved vigorously. When the reaction subsides, the mixture is heated one-half hour on the steam bath.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel 832 g. (4.0 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride is stirred with 250 ml. of phosphorus oxychloride. To this is added with stirring 264 g. (272 ml., 4.4 moles) of methyl formate. During the addition the reaction vessel is cooled in an ice bath to maintain a reaction temperature of 10–20°. The addition requires about 1.75 hours. When the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at a temperature under 30° until all the phosphorus pentachloride has dissolved (about 1 hour). Then the stirrer is removed, the reflux condenser is replaced by a distilling head, and the reaction mixture is distilled under a pressure of 80–120 mm. with a bath temperature of 50–65°. During the distillation the receiver is cooled to −10° to −20° by an ice-salt bath.
After addition of the acetaldehyde solution is complete, the product is decomposed by pouring the reaction mixture onto 2 kg. of cracked ice. The excess magnesium may be removed conveniently by decantation at this point. The basic magnesium halide is dissolved by addition of about 1 l. of 15 per cent sulfuric acid. The ether solution is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with four 150-cc. portions of ether. The ether solutions are combined, dried over 25 g. of calcined potassium carbonate, filtered, and fractionally distilled, using a short column. The methyl isopropyl carbinol distils at 110–111.5°. The fraction boiling at 37–109° should be dried and refractionated. The total yield is 210–215 g. (53–54 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 50-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped by a rubber septum, an efficient reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen inlet, and a magnetic stirrer is charged with 7.02 g. (0.0500 mole) of α-chloro-p-xylene and 45.6 g. (0.633 mole) of ethyl vinyl ether. A solution of 7.06 g. (0.0501 mole) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine in 15 ml. of dry diethyl ether is injected through the septum into the dropping funnel. Lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide is generated in situ by injecting 46.5 ml. (0.0502 mole) of a 1.08 M solution of methyllithium in ether through the septum over a 5–10-minute period and. After another 10 minutes, the contents are added dropwise to the vigorously stirred solution in the flask at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux. When the ca. 2-hour addition period is complete, the white slurry is stirred overnight at room temperature. Water (10 ml.) is added dropwise to the stirred suspension, and the contents of the flask are poured into a separatory funnel containing 100 ml. of ether and 100 ml. of water. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed successively with 10% aqueous citric acid, 5% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and water, dried with anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered and evaporated with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled at reduced pressure, affording 6.6–7.0 g. (75–80%) of 1-ethoxy-2-p-tolylcyclopropane, b.p. 116–118° (10 mm.), 95–96° (3.2 mm.).
B. 1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-ethoxy-2,3-epoxy-5-phenylpentane (4). A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring and with a condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, is charged with 9.76 g (40 mmol) of 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-ethoxy-5-phenyl-2-pentene (3) , and a solution of 14.79 g (60 mmol) of 70% meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid in 170 mL of dichloromethane and. The resulting mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 20 hr, cooled, and concentrated to 50-60 mL under reduced pressure. The residual liquid is diluted with 200 mL of pentane and the supernatant liquid from the resulting suspension is passed through a short silica gel column. The residual solids are washed twice with 50 mL of a 10:1 mixture (v/v) of pentane-diethyl ether , and the wash solutions are passed through the same column. The column is then eluted with 100 mL of a 5:1 (v/v) mixture of pentane-diethyl ether . The combined eluants are concentrated under reduced pressure and the residual liquid is purified by bulb-to-bulb vacuum distillation (oven temperature 120-130°C at 10 mm) to provide 9.36-9.88 g (90-95%) of pure 1,1,1-trifluoro-2-ethoxy-2,3-epoxy-5-phenylpentane (4) as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 90°C (10 mm).
B. 3-Ethenyl-4-methoxycyclobutene-1,2-dione (2). A 2-L, flame-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and nitrogen bubbler is charged with 10.0 g (70.4 mmol) of dimethyl squarate, 1 , and 1 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). The stirred solution is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath at −78°C, and 39.0 mL (91.7 mmol) of vinyllithium (2.35 M) and is added via syringe in four portions to the dimethyl squarate solution. After the addition is complete, the yellow solution is stirred for 2 hr, whereupon 14.8 mL (105 mmol) of trifluoroacetic anhydride is added dropwise via syringe. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for 30 min and quenched by pouring the cold solution into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of aqueous ammonium chloride (10%) (NH4Cl) and 500 mL of ethyl acetate . The separatory funnel is shaken vigorously and allowed to warm to room temperature. The aqueous layer is removed and washed twice with 200 mL of ethyl acetate . The combined organic layers are washed with 400 mL of brine and dried over solid anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The solution is filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil is dissolved in 30 mL of ethyl acetate and purified by flash chromatography (9.5 × 45.0-cm column) through silica gel (400 g, 32-63 microns) using hexanes/ethyl acetate (7/3) to yield 6.55 g (67%) of the title compound 2 as yellow crystals,, and (mp 59-61°C).
(B) ε-Benzoylaminocaproic Acid.—The rearrangement of 100 g. (0.88 mole) of pure cyclohexanone oxime is carried out in the following way. In a 1-l. beaker are placed a 10-g. portion of the oxime and 20 cc. of 85 per cent sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.783). The beaker is heated with a low flame and the contents are mixed with a rotary motion until bubbles first appear. The beaker is then removed from the flame immediately, and the violent reaction, which lasts a few seconds, is allowed to subside. The acid solution of ε-caprolactam is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, and another 10-g. portion of the oxime is placed in the beaker and rearranged with sulfuric acid as before. The combined acid solution from the ten operations is diluted with 2.5 l. of water and boiled gently for one and one-half hours with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon. The solution is filtered and exactly neutralized to litmus with 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. About 510 g. of sodium hydroxide solution is usually required. The neutral solution is boiled for one-half hour with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtered.
C. (E)-4-Hexen-1-ol. A dry, 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 53 g. (2.3 g.-atoms) of finely divided sodium and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. 3-Chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran (136 g., 1.01 moles) is added dropwise to the rapidly stirred, ethereal suspension of sodium. When the reaction commences, the reaction mixture turns blue. After the reaction has started, the remaining chloro-ether is added, dropwise and with stirring over approximately 90 minutes, at such a rate that a brisk reflux is maintained. The resulting mixture, which remains dark blue throughout the addition of the chloro-ether, is refluxed with stirring for an additional hour, then cooled in an ice–salt bath. The cold reaction mixture is stirred vigorously as 30 ml. of absolute ethanol is added dropwise and with caution to the reaction mixture, after which, 700 ml. of water is added dropwise, with stirring and cooling. After the organic layer has been separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 89–94 g. (88–93%) of (E)-4-hexen-1-ol as a colorless liquid, b.p. 70–74° (19 mm.), nD25 1.4389.
The liquid is stirred vigorously, and a solution of 60.0 g. (0.566 mole) of sodium carbonate in 350 ml. of water is added to the flask as rapidly as the concomitant evolution of carbon dioxide will permit. Stirring is continued for about 15 minutes after the addition is complete. The original reaction vessel is rinsed with 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–75°), the rinse is added to the Erlenmeyer flask containing the product, and the mixture is stirred for about 10 minutes at a rate sufficient to achieve homogenization. The resulting loose emulsion is quickly transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and allowed to separate; the lower (aqueous) phase is drawn off into the original Erlenmeyer flask and the upper (organic) layer containing the desired product is transferred to a 500-ml. flask. In exactly the same manner the aqueous phase is extracted by vigorous stirring with two 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether, the organic layers being added to the retention flask. The combined organic layers are transferred from the flask to the same separatory funnel and shaken once with 100 ml. of cold, 5%, aqueous sodium carbonate and twice with 50-ml. portions of cold water. The organic layer is returned to the retention flask, dried over 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered by gravity, concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and distilled under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column, yielding 75–82 g. (66–73%, based on diethyl fumarate) of the product, b.p. 129–132° (5 mm.), n25D 1.4565–1.4570, d254 1.0584–1.0589.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube, a mechanical stirrer, and a ground-glass stopper is charged with 28.2 g. (0.184 mole) of freshly distilled methyl bromoacetate, 500 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylacetamide, and 20.0 g. (0.168 mole) of methyl nitroacetate. The solution is stirred vigorously while 146 ml. (0.168 mole) of 1.15 N sodium methoxide in methanol is added in one portion. The resulting light-yellow suspension is stirred for an additional 16 hours at room temperature during which time it changes into a clear yellow solution.
[2-(4-Fluorophenyl-1H-indol-4-yl]-1-pyrrolidinylmethanone 4. To a 1-liter glass-lined pressure tube was added sequentially {2-[trans-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-vinyl]-3-nitrophenyl}-1-pyrrolidinylmethanone 3 (8.00 g, 23.5 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (54 mg, 0.235 mmol, 0.01 equiv), 1,10-phenanthroline (300 mg, 1.65 mmol, 0.07 equiv), and DMF (80 mL). The resulting reaction vessel is inserted into a Rocker Assembly and purged with N2 (60 psi) three times. The mixture is then purged with CO (60 psi) three times, and the final pressure set to 50 psi at continuous flow. The mixture is then heated to a jacket temperature of 80 °C and stirred at this temperature for 16 h. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the system is vented to atmospheric pressure. The vessel is pressurized with N2 (60 psi) and vented three times to remove all residual amounts of CO. The reaction mixture is then filtered through 10 grams of Celite in a 150-mL fritted-glass funnel of medium porosity into a single-necked flask rinsing both the reaction flask and the filter cake with DMF (60 mL). To the yellowish-orange filtrate is added a stir bar and the flask is equipped with a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The addition funnel is charged with 1 M H3PO4 (225 mL, Note 30) and 75 mL of this solution is added to the DMF solution over 15 min, at which point the solution becomes turbid and the product begins to crystallize. The resulting slurry is stirred for 30 min and the remaining 1 M H3PO4 (150 mL) is added over 15 min. The slurry of the product is stirred an additional 30 min and is filtered through a 150-mL, medium-porosity fritted-glass funnel. The wet solid is washed with water (2 × 100 mL) and then is dried under a vacuum/N2 sweep for 8 h to provide [2-(4-fluorophenyl-1H-indol-4-yl]-1-pyrrolidinylmethanone 4 as an off-white crystalline solid (6.92 g, 96%).
In a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer are placed 700 ml. of formic acid (88%) and 140 ml. of hydrogen peroxide (30%, 1.37 moles). While the temperature is kept at 35–40°, 116.2 g. (117.3 ml., 1.00 mole) of indene (98%) is added dropwise, with stirring, over a period of 2 hours. An additional 100 ml. of formic acid is used to rinse the last of the indene from the dropping funnel into the reaction flask. The reaction solution is stirred at room temperature for 7 hours to ensure complete reaction. The solution is transferred to a 2- or 3-l. Claisen flask, and the formic acid is removed under aspirator pressure (b.p. 35–40°/20–30 mm.), care being taken to maintain the boiler temperature below 60°. The residue, after being cooled to room temperature, is a yellowish brown crystalline solid, the color being due to contamination by a small amount of brownish oil.
The solution of benzylmagnesium chloride is cooled with running water, and 456 g. (2 moles) of n-butyl p-toluenesulfonate dissolved in about twice its volume of anhydrous ether is then added slowly with stirring through the separatory funnel at such a rate that the ether just boils. The time required for the addition is about two hours. A white solid soon forms and the mixture assumes the consistency of a thick cream. Stirring is continued, without cooling, for about two hours, and the mixture is hydrolyzed by pouring onto crushed ice to which is then added about 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid.
D. N-Benzyl-3-(Z/E)-ethylideneazetidin-2-one . Into a dry, 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, is placed 9.60 g (0.047 mol) of N-benzyl-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)azetidin-2-one , 125 mL of dry dichloromethane, and 13.0 mL (0.093 mol) of triethylamine . The solution is cooled in an ice bath before 4.0 mL (0.052 mol) of methanesulfonyl chloride is introduced. The mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (2 × 150 mL) and brine (200 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure to leave 14.3 of orange oil.
When the reaction mixture has cooled, the contents of the flask are poured into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask containing 400 ml. of distilled water. The reaction flask and stirrer are thoroughly washed with an additional 100 ml. of distilled water, with the washings added to the bulk of the reaction mixture. The aqueous mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 15 minutes to ensure completion of hydrolysis and precipitation of inorganic salts. After the salts are removed by filtration under reduced pressure and discarded, the filtrate is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and the excess acetylacetone is separated. The aqueous phase is washed with five 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether and transferred to a 1-l. conical flask. Nitrogen is blown through the solution for 15 minutes to remove traces of ether. The aqueous solution is then acidified to pH 3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid, with the flask being constantly swirled during addition of the acid, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes to ensure complete precipitation of the product. The crude material is collected by filtration under reduced pressure, washed with 25 ml. of distilled water, and dried under reduced pressure over phosphorus pentoxide, giving 21–22 g. (76–80%) of crude product, m.p. 138–145°. Recrystallization from a mixture of 50 ml. of methanol and 100 ml. of water gives 19.5–21 g. (71–76%) of pure material as colorless prisms, m.p. 142–144.5°.
The reaction mixture is allowed to cool. The dropping funnel, thermometer, and Vigreux column are replaced with a stopper and short-path distillation head. The mixture is stirred while the excess phenol is removed by distillation at water-aspirator pressure; b.p. 105–110° (14 mm.). When the temperature begins to rise above 110° (14 mm.), the distillation is stopped and the residue is allowed to cool.
The filtrate is washed 3 times with distilled water to remove excess acetonitrile and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration followed by removal of ether leaves the product 4 as a yellow oil (7.1–7.6 g, 64–70%), which may be further purified by short path or bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 30°C at 0.1 mm) to a colorless liquid and.
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a 500-cc. separatory funnel, a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser, are placed 36.5 g. (1.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings and 500 cc. of absolute ether. A solution of 206 g. (1.5 moles) of n-butyl bromide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 28, 37) in 250 cc. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. The stirrer is started, and 10–15 cc. of the bromide solution is allowed to flow into the flask from the funnel; the reaction generally begins within a few minutes. As soon as refluxing is vigorous, the flask is surrounded by ice and water and the rate of addition of the bromide is adjusted so that moderate refluxing occurs. After all the solution has been added (thirty to forty minutes), the cooling bath is removed. Stirring is continued for fifteen minutes longer, after which only a small residue of unreacted magnesium remains.
Two hundred forty cubic centimeters (5.7 moles) of c.p. fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50) is added to 1.4 l. of concentrated c.p. sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in a 3-l. beaker, and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. As soon as the temperature of the mixed acids reaches 12°, 200 g. (1.36 moles) of commercial phthalimide is stirred in as rapidly as possible while the temperature of the nitrating mixture is kept between 10° and 15°. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature in the ice bath as the ice melts, and left overnight.
C. 4-tert-Butyl-1-vinylcyclohexene. A dry, 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet, and a condenser is charged with 1.18 g (1.02 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), 12.9 g (0.305 mol) of lithium chloride, and 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran. This mixture is stirred for 15 min under a static argon atmosphere; then a solution of 28.0 g (0.0979 mol) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexen-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate and 19.0 g (0.0997 mol) of trimethylvinyltin in 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added, followed by an additional 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The resulting, almost colorless solution is heated to a gentle reflux for 48 hr. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and partitioned between 500 mL of water and 250 mL of pentane. The aqueous layer is back-extracted with two 200-mL portions of pentane. The combined organic layers are washed with two 250-mL portions each of a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution, water, and a concentrated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered through a 4 × 4-cm pad of silica gel and concentrated by distillation using a 10-cm Vigreux column. Bulb-to-bulb distillation of the resulting yellow oil at 65–68°C (0.55 mm) gives 12.6–12.8 g (78–79%) of the coupled product.
While the diazotization is being carried out the cuprous chloride solution (A) is cooled to 0°. The cold diazonium solution is now poured rapidly into the well-stirred cuprous chloride solution. The solution becomes very thick, owing to the separation of an addition product between the diazonium salt and the cuprous chloride. The cold mixture is allowed to warm up to room temperature, and stirring is continued for two and one-half to three hours at this temperature. When the temperature reaches about 15°, the solid addition compound begins to break down with the formation of nitrogen and o-chlorotoluene. After the specified time the solution is placed on a steam bath and heated to 60° to complete the decomposition of the addition product. The o-chlorotoluene forms a layer on top of the copper salt solution. The water solution is drawn off through a siphon until only 5–6 l. remains. The remaining material is steam-distilled from a 12-l. round-bottomed flask until about 3.5–4 l. is collected in the distillate. The o-chlorotoluene layer is separated from the water, washed with cold concentrated sulfuric acid and then with water, and finally dried over calcium chloride. The product boiling at 155–158° weighs 375–400 g. 74–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. (E)-(2-Methyl-1,3-butadienyl)dimethylalane. An oven-dried, 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and an outlet connected to a mercury bubbler is charged with 7.01 g (24 mmol) of dichlorobis (η5-cyclopentadienyl)zirconium and flushed with nitrogen. To this are added sequentially at 0°C 100 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane, 12.48 g (120 mmol) of a 50% solution of 1-buten-3-yne in xylene, and 120 mL (240 mmol) of a 2 M solution of trimethylalane in toluene. The reaction mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature and used in the next step without further treatment.
B. 2,3-Di-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol. (See.) In a dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a large magnetic stirring bar is suspended lithium aluminum hydride (36 g, 0.95 mol) in diethyl ether (600 mL) under argon. The mixture is stirred and heated to reflux for 30 min. Heating is discontinued while a solution of dimethyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-tartrate (123 g, 0.564 mol) in diethyl ether (300 mL) is added dropwise over 2 hr. Heating is then resumed and the mixture is refluxed for an additional 3 hr. The mixture is cooled to 0–5°C and cautiously treated with water (36 mL), 4 N sodium hydroxide solution (36 mL), and water (112 mL). The mixture is then stirred at room temperature until the gray color of unquenched lithium aluminum hydride has completely disappeared. The mixture is filtered on a Büchner funnel and the inorganic precipitate is extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and volatile material is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator). The residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum to afford the product as a colorless to pale-yellow oil, bp 94–106°C (0.4 mm); 50.2–60.3 g (0.31–0.37 mmol, 54–66% yield) and.
Another portion of LDA is prepared as described above except that this time 12.6 g of diisopropylamine (17.6 mL, 124.6 mmol) in THF (50 mL) and 78.0 mL (124.8 mmol) of 1.6 M butyllithium/hexane are used. The LDA solution is added, through a cannula, to the ethylated bicyclic lactam solution and the mixture is allowed to warm to 0°C; it is kept at this temperature for 3.0 hr. The solution is cooled to −75° to −80°C in a dry ice–acetone bath. A solution of 9.4 g of freshly distilled allyl bromide (6.8 mL, 77.6 mmol) in dry THF (50 mL) is prepared in a 100-mL, oven-dried conical flask flushed with argon and sealed with a rubber septum. This solution is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath and slowly added to the reaction mixture through a cannula. After addition of the allyl bromide, the mixture is kept in a dry ice–acetone bath for 2.5 hr; then the bath is replaced by acetone at −50°C, which is allowed to warm to −30°C within a period of 45 min. The reaction is terminated by pouring it into 1 N hydrochloric acid (as above), extracting with ether, washing with sodium bicarbonate–brine, drying over magnesium sulfate, and evaporating the solvents. The viscous or solid residue is dissolved in methylene chloride (10 mL), and petroleum ether (30–60°C) (140 mL) is added. The product is allowed to crystallize at room temperature for 1 hr, then at −15°C overnight, to give 13.5 g (74%, mp 90–92°C) of a 9 : 1 mixture of diastereoisomers.
When the sodium salt has been sucked dry, it is returned to the 5-l. flask and treated with 1.5 l. of water and 1 kg. of cracked ice. The stirrer is started and there is added rapidly a cold sulfuric acid solution made by adding enough ice to 200 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) so that some of the ice is not melted. The stirring is continued for five or ten minutes or until the yellow lumps of the sodium salt disappear. The mixture is then extracted with three 600-cc. portions of benzene. The benzene is distilled from the extracts on a water bath and the residue is transferred to a special 2-l. Claisen flask (p. 130) and distilled under diminished pressure. The product boils at 130–132°/37 mm. or 117–119°/29 mm. A small high-boiling fraction is redistilled to yield 20–30 g. more of the ethyl acetopyruvate. The total yield is 480–520 g. (61–66 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A solution of sodium methoxide is prepared from 50 g. (2.17 g. atoms) of freshly cut sodium and 600 ml. of absolute methanol in a 3-l. three-necked flask placed on a steam bath and equipped with a sealed stirrer, dropping funnel, and a condenser set downward for distillation. To the stirred solution is added in one portion 344 g. (4.0 moles) of γ-butyrolactone, and the flask is heated until methanol distils at a rapid rate. After 475 ml. of methanol is collected, a filter flask or other suitable device equipped with a side arm is connected to the condenser. This receiver is surrounded by an ice bath, and reduced pressure from an aspirator is applied cautiously (frothing) with continuous stirring. An additional 50–70 ml. of methanol is collected in this way. The residue presumably is dibutyrolactone.
In an assembly similar to that used for the previous reaction, 90 g. (0.67 mole) of dimethylbenzylamine, 0.13 g. of hydroquinone, and 500 ml. of water are stirred and heated at 50°. The crude bromohexadiene (107 g., 0.67 mole) is added in the course of 20–40 minutes, and stirring and heating are maintained at 50° for 2–2.5 more hours. The flask is then fitted for downward distillation, and the mixture is distilled at about 40–50° and 30 mm. until no more oil distils with the water. A total of 133–200 ml. of distillate is collected. This is discarded.
The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed once with 1.5 l. of water, once with 1.5 l. of 1% sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally with 1.5 l. of water. It is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and fractionated at atmospheric pressure from an oil bath using a Vigreux column 1 ft. in length. The fraction boiling at 154–155°/759 mm. is collected. The yield is approximately 818 g. (65–70%).
A 1-l, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer with a Teflon paddle, gas-inlet tube, thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 216 g. (2.00 moles) of benzyl alcohol and 66 g. (2.20 moles as CH2O) of paraformaldehyde. The resulting mixture is maintained at 20–25° with a water bath during addition of anhydrous hydrogen chloride at a moderate rate, with stirring. After approximately 2 hours the reaction is complete, as judged by the appearance of two clear homogeneous phases. The layers are separated, and the upper layer is diluted with 800 ml. of pentane and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 3 hours at 0°, with stirring. The drying agent is removed by filtration, 2–3 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride is added to the filtrate, and the solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid, which is nearly pure benzyl chloromethyl ether, is decanted, affording 260 g. (83%) of crude product. This crude benzyl chloromethyl ether, which is suitable for use in some applications, is stored over anhydrous calcium chloride at 0° under an inert atmosphere and.
The above process is continued until the distillate no longer separates into two phases (about twenty-seven hours). The liquid in the flask is then distilled with the use of a column until the temperature of the vapor reaches 85°; the residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 106–107°/25 mm. is collected. The yield is 920–960 g. of a colorless liquid (80–83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. trans-1-Amino-2,3-diphenylaziridine. To a magnetically stirred suspension of 20.4 g. (0.0600 mole) of trans-2,3-diphenyl-1-phthalimidoaziridine in 150 ml. of 95% ethanol in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask at room temperature is added 150 ml. (3 moles) of hydrazine hydrate. The mixture is stirred for 40 minutes while maintaining the temperature at 43–45° with a thermostatted oil bath. The resulting cloudy yellow solution is cooled and filtered through Celite®. The filtrate is poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel containing 400 ml. of diethyl ether and 200 g. of ice, and shaken vigorously. The organic phase is separated and washed with three 200-ml. portions of ice-cold water, and the aqueous washings are reextracted with a 250-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered through Celite® if necessary, and concentrated to approximately 300 ml. on a rotary evaporator at room temperature. Addition of 400 ml. of pentane and overnight storage at −20° leads to crystallization of 7.9–9.5 g. (63–75%) of trans-1-amino-2,3-diphenylaziridine as colorless crystals, m.p. 93–94° (dec.). An additional 1.2–2.2 g.. (10–17%) is obtained by concentration of the mother liquor to 50–80 ml. and addition of approximately 50 ml. of pentane.
E. (S)-(−)-1-Carbamoyl-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine. The aqueous amine hydrochloride solution is adjusted to a pH of 2.8–3.2 with aqueous 50% potassium hydroxide. A solution of 80 g (1 mol) of potassium cyanate in 140 mL of water is then added all at once at 15°C and the mixture is allowed to stir for at least 12 hr at 20°C.
To 500 g. (3.85 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate in a 1-l. flask, set in ice and well cooled, are added 152 g. (2 moles) of 40 per cent aqueous formaldehyde solution and 20–25 drops of diethylamine. The flask and contents are kept cold for six hours and are then allowed to stand at room temperature for forty to forty-five hours. At the end of this time two layers are present, a lower oily layer and an upper aqueous layer. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 50 cc. of ether. The ether solution is added to the oily layer, and the resulting solution is dried over 30 g. of calcium chloride. The ether is then removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, amounting to approximately 500 g., is diluted with an equal volume of alcohol and is thoroughly cooled in an ice bath. Ammonia is then passed into the mixture until the solution is saturated. This requires from four to eight hours, and during this time the flask is kept packed in ice. The ammoniacal alcoholic solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for forty to forty-five hours. Most of the alcohol is now evaporated; the residue is cooled, and the solid 1,4-dihydro-3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine is removed from the remaining alcohol on a suction filter. The dried ester melts at 175–180° and weighs 410–435 g. (84–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Ethyl tetrolate. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer and charged with 1000 mL of anhydrous ether. One neck is fitted with a gas inlet joint connected to a nitrogen line equipped with a mineral oil bubbler. The second neck is fitted with a low-temperature thermometer, and the third is closed with a rubber serum cap after nitrogen has been passed through the flask for a few minutes. The flask is then immersed in a dry ice–acetone bath. While the ether is cooling, 85 mL (60.0 g, 1.50 mol) of propyne is condensed into a flask. The stopper is removed briefly, the cold (−78°C) propyne is poured into the flask through a powder funnel inserted into the neck, and stirring is commenced. The stopper is replaced, and 667 mL of a 1.5 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is introduced by syringe at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed −65°C–(Note 6). During the butyllithium addition a copious white precipitate appears. The slurry is stirred at −78°C for 30 min, and 134 mL (152 g, 1.4 mol) of ethyl chloroformate is added. At this point, the acetone–dry ice bath is replaced by an ice bath and the reaction mixture is stirred overnight. During this time the ice bath will melt and the reaction mixture should eventually reach room temperature. The mixture is poured onto 400 g of crushed ice, the layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The ether solutions are combined, washed with brine and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After filtration, the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled at aspirator pressure to obtain 107–108 g (95–97%) of ethyl tetrolate, bp 60–64°C (20 mm) [lit.2 105°C (90 mm)].
One hundred nine grams (1 mole) of p-aminophenol is dissolved in a mixture of 500 g. of ice, 500 cc. of water, and 65 cc. (120 g., 1.2 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). To this solution, kept in a freezing mixture at 0°, is added, during the course of an hour with constant mechanical stirring, a solution of 72 g. (1 mole) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water. The stirring is continued twenty minutes longer, and then 20 cc. (37 g., 0.37 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added.
B. 3,6-Dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid. In a 500-mL flask, the crude ester prepared in Part A (37.00 g, 0.199 mol) is dissolved in a 2 N solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) in methanol (130 mL, 0.260 mol). The solution is stirred at 25°C and disappearance of the starting material is monitored by GLC. After 5 hr saponification is complete and the methanol is evaporated at reduced pressure. The residue is taken up with water (500 mL), extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL), and the organic phase is discarded. The aqueous phase is acidified (pH 2.5 on universal pH indicator paper) with ~6 N hydrochloric acid (about 60 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (5 × 100 mL). These latter ethereal extracts are washed with water (2 × 30 mL) and then with saturated sodium chloride (2 × 30 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Evaporation at reduced pressure affords crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid as a viscous yellow oil that can be used in Part C without further purification. Evacuation at 0.5 mm at room temperature with internal magnetic stirring for 24 hr gives 28.07–29.40 g (82–86% yield) of a solvent-free material and.
The ether layer is decanted into a separatory funnel, and to it is added a 50-cc. ether extract of the pasty residue. The ether is removed by dropping the solution into a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask attached to a condenser and immersed in an oil bath heated to 210–215°. The flask is removed from the oil bath, cooled, and disconnected from the condenser; 100 cc. of 20 per cent sulfuric acid is added. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the contents are boiled for one hour. The aqueous layer is now removed, and the residual oil, without being washed, is distilled at a pressure of about 30 mm. and a bath temperature of about 210°. At first a low-boiling fraction consisting of bromobenzene (12–14 g.) and traces of water distils, after which the diphenylethylene comes over as a colorless liquid, the last portions being slightly yellowish. The brownish residue contains polymerization and decomposition products. On redistillation, the pure hydrocarbon boils at 113°/2 mm.. The yield is 60–66 g. (67–70 per cent of the theoretical amount based on ethyl acetate).
A solution of 390 g. (3 moles) of aniline hydrochloride and 190 g. (3.2 moles) of urea in 1500 cc. of water is boiled in a 3-l. flask under a reflux condenser and. After about one hour, crystals begin to separate; at the end of one and one-half to two hours, the mixture, which bumps considerably, is filtered rapidly by suction, and the crystals of carbanilide washed with 100 cc. of boiling water. The filtrate is chilled, and the phenylurea which crystallizes out is filtered off and rinsed with a little cold water, the washings being discarded. The filtrate is again boiled under a reflux condenser for one and one-half to two hours, or until it begins to bump, and the process is repeated. The above operations are repeated a third time, and each time the phenylurea is collected from the cold filtrate. The mother liquor is finally evaporated to one-half its original volume, and additional crops of carbanilide and phenylurea are so obtained. Further evaporation is not profitable.
A. Nitronium tetrafluoroborate. Caution! Hydrogen fluoride is very hazardous. Caution is also called for in the use of boron trifluoride. All operations must be carried out in a hood, and the precautions outlined in should be followed. A 1-l. three-necked polyolefin flask is provided with a short inlet tube for nitrogen, a long inlet tube for gaseous boron trifluoride, a drying tube, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath and flushed with dry nitrogen. Under a gentle stream of nitrogen and with stirring, the flask is charged with 400 ml. of methylene chloride, 41 ml. (65.5 g., 1.00 mole) of red fuming nitric acid (95%), and 22 ml. (22 g., 1.10 moles) of cold, liquid, anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.
A 250-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask, placed in a room temperature (ca. 20°) water bath, is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a distillation head carrying a thermometer, and connected via an acetone–dry-ice condenser to a receiver cooled to −78° in acetone and dry ice. In the distilling flask are placed 60 g. (0.27 mole) of yellow mercury(II) oxide, 100 ml. of diethyl ether, and 4.5 ml. of a 3 M solution of potassium hydroxide in ethanol. The pressure throughout the system is reduced to 250 mm., and with vigorous stirring 15 g. (0.21 mole) of acetone hydrazone is added dropwise through the funnel. With continued stirring, the pressure is reduced to 15 mm., and ether and 2-diazopropane co-distill and condense in the receiver, yielding 70–90%,, and of product.
The organic solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, giving 4,4'-dimethyl-1,1'-biphenyl contaminated with a small amount of bis(4-methylphenyl)thallium bromide. The crude product is dissolved in 30 ml. of benzene, and the solution is filtered through a short column of alumina using 250 ml. of benzene as eluent. Distillation of the benzene under reduced pressure leaves 19–21 g. (80–83%) of 4,4'-dimethyl-1,1'-biphenyl as a colorless solid, m.p. 118–120°.
If the nitroso derivative is desired, the yellow solid is separated by filtration, washed with water, 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, water, and dried under reduced pressure at room temperature. The solid is recrystallized from ether to give yellow needles of pure nitrosoamide; yield 7.5 g. (64%), m.p. 57–58° (dec.).
Water is distilled from the mixture at atmospheric pressure until the temperature of the solution reaches 115° and, whereupon the liquid is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. This flask is connected to the distillation apparatus used previously except that the thermometer is replaced by a capillary tube. Distillation is then continued under the reduced pressure obtainable from a water aspirator. The bath temperature is raised to 175° over a period of about an hour and is held there until the mixture solidifies (usually 30–60 minutes longer), and for 1 hour thereafter. The flask is cooled and broken to remove the product.
To 500 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84), previously cooled in a freezing mixture, is added, in small portions and with hand stirring, 560 g. of crude guanidine nitrate (obtained from 210 g. of dicyanodiamide as described on p. 302). The temperature is not allowed to rise above 20° during the addition. When all has been added, the milky mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature with occasional stirring until it is homogeneous and free from crystals. It is then poured with stirring into 6 l. of a mixture of cracked ice and water. The precipitated nitroguanidine is filtered, washed free from acid, and recrystallized from the least possible amount (4–5 l.) of boiling water. The yield is 380–390 g. (73–75 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the dicyanodiamide used). The product melts with decomposition at about 232°.
One hundred and sixteen grams (2 moles) of acetone and 510 g. (5 moles) of reagent grade acetic anhydride are placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask and cooled in an ice-salt bath. One neck of the flask is stoppered; the second neck contains a tube for admitting boron trifluoride; and the third neck contains an outlet tube leading to an alkali trap to catch any unabsorbed boron trifluoride. Commercial grade boron trifluoride is passed through a Kjeldahl bulb, to prevent the reaction mixture from sucking back into the cylinder, and is then bubbled into the reaction mixture at such a rate that 500 g. is absorbed in about 5 hours (2 bubbles per second). The reaction mixture is poured into a solution of 800 g. of hydrated sodium acetate in 1.6 l. of water contained in a 5-l. flask. The mixture is then steam-distilled and the distillate collected in the following portions: 1 l., 500 ml., 500 ml., 400 ml.
When the bromine has been added the contents of the flask are transferred directly to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask and the carbon tetrachloride and excess cyclohexene are distilled from a water bath,, and. The water bath is replaced by an oil bath and the product distilled under reduced pressure. There is a small low-boiling fraction, and then pure dibromocyclohexane distils at 99–103°/16 mm. (108–112°/25 mm.). The yield is 303 g. (95 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
D. 3-Benzoylindole. A 100-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 0.48 g. (0.0060 mole) of copper(II) oxide, 1.61 g. (0.0120 mole) of anhydrous copper(II) chloride, and 40 ml. of acetone. The resulting suspension is brought to reflux with vigorous stirring, and a solution of 1.55 g. (0.00508 mole) of 3-(2-phenyl-1,3-dithian-2-yl)-1H-indole in 9 ml. of acetone and 1 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide is added over 5 minutes. Reflux temperatures are maintained for 90 minutes, during which time the reaction mixture gradually turns yellow, then the mixture is cooled and filtered. The insoluble material is washed with three 20-ml. portions of hot 10% ethanol in dichloromethane, and the combined organic solutions are washed with 50 ml. of aqueous 2 N sodium carbonate, dried over sodium sulfate, and filtered. Concentration of the filtrate to a small volume under reduced pressure gives a residue which gradually deposits crystals. Filtration provides 0.94–0.97 g. (85–88%) of pure 3-benzoylindole, m.p. 238–240°.
A. 4-[2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-ethylamino]-3-nitrobenzoic acid ethyl ester (3). A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm).The flask is charged with ethyl-4-chloro-3-nitrobenzoate 1 (5.00 g, 21.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and anhydrous DMSO (20 mL). To this homogeneous yellow mixture, 3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine 2 (4.04 mL, 23.9 mmol, 1.10 equiv) is added dropwise over 1-2 min using a Pasteur pipette. As soon has the first drop is added, the reaction mixture quickly changes to a dark reddish-orange color, but the mixture remains homogeneous throughout the addition without detectable exotherm. N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (5.31 mL, 30.5 mmol, 1.4 equiv) is added dropwise (1-2 min), which results in a slight cloudiness, but no exotherm is detected during or after addition. The flask is closed with a septum and the reaction mixture is stirred in an oil bath heated to 70 °C. During the warming process, the dark reddish-orange color lightens somewhat, but the mixture remains cloudy. The reaction is stirred for 18 h at 70 °C after which time the dark reddish-orange reaction mixture is homogeneous. The reaction is judged to be complete by the disappearance of the starting ester by TLC. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and de-ionized water (2 mL) is added dropwise with a Pasteur pipette over a period of ca. 2-3 min with efficient stirring while a persistent cloudiness develops. Precipitation/crystallization of the product occurs rapidly after the addition, giving rise to a very thick dark-red suspension. After formation of the suspension, water (150 mL) is added in 10 mL portions over a period of ca. 5 min. During the addition of water the mixture becomes slightly warm to the touch. The resulting dark-orange to dark-yellow suspension of product is stirred at room temperature for approximately 1 h. The solids are collected by suction-filtration on filter paper using a ceramic Büchner funnel and the solids are washed with four portions of water (20 - 30 mL each). The solids are allowed to dry for ca. 1-2 h under air suction on the filter funnel. The solids are then collected and placed under vacuum (2 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 7.92-7.98 g (97-98% yield) of a red-orange to dark yellow solid which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.
To the solution of the diazonium salt is now added 848 g. (885 cc., 7 moles) of dimethylaniline; this may be done rapidly, as the temperature does not rise appreciably. Stirring is continued for one hour, the temperature being kept at 5°. Five hundred cubic centimeters of a filtered solution of 680 g. (8.3 moles) of crystallized sodium acetate diluted to 1200 cc. is then added, and the stirring continued for four hours. If a foamy solid rises to the surface during this time and refuses to become incorporated by the stirrer, a few drops of ethyl acetate may be added to reduce the foam. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in an ice bath which is well insulated by several thicknesses of burlap; the temperature must be kept below 7° to get a good yield of product. The remainder of the sodium acetate solution is then added with stirring, and, after the mixture has been stirred for an additional period of one to three hours, the temperature is allowed to rise slowly to 20–25° in the course of twenty-four hours. Just enough sodium hydroxide solution is then added, with stirring, to cause the mixture to have a distinct odor of dimethylaniline (about 240 cc. of a 40 per cent solution is generally required), and the mixture is allowed to stand for forty-eight hours or longer at room temperature (20–25°).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer and thermometer are placed 93 g. (0.5 mole) of dodecanol and 158 g. (2 moles) of pyridine. The flask is surrounded by a water bath sufficiently cold to lower the temperature of the mixture to 10°. At this temperature 105 g. (0.55 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added in portions over a 20- to 30-minute period, or at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 20° at any time. The mixture is then stirred for 3 hours at a temperature below 20°, after which it is diluted with 300 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in 1 l. of ice water. The ester which crystallizes is collected on a chilled Büchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible. The solid is transferred to a 600-ml. beaker, 250–300 ml. of methanol is added, and the mixture is warmed on the steam bath until the ester melts. It is then cooled in a freezing mixture while being stirred continuously; the ester separates in a fairly fine state. It is then collected on a chilled funnel and allowed to dry in the air, preferably at a temperature below 20°. The yield of ester is 152–156 g. (88–90% based upon the dodecanol used). It melts at 20–25° and is sufficiently pure for most purposes.
The separatory funnel is replaced by a wide-bore condenser, and the third neck of the flask is fitted with a stopper. The solution is stirred and portions of 196 g. (3 gram atoms) of zinc dust are added quickly through the third neck of the flask until the liquid boils and then frequently enough to keep it boiling. After the addition has been completed, the mixture is heated by a burner and refluxed for one hour and. While still hot the contents of the flask are decanted from the remaining zinc into a crock containing 10 l. of water which is being vigorously stirred. The zinc residue is washed with two 50-cc. portions of hot glacial acetic acid which are also decanted into the water. After standing overnight, the crude product is filtered by suction, washed on the filter with two 500-cc. portions of water, and dried in air to constant weight. The yield is 205–230 g. (57–64 per cent of the theoretical amount) of material melting at 126–130°. On recrystallizing a 50-g. portion from 100 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and washing twice with 20-cc. portions of cold alcohol, there is obtained 38.5 g. of pale yellow crystals melting at 136–137°.
The residue is diluted with 700 mL of water, and the resulting aqueous solution is washed with three 40-mL portions of dichloromethane, acidified with cold concentrated HCl, and extracted with five 40-mL portions of 1,2-dichloroethane. The combined 1,2-dichloroethane extracts are placed in a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask bearing a reflux condenser; water (50 mL), concentrated HCl (50 mL), and hydroquinone (300 mg) are added; and the mixture is heated at reflux under a positive pressure of nitrogen for 30 min. The mixture is cooled to 25°C, the layers are separated, and the organic layer is washed with 60 mL of 0.5 M aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, concentrated by rotary evaporation at aspirator vacuum, and distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to yield a center cut, bp 100–104°C (0.02 mm), 9.0–11.5 g (46–59%),(Note 6),(Note 7).
(B) Resolution.—A warm solution of 278 g. (1 mole) of sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate and 600 cc. of acetone is treated with 394 g. (1 mole) of brucine and the mixture warmed until the solution is clear. Upon cooling, the crystals of brucine salt (A) form. These are filtered, pressed, and washed in the funnel with 250 cc. of acetone. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to about 50 per cent of their original volume and then poured into dilute hydrochloric acid (slightly more than the calculated amount), which causes the precipitation of the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate. After the precipitate sets to a crystalline mass, it is filtered, washed with cold water, and dried. This weighs approximately one-half of the original ester used and has a rotation [α]5461 − 47° in absolute alcohol solution.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, 50-mL graduated addition funnel, and an argon inlet tube is charged with 10.0 g (0.1019 mol) of 1,3-cyclopentanedione, 55.0 g (0.6106 mol) of 1,3,5-trioxane, 5 g of activated, powered, 4 Å molecular sieves, and 500 mL of freshly distilled dichloromethane. The resultant suspension is stirred at room temperature and 37.6 mL (0.3057 mol) of boron trifluoride etherate is added dropwise over 2 hr via the addition funnel. After 48 hr, the reaction mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite and the yellow solid is washed twice with 100 mL of dichloromethane . The filtrate is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 500 g of ice and 1 L of saturated sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-mL portions of dichloromethane , and the combined organic solutions are washed with 500 mL of brine , dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Flash chromatography on 500 g of silica gel with hexane-acetone (3 : 1) as eluant gives 10.3 g (72% yield) of 2 as a white crystalline solid and.
The flask is reimmersed in the ice bath, and 900–925 g. (5.4–5.5 moles), depending upon the weight of methylamine, of a 60% solution of ethyl acrylate in ethanol is added in portions of about 100 ml. at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture does not rise above 40°; this requires about 10 minutes. After each addition the flask is stoppered to exclude moisture. When all the ester has been added the flask is closed by a rubber stopper and allowed to stand 6 days.
The reaction mixture is cooled to 2-3°C in an ice-water bath, and the resulting solids are collected by vacuum filtration,. The filter cake is thoroughly washed successively with 500 mL of cold deionized water, 2 × 80 mL of absolute ethanol , and 500 mL of cold deionized water affording 88.2 g (98% of theoretical) of moist solid iodinane oxide 1,.
B. 2H-Pyran-2-one. A mixture of 9.81 g. (0.100 mole) of 5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one, 200 mg. of benzoyl peroxide, 18.6 g. (0.105 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide, and 800 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is prepared in a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer. The resulting suspension is stirred and heated to reflux. After 1.5 hours at reflux, most of the solid is dissolved, and the solution gives a negative test with starch–iodide paper. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool, during which time succinimide crystallizes out. The precipitate is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, leaving crude 5-bromo-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one as an oil.
For recrystallization, 5 g. of the crude hemin is placed in a 100-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, 25 ml. of pyridine is added, and the flask is shaken until the hemin has dissolved. Forty milliliters of chloroform is added, and the flask is stoppered with a cork and shaken for 15 minutes; the cork is carefully removed from time to time to release the pressure. The solution is then filtered with slight suction through a small Büchner funnel, and the Erlenmeyer flask and filter are washed with 15 ml. of chloroform.
A 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer through a mercury seal, a reflux condenser and a 1-l. separatory funnel. A mixture of 200 g. (1 mole) of 2,3-dibromopropene (p. 209) and 200 cc. of dry ether is added. The flask is now cooled in an ice bath, the stirrer is started, and one molecular equivalent of cyclohexylmagnesium bromide, prepared from 31 g. (1.28 atoms) of magnesium, 204 g. (1.25 moles) of cyclohexyl bromide, and 400 cc. of dry ether, is added at such a rate that the mixture refluxes gently. The addition takes about one-half to three-quarters of an hour. Two layers are formed, and magnesium bromide may separate.
D. (S)-( + )-2-Methoxymethylpyrrolidine. A solution of 180 g of potassium hydroxide in 720 mL of water is added to the crude product and the mixture is vigorously stirred under argon overnight. Saturation with potassium carbonate (500 g) causes precipitation of potassium salts, which are filtered off by suction (large Büchner funnel) and washed with ether. The filtrate is extracted with ether (3 × 300 mL), and the ether layer is acidified with 100 mL of 12 N hydrochloric acid under ice cooling in a hood (evolution of fumes) and extracted twice with 100 mL of water to yield an aqueous solution of the hydrochloride of 2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine.
A solution of 140 g. (1 mole) of ethyl glycinate hydrochloride2 in 250 ml. of water is mixed with 600 ml. of methylene chloride in a 2-l. four-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, dropping funnel, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet tube, and cooled to −5°. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and an ice-cold solution of 83 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium nitrite in 250 ml. of water is added with stirring. The temperature is lowered to −9°, and 95 g. of 5% (by weight) sulfuric acid is added from the dropping funnel during a period of about 3 minutes. The temperature may rise to a maximum of +1° with the cooling bath at −23°. The reaction terminates within 10 minutes, when heat is no longer evolved.
A mixture of 80 g. (93.2 ml., 1.14 moles) of crotonaldehyde (b.p. 102–103°), 120 g. (1.15 moles) of malonic acid (m.p. 134–135°), and 120 g. (122 ml., 1.52 moles) of pyridine (b.p. 113–115°) is heated for 3 hours in a 1-l. flask on a steam bath under a reflux condenser. At the end of this period the evolution of carbon dioxide will have practically ceased. The flask and contents are then cooled in ice, and a solution of 42.5 ml. (0.76 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 100 ml. of water is added with shaking. Most of the sorbic acid separates at once; the remainder is obtained by chilling the solution in an ice bath for 3 hours. The crude acid is filtered by suction and washed once with a small amount of ice water; it is recrystallized at once from 250 ml. of boiling water. The purified acid, which separates on standing overnight in the ice chest, is filtered; it melts at 134°. The yield is 36–41 g. (28–32%),, and.
During the reaction considerable sodium 2-furancarboxylate separates in fine scale-like crystals. The reaction mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and just enough water is added to dissolve this precipitate. This requires about 325 cc. The solution is then placed in a continuous extraction apparatus (Fig. 16) and the 2-furylcarbinol is extracted with 1500–2000 cc. of ether. The extraction is complete after six to seven hours.
A 250-ml. round-bottomed flask with a side arm is equipped with a distillation head and condenser. The receiving flask is attached to the condenser with an adapter, and the exit from the flask goes to a bubble counter containing high-boiling petroleum ether. A thermometer is inserted in the side arm of the distillation flask, and it reaches to the bottom. With exclusion of moisture, 147 g. (0.704 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride and 100 g. (0.704 mole) of p-chloroanisole are added to the flask. The flask is heated in an oil bath; the reaction begins when the inside temperature reaches 120° and occurs rapidly at 140°. The temperature is raised to 160° over a period of 2 hours, thereby distilling the phosphorus trichloride. After the gas evolution subsides, the reaction mixture is heated to 175° for a short time. About 73–75 g. of phosphorus trichloride is collected.
C. (+)-[(7,7-Dichlorocamphoryl)sulfonyl]imine. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer or magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, and 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a nitrogen inlet, is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with a solution of 50 g (0.235 mol) of (−)-(camphorsulfonyl)imine in 250 mL of ethyl acetate. To this solution is added 71 g (0.47 mol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) over 30 min, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min at room temperature. To the resulting mixture is then added 51.5 g (0.26 mol) of 1,3-dichloro-5,5-dimethylhydantoin in portions over 90 min while maintaining the reaction temperature at 20–25°C by cooling with an ice-water bath. When the reaction is complete, typically 30–60 min as determined by HPLC or TLC and, 400 mL of water is slowly added while keeping the temperature at 20–25°C. The pH of the reaction mixture is adjusted to 7–7.5 by the addition of ~25 mL of concd hydrochloric acid, and the ethyl acetate solvent is removed on the rotary evaporator at a maximum bath temperature of 60°C. The resulting suspension is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, then the solids are collected by suction filtration, washed with 500 mL of water, and dried in a draft oven at 50°C to a constant weight affording 62.0–63.0 g (94–95%) of white solid (+)-(7,7-dichlorocamphorylsulfonyl)imine (mp 170–175°C) and. This product is suitable for further reaction without purification.
The beaker is chilled in an ice bath for 1 hour. The crystalline diacetate that separates is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with three 20-ml. portions of cold water. After drying for 30 minutes on the funnel with suction, the diacetate is dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator containing calcium chloride. The dried diacetate weighs 26.7–29.3 g. (83–91%) and melts at 158–159° with decomposition. The purity of the diacetate, determined by the titration method of Lucas, Kennedy, and Formo,3 is 97–98%, which is good enough for most purposes. The purity can be increased to 99–100% by a recrystallization from 5M acetic acid.
The water is removed from the water bath and replaced by an ice-salt mixture. A thermometer is placed in the flask with the bulb below the surface of the liquid, and the mixture is cooled below 0°. Then a solution of about 27 g. (0.75 mole) of hydrogen chloride in 200 ml. of absolute ethanol is slowly added during about 40 minutes with stirring and cooling at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10°. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature, and the stirring is continued for 3 hours. It is then allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is again cooled to 0°, and the excess acid is neutralized to approximately pH 7 by slowly adding sodium ethoxide solution. The mixture is tested from time to time during the addition of the alkali by placing a drop on moistened pH test paper. About 75 ml. of sodium ethoxide solution is required. The mixture is then filtered through a large Büchner funnel, and the precipitate is extracted thoroughly with ether which is added to the alcoholic filtrate. The solid is discarded.
A solution of 52 g. of the crude phenanthrene in 400 ml. of diethylene glycol is azeotropically distilled through a small column. A fore-run of approximately 50 g. is collected at 155–165°/100 mm., followed by the main fraction of 390–400 g., b.p. 140–141°/21 mm.. The fore-run contains considerable fluorene and should be discarded. The main fraction is added to five times its volume of water, and the precipitated hydrocarbon is collected by suction filtration and washed well with water to remove the last traces of diethylene glycol. The colorless product (41–43 g.) is heated under reflux for 3 hours with about 450 ml. of 95% ethanol containing approximately 9 g. of Raney nickel catalyst. The hot solution is filtered with slight suction through a sintered-glass funnel. On being concentrated to about 250 ml. and cooled, the filtrate deposits 33–35 g. (63–67%) of colorless phenanthrene, m.p. 97.5–98°.
The addition funnel is charged with 9.53 mL (9.46 g, 98.4 mmol) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one. After addition of approximately 2 mL of the enone, the flask is quickly immersed in an ice bath and the remainder of the enone is added dropwise to the cooled, stirred, dark-brown solution over a 10-min period. At the completion of the addition, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred an additional 2.5 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and the round-bottomed flask is washed with two 200-mL portions of diethyl ether that are added to the separatory funnel. The mixture is washed successively with two 150-mL portions of 2N hydrochloric acid to remove pyridine, three 150-mL portions of aqueous 20% sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) and 100 mL of brine . The resulting organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , filtered, and evaporated at reduced pressure to give a yellow-orange solid.
A 1-l., round-bottomed flask is charged with 72 g. of the crude oxazolidine in 600 ml. of water, and 201.6 g. (1.6 moles) of hydrated oxalic acid is added. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour, cooled, treated with 600 ml. of water to dissolve precipitated oxalic acid, and extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with 50 ml. saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and concentrated, giving 30–35 g. of crude aldehyde. Distillation of this material at 70–75° (1.5 mm.) gives pure o-anisaldehyde (22.8–26.3 g.; 51–59%), m.p. 35.5–38°.
The dried solution is then fractionally distilled in a modified 100-cc. Claisen flask (p. 130). The chloroform is removed by distilling at ordinary pressure until the temperature reaches 120°. The remainder may be fractionated under ordinary pressure but it is better to use reduced pressure. After two or three distillations the yield of pure product boiling at 93–96°/26 mm. and is 42–49 g. (60–70 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chlorobromide used, or 40–47 per cent based on the total amount of chlorobromide taken) and.
Chlorine is again introduced, and the stirred reaction mixture is cooled to maintain the temperature initially in the vicinity of 40°. During 3 hours the temperature slowly returns to that of the surroundings, and the stream of chlorine is stopped. The yellow solution is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and is then transferred to a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and diluted with 1.5 l. of ice water. The flask is stoppered and placed in a refrigerator for 2–3 hours. The aqueous phase is decanted from the denser, organic layer that has separated and is extracted with four 300-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride extracts are combined with the original organic layer, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated on a rotary evaporator at 20–30°. The material that remains is distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column. Chloromethanesulfonyl chloride is collected as a colorless, lachrymatory liquid, b.p. 80–81° (25 mm.), n26D 1.4840–1.4850; yield 135–220 g. (20–32%).
B. 3-Chlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a 500-ml., stoppered, pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with 350 ml. of dry ether and 15 g. (0.40 mole) of powdered lithium aluminum hydride. The flask is placed in a mixture of ice and water, and 1050 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added. Stirring is begun, and a solution of 39.5 g. (0.224 mole) of exo-3,4-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene in 50 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise from the addition funnel over a 30-minute period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated under gentle reflux for 18 hours. The mixture is cooled to 0°, and the remaining lithium aluminum hydride is decomposed by the careful addition of wet ether, followed by the cautious dropwise addition of 10 ml. of water. The resulting mixture is poured onto 500 g. of crushed ice in 200 ml. of water. After the ice has melted, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is acidified to a pH of 5–6 with 10% hydrochloric acid, dissolving the lithium and aluminum salts present. The aqueous solution is shaken five times with 200-ml. portions of ether. The organic layers are combined, washed with 200 ml. of a saturated solution of sodium chloride, and dried overnight over 20 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether and tetrahydrofuran are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the product is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 23.5–23.9 g. (74–75%) of 3-chlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene as a colorless oil, b.p. 76–77° (21 mm.), nD20 1.5072.
B. Ferrocenecarboxylic acid. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser topped with a nitrogen-inlet tube is charged with 250 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 46.0 g. (0.411 mole) of potassium tert-butoxide. A nitrogen atmosphere is established in the system, and 2.2 ml. (0.12 mole) of water is added with stirring, producing a slurry, to which the crude (2-chlorobenzoyl)ferrocene is added. The red solution is stirred and refluxed under nitrogen. As the reaction proceeds the color fades to tan, and after 1 hour at reflux the reaction mixture is cooled and poured into 1 l. of water. The resulting solution is washed with three 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether, which are combined and back-extracted with two 50-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide. The aqueous phases are then combined and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is collected by filtration and air dried, yielding 17.0–19.2 g. (74–83% from ferrocene) of ferrocenecarboxylic acid as an air-stable yellow powder, m.p. 214–216° (dec.,).
This 3 l. of distillate is then mixed with the first yield of quinoline, and 280 g. (150 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added. The solution is cooled to 0–5°, and a saturated solution of sodium nitrite added until a distinct excess of nitrous acid is present (as shown either by starch-potassium iodide paper or by the odor). This generally requires 50 to 70 g. of sodium nitrite. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath for one hour, or until active evolution of gas ceases, and is then distilled with steam until all the volatile material has been expelled (4 l. of distillate will result). The receiver is then changed and the mixture in the distillation flask is neutralized, as before, with 700 g. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The quinoline is distilled exactly as described above, the aqueous portions of the distillate being distilled with steam until all the quinoline has been isolated. The crude product is then distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction which boils at 110–114°/14 mm. is collected. The forerun is separated from any water which may be present, dried with a little solid alkali, and redistilled. The total yield is 255–275 g. (84–91 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the aniline taken).
Ten grams (0.075 mole) of phthalide, 13.3 g. (0.075 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide, and 200 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride are refluxed for 30 minutes in a 500-ml. flask carrying a reflux condenser equipped with a drying tube containing Drierite. The reaction mixture is exposed to the light of an ordinary 100-watt unfrosted light bulb placed 6–8 in. from the flask. The end of the reaction is indicated by the disappearance of N-bromosuccinimide from the bottom of the flask and accumulation of succinimide at the top of the reaction mixture. The succinimide is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated under atmospheric pressure to 15–20 ml. Cooling of this concentrate followed by filtration gives 12–13 g. (75–81%) of crude 3-bromophthalide, m.p. 74–80°. The crude material, when recrystallized from cyclohexane, gives colorless plates, m.p. 78–80°,(Note 3),(Note 4).
There is obtained 257–265 g. (88–91%) of p-toluenesulfonylanthranilic acid as a pale lavender powder with a neutral equivalent of 294–300, which indicates a purity of 97–99%. This product is suitable for conversion to 2-aminobenzophenone, but it may be recrystallized by dissolving in hot 95% ethanol (10 ml. per g.) and then adding water (4 ml. per g.). The recovery in the first crop is about 75% of material melting at 229–230° and having a neutral equivalent of 295.
A. 1-(2-Benzoylpropanoyl)piperidine. A dry, 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with nitrogen. One neck is connected to a three-way stopcock equipped with a balloon filled with nitrogen, and the other neck is capped with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THE) and 10.1 g (14.1 mL, 0.100 mol) of diisopropylamine and immersed in an acetone–dry ice bath. A 1.68 M hexane solution of butyllithium (60 mL, 0.10 mol) is added dropwise with stirring over a 10-min period, and the stirring is continued for 1 hr at −78°C. To the resulting lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution is added dropwise 14.1 g (0.100 mol) of propanoylpiperidine with stirring over a 10-min period, and the stirring is continued for 2 hr at −78°C. The rubber septum is replaced with a polyvinyl chloride (or Teflon) tube connected to another 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, which is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a three-way stopcock, charged with 100 mL of anhydrous THF and 13.5 g (16.3 mL, 0.110 mol) of benzoyl chloride, and immersed in an acetone–dry ice bath. The balloon is taken off and nitrogen is passed through the two stopcocks so that the reaction mixture does not come in contact with air (see the apparatus shown in Fig. 1). By inclining the first flask, the THF solution of the lithium enolate of 1-propanoylpiperidine is added to the THF solution of benzoyl chloride in the second flask through the polyvinyl chloride tube over a 5-min period. After the solution is stirred for 0.5 hr at −78°C, it is allowed to warm to room temperature, diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane, and washed with 200 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Recrystallization from diethyl ether–hexane affords 12.5 g (51%) of 1-(2-benzoylpropanoyl)piperidine, mp 100–101°C.
A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a condenser protected by a drying tube, a thermometer, and an inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask. A solution of 25.6 g. (0.2 mole) of recrystallized tetracyanoethylene (p. 877) in 300 ml. of acetone is placed in the flask, and 300 ml. of carbon disulfide is added. The flask and its contents are cooled to 0° by means of a salt-ice bath. With good stirring, hydrogen sulfide is passed into the reaction mixture at a moderate rate while the temperature is maintained at 0–5°. The solution becomes milky after a few minutes owing to the formation of colloidal sulfur. The hydrogen sulfide addition is continued for about 30 minutes, or until the solution is thoroughly saturated.
On redistillation under reduced pressure a fraction boiling over a range of not more than 2° (e.g., 137–139°/10 mm.) is obtained with very little loss; this fraction solidifies almost completely at 30°. The yield is 72–76 g. (21–22 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. α,α-Dimethyl-β-phenethylamine. In a 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a sealed stirrer are placed 246 g. (1.39 moles) of N-formyl-α,α-dimethyl-β-phenethylamine and 2.1 l. of 20% sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated under reflux with vigorous stirring for 2.5 hours or until a test portion of the oily layer dissolves completely in cold 5% hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture is cooled, 750 ml. of benzene is added, the mixture is stirred, and the benzene layer is separated. The benzene solution is shaken with a saturated sodium chloride solution, the benzene removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the product distilled at reduced pressure to yield 155–165 g. (75–80%) of α,α-dimethyl-β-phenethylamine, b.p. 80–82° (10 mm.).
A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser is charged with 2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol 1,4-bismethanesulfonate (40 g, 0.126 mol), 95% ethanol (250 mL) and methanesulfonic acid (0.204 mL, 3.14 mmol), and brought to a gentle reflux. The solution is refluxed for 10 hr and then cooled to 0°C with an ice-water bath resulting in the formation of crystals. The crystals are collected by suction filtration, washed with cold ethanol (2 × 50 mL) and diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL), and dried in a vacuum desiccator at 60°C under full vacuum for 4 hr to give the product as white crystals, mp 101-102°C, 29.6 g, (84% yield).
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing separatory funnel, are placed 48 g. (2 g. atoms) of magnesium turnings, 500 ml. of anhydrous ether, and a small crystal of iodine. The cold methyl bromide solution is transferred to the separatory funnel and slowly added, with stirring. The reaction starts spontaneously, and the remainder of the methyl bromide is added at a rate such that the solution boils gently under reflux. Generally, the addition is complete at the end of 1–2 hours and all the magnesium should be dissolved. After the stirred solution of methylmagnesium bromide is well cooled by using an ice bath, a solution of 78.0 g. (0.5 mole) of γ-nonanoic lactone in 100 ml. of dry ether is added slowly over a period of 30 minutes. When the addition is complete, the mixture is placed on a steam bath and boiled under reflux for 2 hours. Then the condenser is arranged for downward distillation, and the ether is removed.
B. O-Allyl-N-(9-Anthracenylmethyl)cinchonidinium bromide. A 1-L, three-necked flask, equipped with an overhead stirrer and nitrogen inlet, is charged with 49.5 g (80.7 mmol) of N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)cinchonidinium chloride-toluene solvate, 400 mL of methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), 25 mL of allyl bromide (35.0 g, 289 mmol) and 50 mL of 50% aqueous potassium hydroxide. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 4 hr, then diluted with 400 mL of water and stirred for 5 min. After separation of the phases, the organic phase is washed with a solution of 25 g of sodium bromide in 250 mL of water and dried over 50 g of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). The solution is filtered using 50 mL of CH2Cl2 as a rinse, and 275 mL of ethyl ether is added over 15 min producing a heavy crystalline mass. After stirring for 1 hr, the solids are collected by filtration, washed with 250 mL of 1:4 methylene chloride:ethyl ether and dried at 50°C under vacuum for 1 hr to afford 38.1 g (62.9 mmol, 78%) of O-allyl-N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)cinchonidinium bromide as a crystalline yellow solid.
The 1-methyl-2-pyridone is salted out of the reaction mixture by the addition of 400–500 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate to the well-stirred solution. When no more sodium carbonate dissolves, stirring is discontinued and the yellow or brown oily layer containing most of the desired pyridone, together with some of the unreacted pyridinium salt, water, and inorganic salts, is separated from the aqueous mixture. The aqueous mixture is filtered to remove the excess sodium carbonate and the precipitated potassium or sodium ferrocyanide. The filtrate is divided into three portions, each of which is extracted twice with 200-cc. portions of technical isoamyl alcohol. The alcohol used for the second extraction of the first aqueous portion is satisfactory for the first extraction of a second aqueous portion, et cetera, so that a total volume of 800 cc. is used. The isoamyl alcohol extracts are combined and added to the oily layer which was first separated from the reaction mixture. An aqueous layer usually appears and is separated and extracted with another 100-cc. portion of amyl alcohol.
A. 1,2-Cyclohexanedione. A 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with stirrer and dropping funnel, is placed in a water bath containing a copper coil through which cooling water may be circulated. In the 3-l. flask is placed 1708 g. (17.4 moles, 1.8 l.) of cyclohexanone. Tap water is circulated through the cooling coil, and a solution containing 387 g. (3 moles) of selenious acid (H2SeO3), 500 ml. of dioxane, and 100 ml. of water is added dropwise and with stirring to the cyclohexanone over a period of 3 hours. The reaction mixture immediately turns yellow, and red amorphous selenium gradually appears. Stirring is continued for 5 additional hours at water-bath temperatures and then for 6 more hours at room temperature. Removal of the bulky, amorphous selenium is accomplished with the aid of a 6-in. Büchner funnel. The selenium is returned to the reaction flask and extracted with 300 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol for 1 hour. The solution, obtained by decantation from the compact gray selenium, is combined with the above filtrate in a 4-l. distilling flask. Distillation under reduced pressure gives two fractions. The lower-boiling fraction (25–60°/16 mm.) consists mainly of ethanol, water, dioxane, and cyclohexanone; the higher-boiling one (60–90°/16 mm.) contains cyclohexanone and 1,2-cyclohexanedione with traces of water and dioxane. The yield of crude product is approximately 322 g.
A. Ethyl 3-iodopropionate . A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser is charged with ethyl 3-chloropropionate (27.3 g, 0.2 mol) and acetone (400 mL). Sodium iodide (300 g, 2 mol) is added to the clear solution and the mixture is refluxed for 16 hr. The resulting pale yellow reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, the stirring bar and reflux condenser are removed and the acetone is removed on a rotary evaporator at 40°C/550 mbar (412 mm). The residue is taken up in diethyl ether (300 mL) and washed with a saturated aqueous solution of sodium thiosulfate (3 × 100 mL). The ethereal phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , filtered and the ether is removed by rotary evaporation at 40°C. The resulting yellow oil is purified by distillation with a membrane pump 90°C/25 mbar (18.7 mm) yielding 36.8 g of ethyl 3-iodopropionate as a clear oil (82%).
The crude benzil is dissolved in 500 ml. of chloroform. To remove the impurity that remains, the solution is shaken with three 400-ml. portions of 6% aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution containing 1.0 g. of sodium hydroxide in each portion, and finally with 500 ml. of water. The aqueous layers are combined, warmed to drive off dissolved chloroform, and filtered to separate about 1.5 g. of a yellow-green solid, which is dissolved in the chloroform solution.
B. Ethyl 1-(p-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate. A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 22.2 g (45 mmol) of p-methoxyphenyllead triacetate, 10.8 g (135 mmol) of pyridine, and 70 mL of chloroform. To this solution is added 7.0 g (41 mmol) of ethyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate, a calcium chloride drying tube is put in place, and the mixture is stirred at 40°C.
If further purification is desired, the crude product is added to 1 l. of methanol in a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 30 minutes. A 10-g. portion of activated carbon is added, and after 5 minutes the hot mixture is filtered. The light yellow-red filtrate is concentrated to a volume of 50 ml. under reduced pressure and cooled to 0°. The resulting orange crystals are filtered, washed with two 25-ml. portions of acetone, and dried for 1 hour at 50° (1 mm.), affording 24–27 g. (50–58%) of glutaconaldehyde sodium salt dihydrate and.
The reaction mixture is filtered with suction and the cake is washed thoroughly with two 200-ml. portions of glacial acetic acid. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated under reduced pressure on the steam bath until a thick oil, which generally partially crystallizes, remains. To purify the crude product, 100 ml. of water is added, and the flask is warmed on a steam bath until the solid melts. The mixture of water and oil is stirred rapidly in an ice bath, and diethyl acetamidomalonate crystallizes as a fine white product. After cooling in an ice bath for an additional hour, the product is collected by filtration, washed once with cold water, and dried in air at 50°. A second crop is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor under reduced pressure. The yield of diethyl acetamidomalonate, m.p. 95–97°, is 52–53 g. (77–78%) based on malonic ester.
C. dl-Isoleucine. One hundred and fifty grams (0.77 mole) of α-bromo-β-methylvaleric acid is added to 645 ml. of technical ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) in a 1.5-l. round-bottomed flask. A stopper is wired in, and the flask is allowed to stand at room temperature for a week. The stopper is removed and the mixture heated on a steam cone overnight to remove ammonia. The aqueous solution is concentrated under reduced pressure until bumping becomes violent (about 300 ml.). The mixture is then cooled to 15° and the crystals are collected on a filter. The crystals are washed with 40 ml. of ethanol and dried. The filtrate is again concentrated to about 150 ml., and a second crop of crystals is obtained. This second crop is washed with 25 ml. of water and then with 25 ml. of 95% ethanol. The yield of crude product is 65 g.
(A) Ester Condensation.—In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser equipped with a dropping funnel and a calcium chloride tube, is placed a suspension of 6.1 g. (0.27 mole) of powdered sodium in 150 cc. of absolute ether. A solution of 12.6 g. (0.27 mole) of absolute ethyl alcohol and 50 cc. of absolute ether is added, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight to complete the reaction. To the suspension of sodium ethoxide, 57 g. (0.39 mole) of ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261), diluted with 50 cc. of ether, is added in portions. After the spontaneous reaction subsides, the pale yellow solution is allowed to stand for one-half hour, and 50 g. (0.26 mole) of ethyl γ-phenylbutyrate, diluted with 50 cc. of absolute ether is added. The mixture is refluxed gently for twenty-four hours.
(A) 2,6-Dibromo-4-aminophenol Chlorostannate.—In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 148.5 g. (0.5 mole) of 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol (p. 173) with 300 cc. (3.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19), 300 cc. of water, and 185 g. (1.56 gram atoms) of mossy tin. Three cubic centimeters of capryl alcohol is added to control the foaming, and the mixture is heated in the open flask with stirring on the steam bath until the reaction starts. The reaction may proceed vigorously at the outset, and it is well to heat cautiously during the initial stages. Hydrochloric acid and water are added from time to time, and foaming can be controlled by the addition of a part of the water. A total of 520 cc. (6.4 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 900 cc. of water are added during the course of the reaction. When the first, vigorous reaction is over the mixture is heated strongly until all the dibromonitrophenol has dissolved, and the hot solution (at about 85°) is filtered through a layer of Norite on a hot Büchner funnel. The filtrate, which usually is colorless, is cooled to 0° with stirring for two hours, or allowed to stand in a cool place overnight. The product, which separates in the form of colorless or slightly yellow needles, is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with cold dilute hydrochloric acid (one volume of concentrated acid to one volume of water). The material is usually colorless and may be used directly for the reaction which follows. After drying in an oven at 50–60°, or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide, the tin salt weights 214–220 g. The theoretical weight, based on the formula assumed above, is 217 g.
A. Spiro[4.5]decane-1,4-dione (2). In a dry, 200-mL, two-necked flask with one neck connected to a nitrogen source to maintain a positive pressure and the other neck covered with a rubber septum is placed a magnetic stirring bar. Boron trifluoride etherate (5.04 mL, 40.0 mmol) and 40 mL of dry methylene chloride are introduced with a hypodermic syringe and the solution is cooled to ca. −75°C with a dry ice/hexane bath. A mixture of cyclohexanone diethyl ketal (6.88 g, 40 mmol) and 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclobut-1-ene (9.20 g, 40 mmol) in 20 mL of dry methylene chloride is added during 10 min. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for 30 min at that temperature and 8 mL of trifluoracetic acid is added. The mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 2 hr before addition of 40 mL of water. The mixture is extracted 3 times with 100 mL-portions of ether, and the combined extract is washed successively with a 30-mL portion of water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 × 45 mL), and 30 mL of saturated sodium chloride. The extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at aspirator pressure. The crude, viscous oily material is distilled at 0.05 mm with a Kugelrohr apparatus with an oven temperature at 75–80°C to obtain 5.40–6.00 g (81–90%) of spiro[4.5]decane-1,4-dione, which crystallizes on cooling to room temperature, mp 61–62°C.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, are mixed 750 g. (918 cc.) of 95 per cent alcohol, 750 g. (408 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid and 450 g. (3.85 moles) of benzyl cyanide. The mixture, which soon separates into two layers, is heated to boiling over a low flame, for six to seven hours, cooled, and poured into 2 l. of water, and the upper layer is separated. This is washed with a little 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution to remove small amounts of phenylacetic acid which may have been formed, and then distilled under reduced pressure. A small amount of water goes over first and then a pure product boiling 132–138°/32 mm. (120–125°/17–18 mm.). The yield is 525–550 g. (83–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
When all the acid has been added, the mixture is heated for one-half hour on the water bath and then distilled directly from an oil bath into a second distilling flask. The crude acid chloride thus obtained boils between 70° and 110°; it is purified by distillation through a column and boils almost entirely at 100–101°, only a few drops of forerun being obtained. The yield is 36 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a dry 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a 500-cc. dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser to the upper end of which a calcium chloride tube is attached, is placed 26.7 g. (1.1 atoms) of magnesium turnings. The reaction requires 450 cc. of ether and 118.5 g. (121 cc., 1 mole) of cyclohexyl chloride. About 100 cc. of the ether, 15 cc. of the pure halide, and a crystal of iodine are added to the magnesium. Heat is applied, without stirring, for five to ten minutes after the iodine color has disappeared. When reaction has set in, sufficient ether is added to cover the magnesium while it is stirred, and the remainder of the halide in ether is added in one-half to three-quarters of an hour, the flask being cooled with ice water if necessary. When all the halide has been added, stirring and refluxing are continued fifteen to twenty minutes.
A solution of 15 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 30 ml. of water is deoxygenated as described above and slowly injected with a syringe into the reaction. Refluxing is continued for 6 hours, the flask is cooled, and its contents are poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel along with 200 ml. of water. The solution is extracted four times with 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed successively with 100 ml. of 6 N hydrochloric acid, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of brine. The organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and distilled, yielding 13.2–13.8 g. (65–67%) of 1-methyl-4,4a,5,6,7,8-hexahydronaphthalen-2(3H)-one, b.p. 85–90° (0.5 mm.); nD23 1.5120; IR: 1670, 1605 cm.−1; 1H NMR (CCl4): δ 1.0–2.5 (m, 13H, 6CH2 and CH), 1.7 (s, 3H, C=CCH3).
The filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, immersed in an ice-salt mixture and equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The solution is diluted with 2.3 l. of ice water; then an ice-cold solution of 290 g. (4.2 moles) of sodium nitrite in 750 ml. of water is added dropwise during a period of about 1 hour with stirring and cooling (ice-salt bath) to maintain the temperature at −5°. The mixture is stirred for an additional period of 1 hour and then allowed to come to room temperature overnight as the ice in the cooling bath melts. The acetic acid in the reaction mixture is neutralized by the addition of small portions of solid sodium bicarbonate, and the neutral (to litmus paper) solution is then steam-distilled until about 2 l. of distillate is collected. The oily cycloheptanone layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried briefly over magnesium sulfate. Most of the ether is removed by distillation through a 17 by 2.5 cm. glass helix-packed column at atmospheric pressure. The residue is then distilled through the same column, and the fraction boiling at 80–85°/30 mm. is collected. The yield of cycloheptanone is 112–118 g. (40–42%), n25D 1.4600 and.
In a 1-l. separatory funnel is placed a solution of 39.2 g. (0.2 mole) of trans-stilbene oxide in 450 ml. of reagent benzene. To the solution is added 13.2 ml. (0.1 mole) of boron trifluoride etherate. The solution is swirled, allowed to stand for 1 minute, and then washed with two 300-ml. portions of water. The organic layer is separated, and the benzene is removed by distillation. The residual crude aldehyde is purified by distillation under reduced pressure. The product, collected at 115–117°/0.6 mm., amounts to 29–32 g. (74–82%), nD25 1.5875–1.5877.
A. cis-1,2-Cyclohexanedimethanol. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, and condenser is charged with 1.5 l. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. With vigorous stirring, 14.8 g. (0.389 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride is added, followed by a solution of 50.0 g. (0.325 mole) of cis-1,2-cyclohexanedicarboxylic anhydride in 300 ml. of tetrahydrofuran introduced in a thin stream over 30 minutes. The resulting suspension is maintained at the reflux temperature for 3 hours with a heating mantle, after which heating is ceased and 100 ml. of a freshly prepared, saturated aqueous sodium sulfate is cautiously added dropwise. Highly granular insoluble salts, which change in appearance from gray to white, are removed by suction filtration through a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with diethyl ether. The combined filtrates are freed of solvent on a rotary evaporator, yielding 46.0–46.5 g. (98–100%) of the diol as a colorless, viscous oil which may slowly crystallize, m.p. 38–40°. Pure cis-1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol is reported to have m.p. 42–43°.3,4,5
The flask is then cooled in ice water, and the contents are filtered with as little suction as possible. The filter cake is pressed dry and washed with three 15-ml. portions of tetrachloroethane first used to rinse out the flask. The combined filtrates are dried with a little calcium chloride. Sometimes the solution contains a little bromine; it is removed by adding allyl alcohol dropwise until the bromine color is discharged (usually 0.5–1.0 ml. suffices).
To 200 g. (0.79 mole) of the ester in a 5-l. flask is added a mixture of 270 g. of water, 72 g. of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42), and 78 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is then very cautiously heated, and the contents are kept in a swirling motion by a slow shaking of the flask by hand. The oxidation is accompanied by considerable foaming if the heating is too rapid, part of the reaction mixture may be lost by excessive frothing. After the foaming has subsided, the reaction mixture is again warmed cautiously until the liquid assumes a deep red color. The entire oxidation is carried out in ten to fifteen minutes. After the liquid has ceased boiling, it is treated with 500 cc. of water and 500 g. of finely chopped ice. The resulting solution is made strongly alkaline by the gradual addition of ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90). The precipitated 3,5-dicarbethoxy-2,6-dimethylpyridine is filtered with suction, dried on a porous plate, and then distilled. The yield of product boiling at 170–172°/8 mm. is 115–130 g. (58–65 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the dihydro ester).
C. (Z)-4-(2-Propenyl)-3-octen-1-ol . The solution of lithium dibutylcuprate is cooled to −80°C and transferred by cannula under nitrogen pressure over 10 min to the stirred suspension of 2,3-dihydro-5-furyllithium cooled to −85°C. After the transfer, the flask containing the cuprate is washed with 5 mL of diethyl ether . The temperature of the light brown suspension is allowed to rise slowly to 0°C over 3 hr and stirred at 0-3°C for 30 min. The brown solution is cooled to −80°C and a solution of allyl bromide (17.9 g, 12.8 mL, 148 mmol) in diethyl ether (20 mL) is added dropwise during 10 min via syringe. The black mixture is left in the cooling bath to warm gradually to rt overnight (12 hr). The resultant dark gray suspension is treated with an aqueous saturated solution of ammonium chloride (50 mL) and aqueous ammonia (20 mL, 30% in water). The organic layer is separated and the water layer extracted with ether (2 × 75 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried with sodium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a cold water bath (10-20°C). The crude product (light brown oil) is purified by flash chromatography on silica (150 g) eluting first with hexanes-diethyl ether (5:1, 500 mL followed by 1:2, 700 mL). The residue obtained from evaporation of the second fraction is distilled using a Kugelrohr oven to give the product as a colorless oil (6.39 g, 84%), bp 150°C (bath)/0.01 mm).
B. Two hundred grams of benzoic acid (1.6 moles) is stirred into 1 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid contained in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is surrounded by cold water, and the temperature is maintained below 45° while 80 ml. of fuming nitric acid is added. When the temperature of the reaction mixture has fallen to 30°, 240 ml. of fuming nitric acid is added, a beaker is inverted over the neck of the flask, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 6 weeks.
In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask provided with a Hershberg stirrer and a thermometer are placed 1.25 l. of reagent-grade benzene and 325 g. (1.24 moles) of di-n-butyl d-tartrate. The mixture is stirred rapidly, and 578 g. (1.30 moles) of lead tetraacetate is added over a period of about 25 minutes. The temperature is maintained below 30° by occasional cooling with cold water. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour, during which time the gummy salts become crystalline. The salts are removed by filtration with suction and washed with 500 ml. of benzene. The benzene and acetic acid are removed from the filtrate by distillation at 65°/50 mm. The residue is distilled at 20 mm. under nitrogen introduced through an ebullator, using a Vigreux column (2 by 30 cm.), and the fraction boiling between 65° and 79°/20 mm. (main portion at 68–74°) is collected as product. The crude n-butyl glyoxylate, which weighs 247–280 g. (77–87%), n20D 1.442–1.443, d254 1.085, is satisfactory for most purposes.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser are placed 168 g. (2 moles) of thiophene and 107 g. (1 mole) of 95% acetic anhydride. The solution is heated to 70–75°, the source of heat is removed, and 10 g. (6 ml.) of 85% phosphoric acid is added with stirring. After 2–3 minutes an exothermic reaction occurs, and it is necessary to immerse the flask in a cold water bath to control the reaction. The boiling subsides in a few minutes; heat is again applied, and the mixture is refluxed for a total of 2 hours. The cooled mixture is washed successively with one 250-ml. portion of water and two 100-ml. portions of 5% sodium carbonate and is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The orange-red liquid is distilled through a short fractionating column. After the removal of 76–80 g. of unchanged thiophene (b.p. 83–84°) by distillation at atmospheric pressure the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of 2-acetothienone, b.p. 89–90°/10 mm. (m.p. 9.2–10.5°; n20D1.5662), is 93–100 g. (74–79%).
The solvent is removed at a maximum water-bath temperature of 60° and a minimum pressure of 30 mm.. The residual liquid is distilled through a 25-cm. Vigreux column, and the fraction boiling at 74–76/8 mm. is collected. The yield of 2-oxa-7,7-dichloronorcarane is 91–100 g. (68–75%), nD25 1.4974–1.4983.
B. Ethyl isocrotonate. An oven-dried, 500-mL hydrogenation flask equipped with a sidearm fitted with a rubber serum cap and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 0.4 g of 5% palladium on barium sulfate, 0.4 g of quinoline, and 200 mL of anhydrous ether. The flask is attached to an atmospheric-pressure hydrogenation apparatus and flushed with hydrogen. Ethyl tetrolate (23.2 mL, 22.4 g, 0.2 mol) is introduced into the hydrogenation flask with a syringe, and stirring is commenced. The progress of the reaction may be monitored by the uptake of hydrogen (theoretical ≅ 4500 mL), by gas chromatography, or by removing aliquots that are concentrated and analyzed by 1H NMR, monitoring the disappearance of the methyl singlet at δ 1.95; a total hydrogenation time of 10–15 hr is required. After hydrogenation is complete, the catalyst is removed by filtration of the reaction mixture through a Celite pad. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator to obtain 21.1–22.4 g (93–98%) of ethyl isocrotonate as a light-yellow liquid. This material contains traces of quinoline but is of a purity suitable for many uses and. The quinoline may be removed, if desired, by washing the ether solution with 1 M aqueous acetic acid, followed by aqueous sodium carbonate, or by distillation at atmospheric pressure, bp 128–132°C [lit.3 bp 129–130.5°C].
The colorless filtrate is transferred to a distilling flask and the solvent is distilled through a 25-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. After a small forerun (1–2 g), 1-ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane is obtained at 43–45°C (12 mm) as a colorless liquid, 106 g (61%).
A solution of 294 g. (3 moles) of cyclohexanone, 343 g. (3.3 moles) of acetone dimethyl acetal, 418 g. (7.2 moles) of allyl alcohol, 1 l. of benzene, and 0.2 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is distilled using a good fractionating column until the acetone and the benzene-methanol azeotrope are completely removed. The solution is cooled below the boiling point, and a solution of 0.5 g. of sodium methoxide in 20 ml. of methanol is added all at once with stirring. Distillation is resumed, and unreacted allyl alcohol and benzene are removed at atmospheric pressure and then at reduced pressure. Distillation is continued at a pressure in the range 5–20 mm. to remove forerun (on the order of 100 ml.). The cyclohexanone diallyl acetal, b.p. 84°/5 mm., 98°/10 mm., 114°/20 mm., nD25 1.4600, is then collected. The yield is 382–435 g. (65–74%). A small amount of higher-boiling residue remains.
In a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed Hershberg stirrer,2 a 125-ml. dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 200 g. (250 ml., 3.78 moles) of acrylonitrile. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and then 75 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added dropwise over a period of about 1 hour while the temperature is maintained at 0–5°. From a clean dropping funnel, 108.1 g. (105 ml., 1.0 mole) of benzyl alcohol is added dropwise over about 1 hour at the same temperature. The clear, yellow mixture is held below 5° for about 3 hours longer and is then allowed to warm slowly to room temperature. After 2 days of stirring at room temperature the mixture is poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel containing about 1 l. of water and chopped ice. The mixture is shaken thoroughly and the resulting oil is taken up with 200 ml. of ethyl acetate. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted twice more with 200-ml. portions of solvent. The organic extracts are combined and washed successively with four 250-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, four 250-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and again with four portions of the salt solution. The neutral ethyl acetate extract is dried over 20 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. A fore-run of 1–3 g. of semisolid is obtained up to 120°/0.02 mm. The product is then collected as a light-yellow oil, b.p. 120–130°/0.01–0.02 mm., which solidifies in the chilled receiver. The distillate (97–101 g.) is melted on a steam bath and dissolved in a mixture of 50 ml. of benzene and 50 ml. of hexane. The solution is transferred quantitatively to a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and the solvent evaporated on a steam bath. The oily residue is placed in a refrigerator for at least 1 day to ensure complete crystallization. The white solid is transferred to a Büchner funnel with the aid of a little ice-cold hexane. After drying in air, the yield is 95–100 g. (59–62%) of N-benzylacrylamide, m.p. 65–68°.
After all the peracetic acid has been added, the reaction mixture is diluted with 80 ml. of water and heated from 35° to 100° over a 20-minute period. It is then kept at 100° for 45 minutes. The flask is cooled to 0–5° in an ice bath, and the solid iodoxybenzene is collected on a Büchner funnel and air-dried with suction for 1 hour. Additional material is obtained by concentrating the filtrate to one-fourth of its volume (Caution!). The two crops of crude iodoxybenzene are combined and dried overnight in a desiccator; weight 19.6–20.5 g.; m.p. 230° (Caution! Explodes!). Iodometric titration3 shows the purity to be about 94%.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 250 cc. of glacial acetic acid, 15 g. of red phosphorus, and 5 g. of iodine. The mixture is allowed to stand for fifteen to twenty minutes until the iodine has reacted, and then 5 cc. of water and 100 g. (0.44 mole) of benzilic acid (p. 89) are added. A reflux condenser is attached, and the mixture is boiled continuously for at least two and one-half hours. After the reaction is complete, the hot mixture is filtered with suction to remove the excess red phosphorus. The hot filtrate is slowly poured into a cold, well-stirred, filtered solution of 20–25 g. of sodium bisulfite in 1 l. of water. This procedure removes the excess iodine and precipitates the diphenylacetic acid as a fine white or slightly yellow powder. The product is filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried thoroughly on filter paper. The yield is 88–90 g. (94–97 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a solid melting at 141–144°. If a crystalline product is desired, the acid is dissolved in about 500 cc. of hot 50 per cent alcohol and then cooled. The melting point after recrystallization is 144–145°.
A solution of 21.3 g. (0.100 mole) of freshly distilled N,N-dimethyldodecylamine, 9.6 g. (0.10 mole) of 94% tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and 0.050 g. of vanadium oxyacetylacetonate in 27 g. (34 ml.) of tert-butyl alcohol is placed in a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a heating mantle. The reaction mixture is heated to approximately 65–70°, at which point an exothermic reaction begins. The heating is discontinued until the vigorous exothermic reaction subsides (about 5 minutes); the reaction mixture is then heated at reflux (the reaction mixture boils at 90°) for 25 minutes. After the resulting mixture has been cooled to room temperature, it is analyzed to establish the absence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide, then concentrated with a rotary evaporator (30–35° bath with 30–40 mm. pressure). The crude solid residue is triturated with 50 ml. of cold (0–5°), anhydrous diethyl ether and filtered under conditions which prevent exposure of the residual amine oxide to atmospheric moisture. The solid is washed with 50 ml. of cold (0–5°) anhydrous ether and dried under reduced pressure, leaving 12.9–15.5 g. of the crystalline amine oxide, m.p. 131–131.5°. Concentration of the mother liquors and trituration of the residual paste with 25 ml. of cold (0–5°) anhydrous ether separates another 4.9–3.4 g. of the amine oxide, m.p. 130–131°. The total yield of the crystalline amine oxide is 17.4–18.9 g. (76–83%).
In a 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, immersed in an ice-salt bath contained in a 2-gal. earthenware crock, is placed 150 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a small dropping funnel, and a thermometer reaching almost to the bottom of the flask. The stirrer is started, and, when the sulfuric acid has cooled to ice temperature or below, 60 g. (0.5 mole) of pure acetophenone is slowly dropped in from the dropping funnel at such a rate (about ten minutes for the addition) that the temperature does not rise above 5°. After the reaction mixture has cooled, this time to about −7°, the cooled (15–20°) nitrating mixture, consisting of 40 cc. (0.65 mole) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42 at 15.5°) and 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate (100–120 drops per minute) that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 0° or lower. After the nitrating acid has been added, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer and the contents of the flask are poured, with vigorous manual stirring, into a mixture of 750 g. of cracked ice and 1.5 l. of water. The product separates as a yellow flocculent solid.
C. 2-Methylbutanal-1-d. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a dropping funnel, a gas-inlet tube for steam, and a Dean-Stark trap attached to a condenser through which acetone cooled to −15° is circulated. A solution of 50.4 g. (0.400 mole) of oxalic acid dihydrate in 200 ml. of water is added to the flask and heated at reflux. Steam is introduced into the flask, and when it begins to condense in the Dean-Stark trap, the aldimine from part B is added dropwise from the funnel. The aldehyde and water collect in the trap, and the water layer is periodically removed. After the distillation of the aldehyde is complete, the product is drained from the trap; the water layer is separated and discarded. The oil is washed with three 25-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate. The crude aldehyde is decanted from the drying agent and distilled through a short Vigreux column, giving 13.0–13.3 g. (87–88%) of high-quality 2-methylbutanal-1-d, b.p. 92–93°, nD30 1.3896. The IR spectrum (neat) shows strong adsorption at 1721 cm.−1 attributable to the carbonyl function.
One kilogram (16.4 moles) of ice-cold ethanolamine is added, through a dropping funnel, with mechanical stirring, to 7 l. (9.94 kg., 52 moles) of ice-cold hydrobromic acid (sp. gr. 1.42) contained in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is attached to an efficient fractionating column and heated until 1850 cc. of distillate has been collected. The rate of heating is then diminished to a point at which the liquid ceases to distil and merely refluxes. The heating under reflux is continued for one hour. At the end of this time, 700 cc. more is distilled, and the solution is again heated under reflux for one hour. This procedure is followed with 600-, 300-, 250-, 150-, 100-, and 50-cc. portions of distillate. The process may be interrupted at any time. The solution is finally heated under reflux for three hours, and 2.3 l. of crude hydrobromic acid distilled. The total volume of distillate, including that which is collected during refluxing, must not be less than 6270 cc. or more than 6330 cc.
A. Preparation of di-μ-acetatobis[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclo-butadiene)cobalt]dipalladium ([COP-OAc]2). A flame-dried, single-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask is fitted with a stirring bar and an argon inlet. The flask is evacuated, refilled with argon and then, while temporarily removing the argon inlet, charged with (η5-(S)-2-(4-methylethyl)oxazolinylcyclopentadienyl)-(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)-cobalt (9.6 g, 16.2 mmol)2 and 96 mL of glacial acetic acid. Palladium(II) acetate (3.6 g, 16.2 mmol) is then added. The red solution is then heated at 95 °C (oil bath temperature) and the formation of an orange precipitate is observed. After 30 min, the solution is cooled to room temperature and filtered to provide an orange solid. This solid is washed with 50 mL of glacial acetic acid and dried under vacuum to provide 8.9 g (5.9 mmol, 73% yield) of di-μ-acetatobis[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt]dipalladium as a mustard-colored solid.
C. (S)-( − )-Methyloxirane. To a three-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 10-cm Vigreux column connected to an efficiently cooled condenser and receiver are added 9.05 g (50 mmol) of the acetoxybromopropane and 20 mL of dry 1-pentanol. The solution is stirred at room temperature and 41.66 mL (50 mmol) of 1.2 M potassium pentoxide in 1-pentanol is added from the dropping funnel over ca. 20 min. A white precipitate of potassium bromide is observed. After addition is complete, the flask is warmed in an oil bath at ca. 130–145°C to attain distillation. The product, (S)-( − )-methyloxirane, 2.0–2.35 g (69–81%), is collected as a colorless liquid, bp 34–35°C.
In a 500-ml. glass-stoppered Erlenmeyer flask, 30 g. (0.2 mole) of D-xylose and 10.7 g. (0.2 mole) of ammonium chloride are dissolved in 100 ml. of distilled water. Cracked ice (100 g.) is added to this mixture, followed by 10 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium cyanide, and the solution is maintained at 0–5° for 48 hours. Powdered barium hydroxide octahydrate (63 g., 0.2 mole) is added along with 100 ml. of water to the cyanohydrin mixture, which is heated on a steam bath for 2 hours with occasional stirring. The basic barium gulonate, which is allowed to separate overnight at 5°, is collected by filtration and washed with cold water (0°) until the washings are chloride-free. Excessive washing of the barium salt is to be avoided because of its solubility. The barium salt is suspended in 200 ml. of water, and the barium ion is precipitated quantitatively by sulfate ion. After removal of the barium sulfate by suction filtration, the filtrate and washings are concentrated to a colorless syrup on a steam bath in a stream of dry air. The resultant syrup is dissolved in 50 ml. of hot ethylene glycol monomethyl ether (methyl Cellosolve), sufficient ethyl acetate is added to incipient turbidity, and the solution is seeded with D-gulonic-γ-lactone. The lactone, which is allowed to crystallize overnight, is collected by suction filtration, washed with ethanol and dried in a vacuum over at 60°. The D-gulonic-γ-lactone has a melting point of 181–183° which is unchanged by recrystallization from aqueous ethanol. The yield is 10.7–11.6 g. (30–33%).
B. (+)-2-O-Benzyl-L-threitol.2 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is oven-dried (140°C) and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a reflux condenser equipped with a mineral oil bubbler that is connected to a nitrogen source. A slight pressure of gas is maintained in the apparatus throughout the course of the reaction. The flask is charged with 16.5 g (434 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride, and cooled to −30°C using an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath. Then 167 mL of dry diethyl ether is added with vigorous stirring and a solution of 57.8 g (434 mmol) of aluminum chloride in 134 mL of dry diethyl ether, is added dropwise during 40 min. Dry dichloromethane (134 mL) is placed in the addition funnel and added rapidly, while the temperature is allowed to rise to 0°C. A solution of 64.7 g (220 mmol) of diethyl (−)-2,3-O-benzylidene-L-tartrate in dry dichloromethane (134 mL) is added dropwise during 30 min. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature and heated to reflux for an additional 2 hr. The mixture is cooled to −20°C as above, and 14 mL of de-ionized water, followed by a solution of 31.5 g (561 mmol) of potassium hydroxide in 46 mL of de-ionized water, is added cautiously. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature until the grey color (probably due to unreacted lithium aluminum hydride) has completely disappeared. Efficient stirring is required throughout to ensure good yields. The mixture is filtered through a glass-sintered funnel containing a 2-cm pad of Celite, and the inorganic precipitate is extracted with 0.5 L of dichloromethane in a Soxhlet apparatus for 3 days. The combined extracts and filtrate are evaporated under reduced pressure (30 mm, 30°C). After drying over phosphorus pentoxide (P4O10) in an evacuated (1 mm) desiccator, 42.4 g (91%) of colorless crystals, mp 71–73°C, are obtained and used as such for step C. Recrystallization from dichloromethane gives 37.4 g (80%) of (+)-2-O-benzyl-L-threitol, mp 75–76°C.
B. Tetramethyl[2.2]paracyclophane-4,5,12,13-tetracarboxylate. The 1-L flask from Step A containing ca. 25–30 g (0.32–0.38 mol) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene in ether solution is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 40-cm Vigreux column for distillation at atmospheric pressure. A solution of 69.4 g (60 mL, 0.49 mol) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate in 220 mL of benzene is added. The resulting solution is stirred and heated at 45°C for 5–7 hr and at 70°C for 20 hr. The ether distils slowly at 45°C and rather rapidly at 70°C, the color of the solution changes from yellow to red–orange, and a white solid is gradually deposited. The mixture is cooled and filtered. Recrystallization of the solid from 600–800 mL of toluene affords 27–35 g of white crystalline product, mp 201.5–203°C. The original benzene filtrate and the toluene mother liquor, when evaporated to dryness and crystallized separately from 40–70 mL of toluene, provide 3–4 g and 2–3 g of product, respectively, having essentially the same melting point. The combined yield is 33–41 g (40–50% based on 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene) and.
A. N-(3,5-Dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamine (1). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with two glass stoppers, a magnetic stir bar and a reflux condenser fitted with a gas inlet connected to an argon-vacuum manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. After evacuating and backfilling with argon three times, the flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is sequentially charged with sodium tert-butoxide (19.22 g, 0.20 mol), 2-(dicyclohexylphosphino)biphenyl (0.50 g, 1.4 mmol), [Pd2(dba)3] (0.65 g, 0.71 mmol), toluene (200 mL), tert-butylamine (18.0 mL, 0.17 mol) and 5-bromo-1,3-dimethylbenzene (19.4 mL, 0.14 mol). The resulting viscous red reaction mixture is heated at 80 °C in an oil bath for 12 h while maintaining positive argon pressure. The solution color changes from dark red to orange red with white solids precipitating out. The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated to a residue by rotary evaporation (water bath temperature 50–55 °C) before cooling down to room temperature. tert-Butyl methyl ether (250 mL) and brine (80 mL) are added to the residue. After separation, the aqueous layer is extracted with tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 250 mL), the combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation, and the crude product is purified by distillation under vacuum (bp 50–53 °C, 10−3 mbar, oil bath temperature 70 °C) affording aniline 1 as colorless liquid (21.8 g, 86%).
C. 7-Aminotheophylline. The reaction flask of a steam distillation apparatus is charged with 19.6 g (0.069 mol) of 7-benzylideneaminotheophylline and 100 mL (0.1 mol) of 1 N hydrochloric acid. The suspension is steam-distilled until no more benzaldehyde is detected in the distillate. The resulting clear solution in the reaction flask is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 30 mL, adjusted to pH 10 with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with five 60-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation. The residue is recrystallized from 75 mL of water to afford 11.3 g (84%) of 7-aminotheophylline, mp 222°C.3
One hundred and ninety-four grams (170 ml., 1.67 moles) of levulinic acid and 500 ml. of 35% aqueous methylamine (sp. gr., 0.89; 3.94 moles of methylamine) are placed in a 2-l. steel reaction vessel of a high-pressure hydrogenation apparatus. Ten grams of Raney nickel catalyst1 is added, the vessel is closed, and hydrogen is admitted to a pressure of 1000–2000 lb. The bomb is then heated with continuous agitation to 140° and maintained at that temperature for 5 hours. The contents are removed, and the bomb is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water. After removal of the catalyst by filtration, the filtrate is distilled under reduced pressure using a good column. A low-boiling fore-run of water and methylamine distils first, followed by the product, a colorless liquid boiling at 84–86°/13 mm.; 102–104°/27 mm.; n25D 1.4611. The yield is 140–146 g. (74–77%).
One hundred thirty-eight grams (1 mole) of p-nitroaniline (East-man Technical grade) is dissolved in 370 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The burner is removed, and a mixture of 325 g. (2 moles) of iodine monochloride in 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added slowly from the dropping funnel with rapid stirring during thirty minutes. Considerable heat is evolved. The mixture is heated on a rapidly boiling water bath for two hours and then transferred to a 1-l. beaker and allowed to cool. The solidified mixture is treated with 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid and any hard lumps are crushed thoroughly with a flat glass stopper. The mixture is transferred to a large Büchner funnel and filtered by suction, two 25-cc. portions of glacial acetic acid being used to wash the last of the crystals into the funnel. The dark mother liquor is removed as completely as possible by suction. The crystals are returned to the beaker, thoroughly stirred with 200 cc. of cold glacial acetic acid, and transferred to the suction filter again. The beaker is rinsed with two 25-cc. portions of glacial acetic acid, and the crystals are sucked as dry as possible. The suction is shut off, and the crystals are wetted with 50 cc. of ether. The suction is again used to remove the ether. The product is air dried to constant weight (about twenty-four hours). The yield of air-dried diiodo-p-nitroaniline melting at 243–245° is 220–250 g. (56–64 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a condenser are placed 75 ml. of 60% sulfuric acid and 25 g. (0.093 mole) of α-(4-chlorophenyl)-γ-phenylacetoacetonitrile (p. 174). While being stirred, the mixture is heated at reflux until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases and. The mixture is cooled, poured into 200 ml. of ice water, and extracted three times with 150-ml. portions of ether. The ether solution is washed once with 50 ml. of water, twice with 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and then with 50 ml. of water. After drying over sodium sulfate and filtering, the ether is distilled on a steam bath, affording 15–17 g. (66–75%) of 1-(p-chlorophenyl)-3-phenyl-2-propanone, m.p. 34.5–35.5°. Recrystallization from 160 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°) gives 12–13 g. (53–57%) of product, m.p. 35.9–36.5°.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 2 kg. (1587 cc., 21.7 moles) of glycerol and 700 g. (585 cc., 12.9 moles) of technical 85 per cent formic acid. The flask is connected with a condenser set for downward distillation and the temperature within the reaction mixture is indicated by a thermometer, the bulb of which is immersed in the liquid. It is advisable to use as a receiver a distilling flask attached tightly to the lower end of the condenser. A tube is then run from the side arm of the distilling flask to a bottle of strong caustic soda to dissolve and decompose any acrolein which may be formed; a few pieces of clay plate are added to the distillation flask containing the reactants in order to prevent bumping, and it is then heated rapidly over a good ring burner. The first runnings should come over within fifteen minutes and a temperature of 195° should be reached in thirty to forty-five minutes. Slow heating causes charring and formation of much acrolein, and thus gives a very low yield of allyl alcohol. The distillate collected up to the point where the thermometer registers 195° is saved separately. Heating is continued until the temperature reaches 260°, the main reaction taking place between 225° and 235°. At 260°, when the heating should be stopped, a white smoke appears and decomposition apparently begins. The distillate (about 750 cc.) coming over between the thermometer readings between 195° and 260° is saved. For this operation about four hours are required.
The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, any sodium or sodium amide which may remain in the necks of the flask is scraped into the reaction mixture with a spatula, and enough water is added to dissolve the sodium bromide. The ether layer is separated and combined with five 100-ml. ether extracts of the aqueous phase, washed with 150 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is fractionated carefully under reduced pressure through a 4-ft. heated column packed with glass helices and fitted with a total-condensation variable take-off head. The yield of 2-allylcyclohexanone boiling at 90–92°/17 mm. is 153–174 g. (54–62%). In addition, 28–38 g. of unchanged cyclohexanone boiling at 51–52°/17 mm., 15–35 g. of diallylcyclohexanone boiling at 123–124°/17 mm., and small intermediate fractions are obtained.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1.5 kg. of dry corn cobs (ground to about the size of corn kernels), 5 l. of 10 per cent sulfuric acid, and 2 kg. of salt. The flask is shaken in order to secure a homogeneous mixture and is then connected with an upright tube, water condenser, and return tube as shown in Fig. 17, p. 282. Heat is applied from a ring burner, the flame being adjusted so that the liquid distils at a rapid rate.
B. 2-Ethoxy-1-naphthaldehyde. A mixture of 45 g. (0.33 mole) of N-methylformanilide (p. 590), 51 g. (0.33 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride, and 43 g. (0.25 mole) of β-naphthyl ethyl ether in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask provided with an air condenser is heated on a steam bath for 6 hours. The hot mixture is then poured in a thin stream into 700 ml. of cold water with very vigorous stirring to avoid the formation of large lumps; the aldehyde separates in a granular condition. It is filtered by suction and washed thoroughly, using 1 l. of water. Without drying, the crude aldehyde is dissolved in 450 ml. of ethanol and decolorized by the addition of 4 g. of Norit, boiling for 15 minutes, and filtering hot, using a double filter paper. The filtrate is cooled, and the product is collected on a filter and washed with 40 ml. of cold ethanol; it crystallizes in pale yellow needles, m.p. 111–112°. The yield is 37–42 g. (74–84%).
A. N-Benzyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine. An oven-dried, 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser is charged with 12.58 g (0.1 mol) of chloromethyltrimethylsilane. Benzylamine (33.1 g, 0.3 mol) is added with stirring and the resulting solution is heated at 200°C for 2.5 hr. At the end of this time a 0.1 N sodium hydroxide solution is added in order to hydrolyze the white organic salt that had formed. The mixture is extracted with ether and the ether layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 6-in. Vigreux column to give 11.6–15.3 g (58–72%) of N-benzyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine, bp 68–72°C (0.7–0.8 mm).
The crude product is purified by dissolving it in a boiling mixture of 900 ml. of water and 110 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19), and filtering the hot solution through a Norit bed using suction. The filter bed is washed with a boiling mixture of 90 ml. of water and 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the washings are added to the main body of the solution. The filtered solution, while still hot, is treated with 100 ml. of concentrated ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The precipitated 1,2-diamino-4-nitrobenzene is filtered hot on a Büchner funnel, washed on the funnel with 150 ml. of water, and dried in an oven at 40–50°.
The reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of 25 mL of ice water and slowly acidified to pH 2 with 75 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 75-mL portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the original ether layer, washed successively with 50 mL of water, two 50-mL portions of aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate, and 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration, the solvent is removed at aspirator vacuum on a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled through a short column to give 8.8–10.2 g (66–76%) of 3-phenylpropionaldehyde, bp 87°C (1.0 mm),(Note 6),(Note 7).
For purification, the product is dissolved in 800 ml. of 1 N sodium hydroxide, 500 ml. of ethanol is added, and the solution is filtered. The filtrate is transferred to a 2-l. beaker and is heated to the boiling point. Then 160 ml. of 5 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added, through a dropping funnel, while stirring by hand. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and is filtered with suction. The product is washed with 100 ml. of ethanol, then with 200 ml. of water, and is dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The nearly white, lustrous platelets have no definite melting point. The yield of pure amino acid is 98–112 g. (33–37%).
Water (200 ml.) is added, the mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and shaken. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–68°). The organic layers are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
Agitation is continued for 30 minutes after all the chloride has been introduced, and the excess hydride is then destroyed by the careful, dropwise addition of water to the stirred and cooled reaction mixture. The hydrolysis is accompanied by the formation of a white curdy mass of aluminum hydroxide, and the mixture has a semisolid consistency when the hydride has been completely decomposed. With constant stirring, 500 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid is then added slowly to the mass. Stirring is continued for 30 minutes, and the solution becomes clear during this period.
The formic acid and water are removed by distillation from a steam bath under reduced pressure. An ice-cold solution of 80 g. of sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added in small portions to the residual viscous mixture of the diol and its formates, with care that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 45°. The alkaline solution is warmed to 45°, and an equal volume (350 ml.) or more of ethyl acetate is added. After thorough extraction, the lower layer is separated and extracted at 45° six times with equal volumes of ethyl acetate. The seven ethyl acetate solutions are combined (total volume about 2.1 l.), and the solvent is distilled from a steam bath until the residual volume is 300–350 ml. and the solid product begins to crystallize. The mixture is cooled to 0°, and the product is separated by filtration (77–90 g., melting in the range of 90–98°). The mother liquor is concentrated on a steam bath to a volume of 65–75 ml., and more solid crystallizes. The mixture is cooled and filtered as before and yields an additional 4–15 g. of crude product melting in the range of 80–89°. trans-1,2-Cyclohexanediol, b.p. 120–125°/4 mm., is obtained by distillation of the combined crude products, with the use of an oil bath and a flask having a side arm and an air condenser sufficiently wide that they will not become plugged as the product solidifies. The yield of product of m.p. 101.5–103° is 75–85 g. (65–73%).
It may be recrystallized by dissolving it in 85–90 ml. of hot 95% ethanol and slowly adding 450 ml. of acetone to the solution. The recovery is about 90%. The purified material, dried at 70°, melts at 155–156° and.
In a 500-ml. distilling flask fitted with a thermometer extending to within 0.5 in. of the bottom are placed 110 g. (1.2 moles) of cuprous cyanide and 143 g. (118 ml., 1.02 moles) of purified benzoyl chloride. The flask is shaken to moisten almost all the cuprous cyanide and is placed in an oil bath which has been previously heated to 145–150°. The temperature of the bath is raised to 220–230° and maintained between these limits for 1.5 hours. During the heating the flask is frequently removed from the bath (about every 15 minutes) and the contents are thoroughly mixed by vigorous shaking. At the end of the 1.5 hours the flask is connected with an air-cooled condenser set for downward distillation. The temperature of the bath is slowly raised to 305–310°, and distillation is continued until no more product comes over. About 100–112 g. of crude benzoyl cyanide boiling at 207–218°/745 mm. is obtained.
A slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the flask above the surface of the stirred liquid, and a mixture of 250 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol and 200 ml. of anhydrous ether is added from the dropping funnel just fast enough to maintain mild boiling. When all the potassium has dissolved, the nitrogen is shut off. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, and 2.5 l. of anhydrous ether is added. Diethyl oxalate (146 g., 1.00 mole) is added with stirring, followed after 10 minutes by 137 g. (1.00 mole) of o-nitrotoluene. Stirring is discontinued after an additional 10 minutes, and the mixture is poured, with the aid of a connecting tube, into a 5-l. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is stoppered and set aside for at least 24 hours. The lumpy deep-purple potassium salt of ethyl o-nitrophenylpyruvate is separated by filtration and washed with anhydrous ether until the filtrate remains colorless. The yield of the air-dried salt is 204–215 g. (74–78%).
The aqueous layer is combined with the two neutral aqueous extracts and acidified by addition of 45 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure at 60–70° until no more distillate comes over. The residue, which solidifies on cooling, is dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets to yield 30.7–32.7 g. (90–96%) of crude N,N-dimethylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, m.p. 103–106° (sealed tube). Crystallization from 40 ml. of isopropyl alcohol gives 26.6–30.7 g. (78–90%) of the pure hydrochloride, m.p. 106–108° (sealed tube).
B. (R)-(N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl)allylglycine. A flame-dried, 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 35 mL of liquid ammonia and 124 mg (17.8 mmol) of lithium metal. The resulting solution is stirred at −33°C. Meanwhile, a flame-dried 25-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a rubber stopper and an argon inlet is charged with 539 mg (1.37 mmol) of (3R,5R,6S)-4-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenyl-3-(1'-prop-2'enyl)morpholin-2-one (p.18), 0.150 mL of absolute ethanol, and 5 mL of anhydrous THF. The resulting mixture is then transferred via cannula to the lithium/liquid ammonia solution. After 20 min, the reaction is carefully quenched with solid ammonium chloride and allowed to warm to room temperature. After evaporation of the remaining ammonia, the residue is diluted with 35 mL of water and extracted twice with 35-mL portions of diethyl ether. The aqueous phase is carefully acidified with 1N HCl to a pH of 2 while stirring with 35 mL of ethyl acetate. Following separation of the organic phase, the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 20-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The organic extracts are combined, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated under vacuum to yield 178 mg (60%) of crude (R)-(N-tert-butoxycarbonyl)allylglycine (% ee ≥ 96%) as a viscous oil.
B. (4- ((4R, 5R)-4,5- Diphenyl-1,3- dioxolan-2-yl) phenoxy) (tert- butyl)dimethylsilane. A 500-mL, oven-dried, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser (fitted with an argon gas inlet), a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, and a thermocouple is charged with (1R,2R)-1,2-diphenylethane-1,2-diol (6.43 g, 30.0 mmol), toluene (96.0 mL), MeCN (32.0 mL), and (4-(dimethoxymethyl)phenoxy)(tert-butyl)dimethylsilane (9.27 g, 32.8 mmol). After stirring the solution for 3 min, pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (2.26 g, 9.0 mmol) is added. The reaction mixture is heated in a 50 °C oil bath (internal temperature: 45 °C) and is stirred for 1 h. The mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and then is poured into sat. aq. NaHCO3 solution (100 mL) in a 1-L separatory funnel, and the suspension is extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with sat. aq. NaCl solution (2 × 100 mL), then are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (20 g), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure to give a yellow, viscous oil. The residue is purified by silica gel column chromatography (elution with hexanes/CH2Cl2, 7:3) to give a colorless, viscous oil (12.33 g) which is triturated with MeOH to yield (4-((4R,5R)-4,5-diphenyl-1,3- dioxolan-2-yl)phenoxy) (tert-butyl) dimethylsilane as a white solid (11.51 g, 89%).
In A is placed a solution of 469 g. (3.5 moles) of propiophenone in 2.3 l. of ordinary ethyl ether, and in B a mixture of 290 g. (4 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite, 180 cc. (142 g., 4.5 moles) of methyl alcohol, and 170 cc. of water. In the dropping funnel C is placed 455 cc. of cold dilute sulfuric acid (prepared by adding one volume of concentrated acid to two volumes of water).
A. 4-Bromo-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol. A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a gas inlet, rubber septum, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, magnetic stirring bar, and a gas outlet tube that is connected to a gas trap containing 0.5 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). The flask is charged with 103.2 g (500 mmol) of 2,6-di-tert-butylphenol and flushed with argon, after which 200 mL of dry dichloromethane is added. The dropping funnel is charged with 28.2 mL (550 mmol) of bromine and 20 mL of dry dichloromethane. The reaction vessel is immersed in an ice-water bath, stirring is initiated, and bromine in dichloromethane is added over 1 hr. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for 10–20 min. Then 60 mL of saturated aqueous sodium sulfite is added slowly at 0°C and stirring is continued at room temperature until the light orange color of bromine is discharged, The mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The heavier organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated with a vacuum rotary evaporator. The residue is recrystallized twice from ethanol-water (first with 130 mL of ethanol and 18 mL of water, then with 110 mL of ethanol and 11 mL of water) to furnish 109 g (76% yield) of 4-bromo-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol as light yellow crystals, mp 83–85°C. Pure 4-bromo-2,6-di-tert-butylphenol is reported to melt at 81–82°C.2
A mixture of 96 g. (1.04 moles) of glycerol and 96 cc. of water is slowly introduced in the course of thirty minutes and the temperature is allowed to rise to 85–90°. The mixture is carefully heated to 120° during one and one-half hours, in such a way that the temperature rises uniformly at a rate of 1° every three minutes. A temperature of 118–120° is maintained for an additional three-hour period; then the mixture is cooled to 70–80° and carefully poured with stirring into 4 l. of boiling water. Spattering is avoided by pouring the acid mixture down the walls of the beaker while stirring. The suspension is boiled for a few minutes and preferably allowed to stand for several hours before being filtered.
A. (R,R)-( + )-N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyltartaric acid diamide. Into a mixture of 618 g (3 mol) of diethyl tartrate and 600 mL of freshly distilled methanol in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask is poured at least 450 mL (7 mol) of liquid, anhydrous, cold (−78°C) dimethylamine. The mixture is swirled briefly and then allowed to stand in a hood for 3 days with a drying tube in place. After seeding and cooling in a refrigerator overnight, the massive crystals are collected by suction filtration. The filtrate is concentrated, seeded, and cooled to yield a second crop. The combined crystals are washed with cold methanol (−30°C) and dried under reduced pressure at 70–100°C (oil bath). The diamide thus obtained is sufficiently pure to be used in the following step. The yield is 570–580 g (93–95%). Recrystallization from methanol–ethyl acetate furnishes an analytically pure sample, mp 189–190°C, [α]D +43° (ethanol, c 3.0).
Sufficient water (300–800 cc.) is now added to the mixture to dissolve the pasty chromium salts. The mass of crystals is then rapidly filtered on a Büchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible. The crystals are then transferred to a small laboratory centrifuge and centrifuged for several minutes. The crystals are washed in the centrifuge with about 15–25 cc. of ice water, then with 10–15 cc. of cold petroleum ether, and finally centrifuged until as dry as possible. The crude dichloroacetone is dried in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid overnight. It weighs about 220 g.
The distilled mixture of dodecenoic acids is dissolved in 150 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol containing 1.3 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and allowed to stand in a stoppered flask for 2 hours at 20°. The solution is diluted with 600 ml. of water and extracted with two 150-ml. portions of 60–68° petroleum ether. The extracts are washed with water and percolated through a Kies extraction apparatus consisting of three stages containing, respectively, 9.9 g. of 85% potassium hydroxide (0.15 mole) in 250 ml. of 20% ethanol, 2.5 g. of 85% potassium hydroxide (0.038 mole) in 125 ml. of 20% ethanol, and 125 ml. of water. An additional 250 ml. of petroleum ether is then passed through the extraction apparatus. The three aqueous layers are combined, acidified to Congo red with 5N sulfuric acid, and extracted with petroleum ether. The combined organic layers are washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation and the residue distilled in a modified Claisen flask. The yield of colorless 2-dodecenoic acid, b.p. 155–158°/3 mm., 127–130°/0.15 mm., is 8–10 g. (27–34%), nD25 1.4629, λmax 210 mμ (ε 13,650) in hexane, m.p. 13–18°.
The yield is 147–160 g. (68–74 per cent of the theoretical amount). It sinters at 190–191° and melts at 199–200° (corr.). A sample twice recrystallized from glacial acetic acid melted at 200–202° (corr.). The crystal form of this product compares very favorably with that of quinizarin of the highest purity, as observed under the microscope.
C. (Chloromethoxy)(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilane (3). An oven-dried 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is capped with a rubber septum pierced with a nitrogen inlet needle connected to a gas bubbler. A thermocouple thermometer probe is also inserted through the septum. (1,1-Dimethylethyl)[(ethylthio)methoxy]dimethylsilane (2) (12.1 g, 58.6 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and dichloromethane (120 mL) are added to the flask. The stirred solution is cooled to 2 °C using an ice-water bath. Sulfuryl chloride (8.14 g, 60.3 mmol, 1.03 equiv) is added via a 10 mL syringe over 10 min, keeping the temperature <5 °C. During the addition the reaction mixture turns yellow. After the addition, the ice-bath is removed and the solution is stirred for 20 min. The stir bar is removed and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (70 mmHg, bath temperature 40 °C) to afford crude 3 (12.4 g). Vacuum distillation provides (chloromethoxy)(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilane (3) as a slightly yellow liquid (8.41-8.66 g, 80-82 % yield).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser connected to a gas trap, are placed 2 l. (12.1 moles) of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid and 500 g. (5.05 moles) of allyl isothiocyanate. The mixture is refluxed over a free flame until the upper layer of allyl isothiocyanate has completely disappeared, about fifteen hours being required for the hydrolysis. When the reaction is complete, the solution is poured into a 3-l. beaker and concentrated on the steam bath until crystals begin to form in the hot solution. This occurs when the volume is approximately 400 cc..
A. 1,2,4,5-Hexatetraene in ether solution. A 2-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite), a dropping funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 0.5 g (0.002 mol) of mercury(II) chloride and 29.2 g (1.2 mol) of magnesium turnings that have been crushed with a mortar and pestle, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen while being heated externally with a Bunsen burner to remove traces of moisture. In the cooled flask are placed 160 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether and 7.6 g (5.0 mL, 0.064 mol) of propargyl bromide. The ether begins to reflux within 1 min, indicating that formation of the Grignard reagent has begun. The mixture is cooled to 5° in an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as a solution of 135 g (89 mL, 1.13 mol) of propargyl bromide in 560 mL of anhydrous ether is added. The addition rate is adjusted so as to maintain the internal temperature between 5°C and 10°C. The cooling bath is removed, and the dark green mixture is stirred for 45 min at room temperature. A 2-g (0.02 mol) portion of finely pulverized, dry copper(I) chloride is added, and the mixture, which becomes a chocolate-brown color after 2–3 min, is stirred for 15 min at room temperature and cooled again to 5°C with either an ice-water bath or an ice-salt bath. Stirring is continued while a solution of 128 g (85 mL, 1.08 mol) of propargyl bromide in 100 mL of ether is added at a rate such that the internal temperature is kept at ca. 20°C. The mixture becomes almost black, and two phases are discernible when the stirrer is stopped, especially toward the end of the addition. The cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 15 min at room temperature to complete the dimerization. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C with an ice-salt bath and stirred vigorously as 200 mL of 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid is added. The two-phase mixture is warmed to room temperature, and another 100 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid is added. The ether layer is separated and washed with three 100-mL portions of water. A few crystals (0.2–0.5 g) of hydroquinone are added to stabilize the reddish solution, which is then dried with anhydrous potassium carbonate. The drying agent is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to a volume of ca. 400 mL by distillation under nitrogen at atmospheric pressure with a 40-cm Vigreux column and a heating bath kept at 40–45°C. The concentrate is purified by vacuum transfer, and the now colorless solution, which contains ca. 25–30 g (30–36%) of 1,2,4,5-hexatetraene, is stabilized by adding another 0.1–0.5 g of hydroquinone and.
In a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical overhead stirrer, addition funnel, and thermometer are placed 484 g (4.4 mol) of cis-cyclooctene, 3 L of reagent methanol, 330 g (8.04 mol) of acetonitrile, and 77 g (0.77 mol) of potassium bicarbonate. To the resulting heterogeneous mixture is added dropwise 522 g (4.6 mol) of 30% hydrogen peroxide with cooling at a rate that maintains the temperature of the reaction at 25–35°C. Following the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is divided in half, and each portion is diluted with 500 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution. Each portion is then extracted with four 500-mL portions of methylene chloride. The organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure by rotary evaporation. Short-path distillation of the crude product under reduced pressure gives 333–337 g (60–61%) of cis-cyclooctene oxide, bp 85–87°C (20 mm), as a white solid, mp 53–56°C.
A dry, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a thermometer (−100° to 50°), a magnetic stirrer, and two dry-ice condensers (one condenser is capped with a drying tube, the other with a gas-inlet tube). The apparatus is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 300 ml. of trichlorofluoromethane is added to the flask. As the nitrogen atmosphere is maintained, the trichlorofluoromethane is cooled to −70° with an acetone–dry ice bath, and 119 g. (1.10 moles) of sulfur tetrafluoride is added from a cylinder through the gas-inlet tube, which is then replaced with a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with a solution of 145 g. (1.00 mole) of N,N-diethylaminotrimethylsilane in 90 ml. of trichlorofluoromethane. This solution is added dropwise, with stirring, to the sulfur tetrafluoride solution at a rate slow enough to keep the temperature of the reaction mixture below −60° (about 40 minutes). The cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually to room temperature. The apparatus is prepared for distillation with a simple distillation head, and the solvent (b.p. 24°) and by-product fluorotrimethylsilane (b.p. 17°) are distilled into a well-cooled receiver by warming the reaction mixture gently to 45° with a heating mantle. The yellow to dark-brown residual liquid is transferred and distilled at reduced pressure through a spinning-band column, yielding 131 g. (81%) of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride as a light yellow liquid, b.p. 46–47° (10 mm.). This product can be stored for several months at room temperature in an inert plastic bottle (such as one made of polypropylene or Teflon FEP), or for short periods of time in a dry, glass bottle.
B. 3-Methylcoumarilic acid. Ethyl 3-methylcoumarilate (70 g.) and 500 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution are refluxed for 1 hour. The clear yellowish solution is acidified while hot with a slight excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid to precipitate the 3-methylcoumarilic acid. The suspension is cooled to room temperature, and the colorless solid is filtered with suction. The filter cake is resuspended in 500 ml. of cold water, stirred vigorously for several minutes, and filtered again with suction. The colorless powder, after being dried in a desiccator under reduced pressure, weighs 54–57 g. (90–95%) and melts at 192–193°.
Recrystallization of 20 g. of this product from 230 ml. of hot ethyl alcohol affords 17.8 g. of fine colorless needles, m.p. 199.5–202.5°.
B. 1,6-Dimethyltricyclo[4,1.0.02,7]hept-3-ene. A solution of 20.95 g (0.075 mol) of 7,7-dibromo-1,6-dimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene in 500 mL of anhydrous ether is placed in a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, addition funnel, and nitrogen-inlet tube. With stirring under nitrogen and external cooling in an ice bath, 50 mL of 1.6 M ethereal methyllithium in 70 mL of ether (0.08 mol) is introduced by dropwise addition during 30 min. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. After 100 mL of water has been cautiously introduced, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. This solution is washed with water (3 × 100 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and carefully concentrated by slow distillation through a 40-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure, heating at <60°C. The residual liquid is distilled through a short, unpacked column to give 4.2–4.4 g (46–49%) of colorless oil, bp 48–49°C (23 mm). Under the proper conditions, this hydrocarbon can be stored for 2 weeks at −5°C without deterioration.
The following day the acid liquid is filtered with suction through a large Büchner funnel, to remove large quantities of humus which are produced. The humus on the filter is washed with two 350-cc. portions of water and finally with two 300-cc. portions of benzene. The filtered liquid and aqueous washings have a volume of approximately 10 l. The 5-methylfurfural is removed from the aqueous layer by extraction with benzene, using three 300-cc. portions of the solvent for each 2 l. of liquid. The combined benzene extracts (about 5 l.) are divided into two or three portions; each is washed with two 150-cc. portions of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution and two 100-cc. portions of water. The benzene solution is dried with 100–150 g. of anhydrous magnesium or sodium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation from a 1-l. flask provided with a short fractionating column and a separatory funnel for the continuous introduction of the solution. The distillation is stopped when the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 85°.
C. (R,R)-N,N'-Bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical overhead stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition funnel is charged with 29.7 g of (R,R)-1,2-diammoniumcyclohexane mono-(+)-tartrate salt (0.112 mol), 31.2 g of potassium carbonate (0.225 mol, 2 eq), and 150 mL of water. The mixture is stirred until dissolution is achieved, and 600 mL of ethanol is added. The cloudy mixture is heated to reflux with a heating mantle and a solution of 53.7 g (0.229 mol, 2.0 eq) of 3,5-di-tert-butylsalicylaldehyde in 250 mL of ethanol is then added in a slow stream over 30 min. The addition funnel is rinsed with 50 mL of ethanol and the mixture is stirred at reflux for 2 hr before heating is discontinued. Water, 150 mL, is added and the stirred mixture is cooled to ≤5°C over 2 hr and maintained at that temperature for another hour. The yellow solid is collected by vacuum filtration and washed with 100 mL of ethanol . After the solid is air dried, it is dissolved in 500 mL of methylene chloride . The organic solution is washed with 2 × 300 mL of water, followed by 300 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride . The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate , and filtered to remove the drying agent. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to yield the product as a yellow solid, mp 200-203°C and.
A 500-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient stirrer, a reflux condenser, a 250-ml. dropping funnel, and a low-temperature thermometer. In the flask are placed 34.4 g. (21.8 ml., 0.25 mole) of phosphorus trichloride and 150 ml. of anhydrous ether. A solution of 0.50 mole of isopropylmagnesium chloride in about 150 ml. of ether and is placed in the dropping funnel.
The residue in the flask, which has become pink in color, is extracted at 85–95° with three 1500-cc. portions of toluene, and the united extracts are distilled under reduced pressure on the steam bath until no more moisture passes over with the vapor. The solution (2–2.5 l.) is then allowed to cool, whereupon 385–390 g. of catechol separates in colorless plates melting at 104–105°. The mother liquor is further concentrated under reduced pressure and the residue finally distilled, pure catechol passing over at 124–125° / 12 mm. The distillate, on recrystallization from a small quantity of toluene, yields 8–10 g. of pure material.
(B) Allyl Cyanide.—In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser and a mechanical stirrer are placed 220 g. (1.83 moles) of allyl bromide and 170 g. (1.9 moles) of dry cuprous cyanide. The mixture is heated in a water bath and the stirrer rotated slowly by hand until the reaction starts (about fifteen to thirty minutes). When the reaction once begins, it becomes vigorous, and the heating bath must be replaced by a cooling mixture of ice and water in order to avoid loss of product through the condenser. After the vigorous reaction has subsided, the water bath is replaced, the mechanical stirrer is started and the mixture is heated until no more allyl bromide refluxes. This requires about one hour.
B. 3-(S)-[(tert-Butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]-2-butanone. An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 20.0 g (56.2 mmol) of ethyl 2-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]propanoate and the flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 100-mL addition funnel, and a rubber septum. A low temperature thermometer is inserted through the rubber septum and 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is injected with a syringe. The mechanically stirred solution is cooled to −105°C and maintained until the temperature has stabilized. The addition funnel is charged with 52 mL of a 1.4 M ether solution of halide-free methyllithium (73 mmol) and this solution is added dropwise with mechanical stirring over 35–40 min. The internal temperature is never allowed to rise above −100°C. When addition is complete, 20 mL (158 mmol) of trimethylsilyl chloride is injected and the resulting clear solution is warmed to room temperature over 20 min with the aid of a water bath. At this time 200 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid is added and vigorous stirring is continued for 1 hr. The mixture is poured slowly into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 30 g of solid sodium bicarbonate and then concentrated to remove tetrahydrofuran under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The resulting aqueous suspension is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layer is washed with two 400-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator to give 18.2 g (99%) of 3-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]-2-butanone as a clear colorless oil and.
B. Methylmagnesium iodide. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 9.7 g (0.4 g-atom) of magnesium turnings is equipped with a rubber septum, reflux condenser, an addition funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar. The system is flame-dried and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous ether (20 mL,) is introduced to cover the magnesium. As the contents of the flask are stirred, iodomethane (56.7 g, 0.4 mol) in 180 mL of anhydrous ether is added dropwise through the addition funnel. The addition requires about 2 hr; the mixture is then stirred for an additional 30 min.
A. 2-Methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)-1,3-cyclopentanedione. A 1.0-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and thermometer is charged with 112.1 g (1.0 mol) of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione, 230 mL of deionized water, 3.0 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 140 mL (120.96 g, 1.72 mol) of methyl vinyl ketone. The system is shielded from light with aluminum foil and placed under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen. The flask is placed in an oil bath and the temperature is raised to 70°C. The reaction is monitored by gas chromatography (GLC,) until complete (1–2 hr). The mixture is cooled, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with 500 mL and then two 100-ml portions of dichloromethane. The combined extracts are washed with 500 and 100 mL of saturated brine. The combined brine wash is extracted with a further two 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The total dichloromethane extract is dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 45°C (70 mm). Drying on the rotary evaporator at 40–45°C (0.03 mm) for 16 hr gives 181.8 g (100%) of the desired triketone as an orange oil and.
The 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione thus obtained can be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol, using about 20 ml. of ethanol for each 5 g. of product to give colorless crystals, m.p. 208–210° dec., with only minor loss of material.
A mixture of 30.6 g (0.1 mol) of pure chlorotriphenylmethane and 12.2 g (0.1 mol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine is placed in a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel and a Y-tube holding a thermometer and a nitrogen (N2) inlet adapter. To the mixture is added, with continuous stirring, 200 mL of dry dichloromethane (CH2Cl2,) through the dropping funnel. After the addition, stirring is continued for an additional 3 hr at 20-25°C under N2.
The combined precipitate from the two batches is carefully washed with 500 ml. of 20% ammonium chloride solution, two 400-ml. portions of 95% ethanol, and two 300-ml. portions of cold water. The product is sucked as dry as possible in the suction funnel.
The reaction mixture is transferred to a 300-ml. separatory funnel and is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution of diethyl isonitrosomalonate is used in the next step immediately or, if desired, may be used after storage in a refrigerator overnight.
A second, dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, vacuum pump connection, and argon atmosphere. The (top) pentane layer from the first flask, which contains the bis(trimethylsilyl)imidate, is carefully transferred to the second flask by cannula, maintaining the argon atmosphere, and leaving the oily triethylammonium trifluoromethanesulfonate layer behind. This remaining salt is triturated with 30 mL of a dry 2:1 pentane/ether mixture by stirring for 15 min, allowing the layers to separate, then transferring the extract to the second flask as before. The trituration is repeated with a 30-mL portion of anhydrous ether, and the combined extracts in the second flask are concentrated with stirring to about 1/3 volume using the vacuum pump.
A solution of 24.3 g. (0.125 mole) of piperazine hexahydrate in 50 ml. of absolute ethanol, contained in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, is warmed in a bath at 65° as there is dissolved in the solution, by swirling, 22.1 g. (0.125 mole) of piperazine dihydrochloride monohydrate. As warming in the bath at 65° is continued, there is added during 5 minutes, with vigorous swirling or stirring, 15.8 g. (14.3 ml., 0.125 mole) of recently distilled benzyl chloride. The separation of white needles commences almost immediately. After the solution has been stirred for an additional 25 minutes at 65°, it is cooled, and the unstirred solution is kept in an ice bath for about 30 minutes. The crystals of piperazine dihydrochloride monohydrate are collected by suction filtration, washed with three 10-ml. portions of ice-cold absolute ethanol, and then dried. Recovery of the dihydrochloride is 21.5–22.0 g. (97–99%).
4. The second checkers recrystallized the crude product from benzene-hexanes at 45 ï¿½C according to the following procedure. The crude product (15.7 g) was taken up in 0.3 mL of water and 10 ml of benzene at 45 ï¿½C. Hexanes (8 mL) were then added slowly until the solution became cloudy. An addition 4 mL of benzene was then added dropwise at 45 ï¿½C until the solution became clear. The solution was allowed to cool and let stand at 15 ï¿½C for 3 h. The resulting colorless crystals were filtered on a Buchner funnel washing with ca. 14 mL of cold hexanes. The hexane-benzene filtrate was concentrated to provide a mother liquor for further crystallization. The crystals collected by the filtration were found to be contaminated with unreacted cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid, which was removed by washing with 100 mL of ice-cold water, leaving 6.40 g of pure 2. The filtrate was extracted with three 30-mL portions of Et2O, concentrated, and then washed further with 40-mL of ice-cold water to afford an additional 1.12 g of 2. A second crop of product (2.33 g) was obtained by applying a similar procedure to the mother liquor. Total yield: 9.85 g (56%) of 2. Due to volatility, the product should be air-dried and not exposed to high vacuum.
A. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a nitrogen outlet, internal temperature probe, 125-mL addition funnel (capped with a septum and nitrogen inlet), and a 65 × 20 mm egg-shaped magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen, then charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxycyclopentene (20.8 g, 133 mmol), hexanes (208 mL), and triethylamine (22.3 mL, 16.2 g, 160 mmol, 1.2 equiv). The addition funnel is charged with hexanes (100 mL) and dichloroacetyl chloride (12.8 mL, 19.6 g, 133 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and this solution is added dropwise to the vigorously stirred reaction mixture at a rate that maintains effective stirring and an internal temperature below 30 °C (the addition requires 30-40 min). A white precipitate (Et3N·HCl) forms during the addition, turning to a brown slurry upon complete addition. The slurry is stirred for 12 h, at which time GC analysis shows approximately 10% starting enol ether. An additional portion of dichloroacetyl chloride (1.5 mL, 2.3 g, 16 mmol, 0.12 equiv) in 3 mL of hexanes is added to the reaction mixture via the addition funnel. After 1 h, GC/MS analysis shows no remaining starting material. A sintered-glass Büchner funnel (8 cm diameter, 350 mL capacity) is charged with 40 g of silica gel slurried in hexanes, and the reaction mixture is filtered with suction through this pad into a 2-L filter flask rinsing with an additional 600 mL of hexanes in three portions. The clear, pale-yellow filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a pale-yellow liquid which crystallizes to a yellow solid when stored in the freezer (7 °C ) (29.9 g, 112 mmol, 84% yield). This material is used without further purification in the next step.
The claret-colored solution (5.2–5.8 l.) is filtered through a fluted filter paper in a 15-cm. funnel into 1.2 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in an 8-l. bottle. The aminonaphthol hydrochloride starts to precipitate immediately. The mixture is allowed to stand for at least two hours with occasional agitation to ensure complete precipitation. The hydrochloride is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and washed successively with three small portions of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid and three 50-cc. portions of ether. It is then dried in the air in thin layers on filter paper. The yield is 180–200 g. of anhydrous material (66–74 per cent of the theoretical amount based on 200 g. of β-naphthol). The hydrochloride is unstable; in solution it decomposes rapidly, but this decomposition can largely be prevented by the addition of sodium bisulfite. The dry solid slowly changes and should be used within a few weeks of its preparation.
In a 2-l. beaker is placed 75 g. (0.4 mole) of 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene, and to it is added the hot diluted acid obtained by adding 72 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid to 200 ml. of water. The clear solution is stirred and cooled to about 15°, after which 180 g. of ice is added; the amine sulfate usually separates. As soon as the temperature has dropped below +5°, a solution of 32.2 g. (0.47 mole) of sodium nitrite in 88 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel, the stem of which extends below the surface of the liquid. The temperature of the solution is kept below +5° during the addition, which requires about 15 minutes. The solution is stirred for 5 minutes after the addition of all the sodium nitrite, and 300 g. of cold water, 3 g. of urea, and 300 g. of cracked ice are then added successively. The solution is kept in an ice bath until used.
A. 2,5-Di-tert-butyl-5,6-dichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione. A 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 110 g. (0.500 mole) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone and 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The reaction flask is equipped with an efficient magnetic stirring bar, and chlorine gas is introduced through a safety trap into the well-stirred mixture. During the course of the reaction, which should be completed in 35–40 minutes, the mixture becomes homogeneous and warms to about 60°. The mixture is flushed with nitrogen to expel excess chlorine. During this process the product crystallizes from the solution; precipitation is completed by cooling the reaction mixture to 20°. The mixture is filtered, and the product is washed with 1 l. of water and air dried, yielding 112 g. (77%) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-5,6-dichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione, m.p. 125–129°.
A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is provided with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a calcium chloride exit tube, and a thermometer which reaches nearly to the bottom of the flask. In the flask are placed 181.5 g. (1.5 moles) of allyl bromide and 250 cc. of dry carbon tetrachloride. In the dropping funnel is placed 255 g. (80 cc., 1.56 moles) of bromine which has been washed once with an equal volume of concentrated sulfuric acid. The mechanical agitation is started and the flask is cooled in a mixture of ice and salt. When the temperature has fallen to −5°, the bromine is allowed to drop in slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains at about − 5° and never rises above 0°. The addition of the bromine requires about one and one-half hours. The solution is usually orange-red in color at the end of the reaction, owing to the slight excess of bromine. It is allowed to warm up to room temperature with continuous stirring (about one-half hour) and is then transferred to a large separatory funnel. The flask is washed once with a 10–15 cc. portion of carbon tetrachloride.
B. (Phenylthio)nitromethane. Freshly cut sodium metal (4.8 g) is added to absolute ethanol (100 mL) in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask with a ground-glass joint and allowed to react until the metal is completely consumed. To this mixture is added a solution of nitromethane (12 g) in absolute ethanol (100 mL) with swirling. The phenylsulfenyl chloride (prepared earlier) is quickly poured into a 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a nitrogen inlet/outlet adapter, and a calcium chloride drying tube, and is diluted with dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (250 mL). Stirring is begun, the drying tube is removed, and the sodium nitromethane–ethanol slurry is added quickly in one portion to the THF solution. The deep-red solution immediately turns yellow and stirring is continued for a further 10 min. The reaction mixture consists of solid and liquid. It is dissolved in 200 mL of a 1 N sodium hydroxide solution and poured into a 1000-mL separatory funnel. Dichloromethane (200 mL) is added, the aqueous layer (lower layer) is separated, and the organic layer further extracted with 1 N sodium hydroxide (2 × 100 mL). The combined aqueous layers are washed with dichloromethane (500 mL) and acidified to pH 3 using 1 N hydrochloric acid. The brown organic layer that appears is separated, diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at water aspirator pressure to give 18–19 g (60–65%) of crude (phenylthio)nitromethane as an orange-red oil. This material is of sufficient purity for many purposes. Further purification may be effected by distilling at reduced pressure to give (phenylthio)nitromethane (14 g, 50%) as a pale-yellow oil, bp 85–95°C at 0.05 mm,(Note 12),(Note 13),(Note 14).
Phenylsulfur trifluoride2 (16.6 g., 0.10 mole) is placed in a two-necked 50-ml. flask equipped with a dropping funnel and connected to a dry distillation column. The flask is heated to 50–70° in an oil bath, and 10.6 g. (0.10 mole) of benzaldehyde is added in small portions over 30 minutes. A mild exothermic reaction occurs. After the addition is completed, the reaction flask is heated to 100° with an oil bath, and the pressure on the column is reduced until α,α-difluorotoluene distills. The major portion of product distills at 68° (80 mm.), but a small final cut, b.p. 45° (15 mm.), is obtained. The yield of α,α-difluorotoluene is 9.2–10.2 g. (71–80%). The pressure is reduced and the distillation is continued. An intermediate cut of 1–2 g., b.p. 45° (15 mm.) to 60° (2.5 mm.), is discarded, and benzenesulfinyl fluoride, 11.7–13.2 g. (81–91%), b.p. 60° (2.5 mm.), is collected. Since the benzenesulfinyl fluoride slowly attacks glass and may be unstable to storage at room temperature, it is recommended that this product be stored at −80°.
If necessary, the naphthalene can be removed by sublimation in small batches. Thus, 1.7 g of the naphthalene-silole mixture is ground into powder using a mortar and pestle, and sublimed in the dark, under vacuum (1.5 mmHg) for 3-4 hours at 35 °C. This will typically remove 99% of the naphthalene according to 1H NMR analysis. If desired, further purification can be accomplished by dissolving the residual material from the combined sublimations in hot hexanes (160 mL) followed by cooling in a freezer for 16 h. The pure 2,5-dibromosilole crystallizes as white needles, which are vacuum-filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice cold hexanes and dried in vacuo to afford 6.64 g (95% yield) of 2.. Dibromosilole 2 stored in the dark at room temperature is stable for several weeks. Even brief exposure to sunlight during processing will lead to significant decomposition.
The alcoholic filtrate is evaporated to 50 cc., and 50 g. of barium hydroxide and 150 cc. of distilled water are added. The mixture is refluxed for two hours and the excess barium hydroxide is precipitated with carbon dioxide. The barium carbonate is removed by filtration and washed with hot distilled water. A slight excess of sulfuric acid is added to the filtrate to liberate the amino acid from its barium salt, and an excess of barium carbonate is added to remove sulfate ion. The mixture is digested on the steam bath until effervescence ceases, and then it is filtered and the precipitate is washed with hot distilled water. The filtrate and washings are concentrated on the steam bath to a volume of 100 cc., decolorized with 1 g. of active carbon, filtered, and concentrated to the point of crystallization (about 25 cc.). The amino acid is precipitated by the addition of 150 cc. of absolute alcohol, and the product is collected and washed with absolute alcohol.
B. t-Butyl carbazate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask set up in a hood and fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 500 g. (3.47 moles) of t-butyl S-methylthiolcarbonate and 186 g. (3.71 moles) of 64% hydrazine solution. The contents of the flask are heated in an oil bath at 105–110° (external temperature) with mechanical stirring for 24 hours under a reflux condenser. The resulting mixture is diluted with 650 ml. of methylene dichloride, and anhydrous magnesium sulfate is added until the aqueous layer becomes nearly solid and nonflowing. The upper layer is decanted and dried over fresh anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent removed by distillation from a water bath, the last portions being removed with the aid of a water aspirator. The residual liquid solidifies on cooling and stirring to give 322–385 g. (72–86%) of a snow-white solid, m.p. 37–40°. This product is pure enough for most purposes but can be purified by distillation, a 1-l. Claisen flask with a water or oil bath at 80° being used. After 1 or 2 drops of fore-run the carbazate is collected at 55–57° (0.4 mm.). The oil solidifies on cooling to give 312–358 g. (70–80%) of snow-white crystalline solid, m.p. 40–42°.
When the sodium has dissolved, 2 l. of water is added and the mixture is cooled to 15°. The upper oily layer is then separated, washed with 50 cc. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid and then with 50 cc. of water, dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled with a fractionating column. After a small fore-run of low-boiling liquid, the pure heptanol distils at 155–157.5°. The yield is 145–150 g. (62–65 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 125-ml. dropping funnel are placed 100 g. (0.68 mole) of pure, redistilled benzalacetone1 and 300 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The reaction flask is immersed in an ice-water bath to maintain the reaction mixture between 10° and 20°. With stirring, a cooled solution of 109.5 g. (34.2 ml., 0.68 mole) of bromine in 60 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is run through the dropping funnel as rapidly as the color is destroyed. During this addition the reaction flask should be shielded from direct sunlight.
The reaction mixture is allowed to cool somewhat (to about 40°) and is filtered with suction in order to remove the mechanical impurities which have come from the technical arsenious oxide and sodium hydroxide. The filtrate consists of a clear water solution with a pale yellow oil underneath. It is better not to allow the reaction mixture to cool completely before filtering or else a precipitate of sodium arsenate will gradually separate and this will tend to make an emulsion of the methylene iodide and hinder filtration and separation. The methylene iodide is now separated from the filtrate, dried with a little calcium chloride, and then distilled under reduced pressure. Practically all of it comes over as a light straw-colored oil between 106° and 107°/70 mm., the bath being kept at 130–135°. The yield of crude product is 610–660 g. (90–97 per cent of the theoretical amount). On redistillation not more than 10–20 g. is lost. The crude product is quite satisfactory for most purposes.
After all the quinone has been added, the solution is allowed to stand. It should be watched closely at first to see that the temperature does not rise above 50°, but at the same time it is well not to cool it below 40°. When the mixture starts to cool of its own accord, a precipitate begins to form. As soon as the mixture has cooled to about 25°, it is poured into 750 cc. of cold water, whereupon a white precipitate separates. The mixture is cooled to about 10° and filtered with suction. The product is recrystallized from 250 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and dried. The drying is best done in a vacuum desiccator, through which a very small stream of air is allowed to sweep. Calcium chloride is the best drying agent.
A. 2,6-Dimethylphenyl propanoate. To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is added 26.4 g (0.55 mol) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil. The sodium hydride is washed several times by decantation with dry hexane and is then covered with 1 L of dry ether. The flask is immersed in an ice bath and equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser. A solution of 61.1 g (0.50 mol) of 2,6-dimethylphenol in 150 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over a 10-min period and the mixture is stirred for 5 min, during which time hydrogen evolution ceases. The cold solution is stirred continuously while a solution of 48 mL (50.9 g, 0.55 mol) of propanoyl chloride in 100 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over a 30-min period. After stirring for an additional hour the reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 200 mL of water. The mixture is shaken vigorously and the ether layer is separated and washed successively with 200 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide, 200 mL of water, and 200 mL of 4% hydrochloric acid, then dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator and the residue distilled through a short, indented Claisen apparatus to obtain 85–86 g (96–97%) of 2,6-dimethylphenyl propanoate, bp 60–65°C (0.05 mm).
In a 4-l. wide-mouthed glass jar, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed a solution of 150 g. (3 moles) of sodium cyanide in 500 cc. of water and 318 g. (3 moles) of u.s.p. benzaldehyde. The stirrer is started, and 850 cc. of a saturated solution of sodium bisulfite is added to the mixture, slowly at first and then in a thin stream. The time of addition is ten to fifteen minutes. During the addition of the first half of this solution, 900 g. of cracked ice is added to the reaction mixture, a handful at a time. The layer of mandelonitrile which appears during the addition of the sulfite solution is separated from the water in a separatory funnel. The water is extracted once with about 150 cc. of benzene, the benzene is evaporated, and the residual mandelonitrile is added to the main portion.
The distillate, containing 2-cyclopentenone, water and varying amounts of cyclopentenediols, is dissolved in 150 ml. of methylene chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is carefully removed through a Vigreux column and the residue purified by distillation. After a forerun (b.p. 50–150°), there is collected 44–49 g. (53–60%) of pure 2-cyclopentenone, b.p. 151–154°. Cyclopentenediols may be recovered from the pot residue by distillation at 0.1 mm. The forerun contains appreciable amounts of cyclopentenone and should be added to a succeeding preparation before final distillation.
A mixture of 250 cc. of water and 1 kg. (807 cc., 12.4 moles) of pure ethylene chlorohydrin (b.p. 126–127°) is then added, the stirring is started, and the temperature of the mixture raised to 45° by external application of warm water. At this point the warm water is rapidly removed and the temperature of the contents of the flask carefully held at 45° by jacketing with water at a suitable temperature (33–35°). After the mixture has been held at 45° for one hour it is allowed to warm up to 48° by allowing the temperature of the water bath to rise about 2°. After an hour at 48° the temperature is raised to 50° and held at this point until the reaction is over; it is necessary to raise the temperature of the bath gradually, and the end of the reaction is noted when the bath temperature reaches 50°. A period of four and one-half to five hours is necessary for this last stage.
B. N-Methylthiopyrrolidone (2). A 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber septum, thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and reflux condenser equipped with a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is charged with 19.8 g (19.3 mL, 0.20 mol) of N-methylpyrrolidone and 40.4 g (0.10 mol) of 1, whereupon the temperature of the reaction mixture increases to 75–80°C. After 5 min, 35 mL of benzene is added by syringe and the mixture is stirred while being brought to reflux. The mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr and then cooled to room temperature, whereupon it again becomes heterogeneous. The benzene is removed with the aid of a rotary evaporator and the resulting yellow slurry is distilled under reduced pressure through a 5-cm Vigreux column to provide 23.0 g (100%) of N-methylthiopyrrolidone (2) as a yellow liquid, bp 94–97°C/0.03 mm.
B. Asymmetric hydrogenation. A stainless steel stirred autoclave with a total volume of 500 mL is charged with 25.6 g (0.2 mol) of ketopantoyl lactone,(Note 7),(Note 8),(Note 9). The autoclave is flushed with argon and the catalyst solution (see above) is added by cannula, under argon. The autoclave is sealed and hydrogenation is carried out at 40°C, 750-psig hydrogen and 950–1050 rpm for 48 hr. Care should be taken to flush all the lines before connecting to the autoclave. After the autoclave is cooled to room temperature, it is vented and opened. The reaction mixture is then transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask and most of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporator. Distillation of this reddish solid affords 24–25.6 g (92–98%) of D-(−)-pantoyl lactone: bp 90–110°C (4 cm); [α]D25 −39.3° to −42.4° (c 2, H2O) (78 to 84% e.e.) and.
A. Dipotassium salt of nitroacetic acid. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a fresh solution of 224 g. of potassium hydroxide in 112 g. of water. From the dropping funnel is added, over 30 minutes, 61 g. (1.0 mole) of nitromethane. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 1 hour in an oil bath maintained at approximately 160°. After cooling to room temperature, the precipitated crystalline product is filtered, washed several times with methanol, and dried in a vacuum desiccator under reduced pressure, yielding 71.5–80.0 g. (79–88%) of the dipotassium salt of nitroacetic acid, m.p. 262° (dec.).
A. 2-Nitroso-5-nitrotoluene. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer is placed 50 g. (0.33 mole) of pulverized 5-nitro-2-aminotoluene. To this is added an ice-cold solution of 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 50 ml. of water. While the suspension is stirred at room temperature, a solution of Caro's acid is prepared, as follows: to 175 ml. of ice-cold sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in a 2-l. beaker is added 300 g. (1.11 moles) of pulverized potassium persulfate. The mixture is thoroughly stirred with a glass rod, and to it is added 900 g. of crushed ice and 300 ml. of water.
B. Diethyl [(phenylthio)methyl]phosphonate . As described in ref. 4, a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a warm water (ca. 40-60°C) reflux condenser connected to an empty safety bottle and a safety bottle charged with ethanol, a 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 116.0 g (0.7 mol) of triethyl phosphite. The dropping funnel is charged with 55.5 g (0.35 mol) of chloromethyl phenyl sulfide and the flask is heated under stirring to 130°C (internal temperature). The chloromethyl phenyl sulfide is added slowly at a constant rate over 40 min and the internal temperature is allowed to rise to 150-160°C. After complete addition, the resulting reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 12 hr under reflux and then cooled to room temperature. Excess triethyl phosphite is removed under reduced pressure (11 mm) through a short path distillation apparatus. The crude product is purified by fractional distillation under reduced pressure using a Vigreux column (20 cm) to afford 82.2 g (91%) of diethyl [(phenylthio)methyl]phosphonate as a colorless liquid, bp 130-135°C (0.08 mm).
A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser provided with a gas-outlet connected to a gas-bubbler, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stirrer. After being charged with 400 ml. of pure, dry pentane and 41 g. (0.50 mole) of 1-hexyne, the flask is flushed with nitrogen and immersed in a cold bath, and the contents are stirred. The nitrogen atmosphere is maintained, and a solution of n-butyllithium in hexane or pentane (500 ml. of a 2.5 N solution, or 1.25 mole) is transferred to the flask with a 100-ml. syringe or a cannula. The mixture is allowed to warm to 10° and stirred for 30 minutes, until the initially formed precipitate has completely dissolved.
A dry, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, a 125-ml. pressure equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet tube. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and 15.4 g. (0.100 mole) of geraniol, 35 ml. of dry hexamethylphosphoric triamide, 100 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, and 50 mg. of triphenylmethane are placed in the flask. The stirred solution is cooled to 0° with an ice bath, and 63 ml. (0.1 mole) of 1.6 M methyllithium in ether is injected into the addition funnel. The methyllithium solution is added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. After the addition is complete, the funnel is rinsed by injecting 5 ml. of dry ether.
The contents of the receiver and trap are combined with the aid of a few drops of dichloromethane and distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure. After only a few drops of forerun, 2.87–3.17 g. (60–66%) of 5-hexynal, b.p. 61–62° (30 mm.), nD20 1.4447, d420 0.875,(Note 12),(Note 13), is collected. GC analysis shows this material to contain 3–5% of unidentified impurities with longer retention times.
A. Zinc-copper couple. In a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer are placed 49.2 g. (0.75 g. atom) of zinc powder and 40 ml. of 3% hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred rapidly for 1 minute, then the supernatant liquid is decanted. In a similar manner, the zinc powder is washed successively with three additional 40-ml. portions of 3% hydrochloric acid, five 100-ml. portions of distilled water, two 75-ml. portions of 2% aqueous copper sulfate solution, five 100-ml. portions of distilled water, four 100-ml. portions of absolute ethanol, and five 100-ml. portions of absolute ether. The couple is finally transferred to a Büchner funnel, washed with additional anhydrous ether, covered tightly with a rubber dam, and suction-dried until it reaches room temperature. The zinc-copper couple is stored overnight in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide and is then ready for use in the preparation of norcarane.
The black reaction mixture is diluted with about 100 ml. of diethyl ether and poured onto 200 g. of ether-wet alumina (Woelm, Activity Grade 1) in a 45 × 2.5 cm. glass chromatographic column. The product is washed through the alumina with about 1 l. of ether. The brown eluate is concentrated by distilling the ether through a 45-cm. Vigreux column on a steam bath at atmospheric pressure. When the ether has been distilled, a slight vacuum is applied, removing most of the acetonitrile. After the volume reaches about 50 ml., the mixture is filtered into a 100-ml. distillation flask, removing some precipitated palladium metal. The flask is rinsed with 10-ml. of ether, and the rinse is combined with the product. The flask is equipped with a 10 cm. Vigreux column for distillation at reduced pressure. After removal of the solvent, 8.1–8.5 g. (55–58%) of 2-methyl-3-phenylpropionaldehyde is collected, b.p. 75–85° (3 mm.), n25D 1.5113.
Concentrated sulfuric acid (195 ml.) is placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask immersed in an ice-salt bath and fitted with a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer. Ethyl α-phenoxyacetoacetate (195 g.) is added with stirring through the dropping funnel while the temperature within the flask is maintained below 5°. About 1 hour is required for the addition. The mixture, which solidifies soon after all the ester has been added, is allowed to stand in the ice bath for 1 hour longer. Ice (500 g.) and water (500 ml.) are added with stirring and external cooling. The mixture is then extracted with two 250-ml. portions of benzene. The combined extracts are washed with 100 ml. of water, then with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium bi-carbonate solution, and finally are dried superficially by filtration through a layer of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is distilled from the dried extracts, and the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask fitted with a short air condenser. The pale-yellow oil boils at 162–167°/16 mm. and solidifies on cooling. The product is triturated with a little petroleum ether (b.p. 35–60°) and dried at room temperature. The almost colorless rhombic plates, melting at 49–51°, weigh 60–75 g. (34–42%).
A 200-ml. two-necked flask is fitted with an efficient Dry Ice-isopropyl alcohol condenser connected to a soda-lime tube, a magnetic stirrer, and a gas inlet tube. Isopropyl alcohol and Dry Ice are added to the condenser while the flask and condenser are flushed with dry nitrogen. The flask is immersed in a Dry Ice-isopropyl alcohol bath, and a vigorous stream of dry ammonia is introduced into the system. When about 80 ml. of liquid ammonia is condensed, the gas inlet tube is replaced with a ground-glass stopper. The cooling bath is removed, stirring is started, and 5.1 g. (0.020 mole) of 1,2-bis(n-butylthio) benzene is quickly introduced.
A. (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2). A tared 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with a 31 wt% solution of methylamine in ethanol (112 mL, 85 g, 0.85 mol, 3.0 equiv) and placed in a room temperature water bath. To the stirred solution is added L-alanine methyl ester hydrochloride (40.0 g, 0.287 mol, 1.0 equiv) via a powder funnel followed by a rinse with ethanol (10 mL). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe. The mixture is stirred at 20-22 °C for 4 h. The stir bar is removed, and the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mm Hg, 45 °C bath temperature) to provide a wet solid (60 g). Toluene (100 mL) is added to the mixture, which is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mm Hg, 45 °C bath temperature) to provide a wet solid (65 g). The toluene (100 mL) flush is repeated, and the mixture is concentrated to 49 g of solids, which are dried in a vacuum oven (20 mmHg, 45 °C) for 4 h to afford the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 as a pasty solid (45 g).
C. Active magnesium. A 200-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, stopper, rubber septum, and condenser connected to an argon inlet is charged with 1.5 g. (0.038 g.-atom) of freshly cut potassium,, and, 2.01 g. (0.0211 mole) of anhydrous magnesium chloride, 3.55 g. (0.0214 mole) of anhydrous potassium iodide, and 50 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated to reflux with an electric heating mantle. A black precipitate starts to form within a few minutes. After 3 hours at reflux temperature, the reduction should be complete, producing active magnesium as a black powder that settles very slowly when the stirring is stopped.
The upper layer of di-n-butylcarbinol is separated and allowed to stand over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate for one hour. The liquid is decanted into a 500-cc. Claisen flask, and the residual potassium carbonate is washed with three 10-cc. portions of dry ether, which are added to the material in the distilling flask. After removing a small fraction of low-boiling material, there is obtained 90–92 g. (83–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of pure di-n-butylcarbinol, b.p. 97–98°/ 20 mm..
With vigorous stirring, 100 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel at such a rate that rapid refluxing occurs. Following this, a cold solution of 85 g. (46 cc., 0.85 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 400 cc. of water is added. After the addition of the acid, the two layers become practically clear. A large part of the ethereal layer is decanted into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the remainder, together with the aqueous layer, is transferred to a separatory funnel. The solid remaining in the flask is washed with two 25-cc. portions of ether, which are added to the material in the separatory funnel. The ethereal layer is separated and combined with the decanted portion. The flask is fitted with an efficient fractionating column, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath until the temperature of the vapor reaches about 50°. To the residual impure carbinol is added 75 cc. of 15 per cent aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is boiled vigorously under reflux for three hours, after which the purified carbinol is removed by steam distillation, the volume in the flask being kept at 250–300 cc. The distillate is collected in a separatory funnel so that the lower aqueous layer can be drawn off periodically. The distillation is complete when about 1.5 l. of water has been collected.
A. Disodium dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead stirrer, thermometer, and a 500-mL addition funnel. Sodium hydroxide (320 g, 8 mol) and 500 mL of water are added. Ethyl diazoacetate (200 g, 1.75 mol,) is placed in the addition funnel and added dropwise to the stirred sodium hydroxide solution so as to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture between 60°C and 80°C (approximately 1.5 hr,). After the reaction slurry is cooled to room temperature, it is poured into 2 L of 95% ethanol, mixed well, and the liquid is decanted. This washing procedure is repeated five times using 1.5 L of 95% ethanol each time. The precipitate is collected by filtration using a Büchner funnel, the collected solid is washed with 1 L of absolute ethanol and 1 L of ether, and dried (12 hr) in the air to afford 160–184 g (85–97%) of disodium dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate as yellow brown solid.
At this time the reaction vessel is removed from the oil bath, and stirring of the mixture is continued at ambient temperature for 90 min until the solution cools to an internal temperature of 25-30 °C. A 0.1 N HCl/EtOH solution (6.0 mL) is added in a single portion via syringe, and the red-brown homogeneous reaction solution is stirred at ambient temperature (30 min) until hydrolysis of the initial [5+2] cycloadduct 1 to ketone 2 is complete (as determined by TLC analysis). The solution is then transferred to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. Two portions (75 mL each) of diethyl ether are used to rinse the reaction vessel and are combined with the transferred reaction solution. Silica gel (30 g) is added, and the resulting slurry is concentrated in vacuo by rotary evaporation until the apricot-colored dry silica flows freely in the flask.
After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 15 minutes at 35°. The dropping funnel is removed, 74.5 g. (0.56 mole) of nitronium tetrafluoroborate is added, and the opening of the flask is closed with a glass stopper. The well-stirred reaction mixture is heated by an electric heating mantle to 100° in 15 minutes and kept at 100–115° for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature with continued stirring and is then poured into 800 g. of ice water. Crude 3,5-dinitro-o-tolunitrile separates on top of the aqueous mixture as a dark oil that solidifies after standing a few minutes. The solid is collected on a Buchner funnel. It is triturated on the funnel with five 50-ml. portions of cold water and with 40 ml. of ice-cold ethanol. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator, the crude nitrile weighs 75–84 g., m.p. 60–65°. Recrystallization from about 110 ml. of hot methanol gives 50–55 g. (48–53%) of 3,5-dinitro-o-tolunitrile, m.p. 82–84°.
A solution of 1100 g. of sodium hydroxide (two and one-half to three times the amount theoretically necessary to liberate the free amine) in 2 l. of water is allowed to drop through the separatory funnel into the reaction mixture, which has cooled somewhat during the change of apparatus. The amine distils, passes through the condenser, through the intermediate bottle, and into the receiver, in which is placed an amount of concentrated hydrochloric acid (930 cc. of sp. gr. 1.19) slightly more than enough to neutralize the weight of amine which should theoretically be formed. To be certain that all the amine has been driven from the reaction flask, heat is finally applied for ten or fifteen minutes to the mixture. The whole procedure, from the beginning of the first reaction until a solution of trimethylamine hydrochloride is obtained, requires not more than six to seven hours.
In a 500-cc. separatory funnel are placed 74 g. (95 cc., 1 mole) of tert.-butyl alcohol and 247 cc. (3 moles) of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). After shaking, the layers are allowed to separate (fifteen to twenty minutes) and the upper layer is drawn off and washed first with a 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, then with water until neutral to moist litmus paper and. The chloride is treated with 10 g. of calcium chloride and shaken thoroughly, then transferred to a 125-cc. distilling flask. It is then distilled, using a long water condenser. The fraction boiling at 49.5–52° weighs 72–82 g. (78–88 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The hot filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask and cooled overnight by a stream of cold water. The mixture is filtered, and the crystals are pressed nearly dry. The solid is dissolved in 1.5 l. of boiling water, and the solution is acidified with glacial acetic acid (about 100 ml. is required,). The solution is heated with 10 g. of Norit, filtered hot, and cooled to 20°. The brown crystals are collected and dried for several hours in an oven at 65° or in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of 2-amino-4-nitrophenol melting at 140–142° is 160–167 g. (64–67%). If a purer product is desired, the crude substance is recrystallized from 1.5 l. of hot water; 147–153 g. (58–61%) of material melting at 142–143° is obtained.
Sufficient concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 8 cc.) is added to neutralize the mixture, and then an additional 4 cc. After refluxing for five minutes, 160 cc. of cold water is added, and the flask is cooled by ice water. The cooling and rapid stirring induce the formation of small crystals which are separated by filtration and washed once with 50 cc. of cold 50 per cent methyl alcohol and then with water until free of acid. The yield of crude, air-dried, dibenzoylmethane is 83–89 g. (74–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude product is very pure but, if desired, may be recrystallized from 150 cc. of hot methyl alcohol. The first crop, obtained by cooling to 0°, weighs 74–80 g. (66–71 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 77–78°. Partial evaporation of the solvent yields 3–5 g. of less pure product.
A fresh drying tube is attached to the reflux condenser, the cooling water is turned on, and to the warm solution is added 65.2 g. (0.4 mole) of bromocyclohexane during approximately 20 minutes. The reaction is vigorous and may require cooling. Refluxing is continued by heating the mixture in an oil bath for 2 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled and washed with 300 ml. of water. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined benzene and toluene solutions are washed with two 50-ml. portions of water and distilled from a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The yield of α-cyclohexylphenylacetonitrile boiling at 174–176°/13 mm. is 45–53 g. (65–77%); the distillate solidifies to a crystalline mass which has a melting point of 50–53.5°. The nitrile can be recrystallized from commercial pentane with approximately 15% loss; it then melts at 56–58°.
A. 3-Methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride. A 2-l. stainless steel autoclave equipped with stirrer, pressure gauge, and thermocouple is charged with 500 g. (5.1 moles) of maleic anhydride, 645 ml. of benzene, and 0.25 g. of hydroquinone. The autoclave is closed, cooled to −70° with stirring, and evacuated to a pressure of about 20 mm. Allene3 (100 g., 2.5 moles) is sucked into the autoclave, and the mixture is heated with stirring for 8–10 hours at 200–210°. During this time, the pressure drops from 23 atm. to 15 atm. The vessel is cooled to 25°, and unreacted allene (6–13 g.) is vented into a cold trap. The benzene solution is decanted, and about 500 ml. of acetone is added to the autoclave and stirred until the dark viscous residue goes into solution. The benzene and acetone solutions are combined, filtered, and distilled through a 19-mm. × 1.8-m. Nester spinning-band still.4 When the pot temperature reaches 170°, the pressure is reduced to 40 mm., and up to 250 g. of maleic anhydride, b.p. 110–115°/40 mm., is recovered. Finally 119 g. of crude anhydride mixture, b.p. 70–125°/3 mm., is collected.
A. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)pyrrolidine. A 500-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with magnetic stirring bar, is charged with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (120 mL) and pyrrolidine (11.3 mL, 133 mmol). The flask is fitted with a 60-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel vented through a mineral oil bubbler and charged with a solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (24.6 g, 112 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (35 mL) . After the pyrrolidine solution is cooled to 0°C in ice, the colorless dicarbonate solution is added dropwise over a period of 30 min, and the resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 3 hr. The solvents are then removed under reduced pressure, and two consecutive Kugelrohr distillations of the residual oil (oven temperature 80°C at 0.2 mm) afford 16.6 g (87%) of N-Boc-pyrrolidine as a colorless oil.
In a 500-mL, three-necked Morton flask fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, and gas inlet tube is placed 8.6 g (0.375 g-atom) of sodium and 75 mL of dry xylene; the unstirred mixture is heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere. After the xylene has reached its boiling point and the sodium has melted, the solution is rapidly stirred to produce a very fine-grained sodium sand. Quickly the heating mantle is removed and stirring stopped. After cooling, the xylene is pipetted or siphoned away from the sodium sand and stored for future use.
Dehydration of the monohydrate is initiated by suspending the crystalline solid (62.8 g) in 1.2 L of dichloromethane ; the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously for 1 hr to break up any large lumps of solid. After 1 hr of vigorous stirring, 60 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate is added to the fine dispersion. After the suspension is stirred for 10 min, it becomes translucent. At this point the mixture is filtered through 40 g of Celite in a 10 cm-i.d. Büchner funnel fitted with a Whatman #1 filter paper. The clear, colorless filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The oily residue is dissolved in 200 mL of toluene , and the resulting solution is concentrated to remove any residual dichloromethane. The oily concentrate is then dissolved in 175 mL of hot (60°C) toluene , and the resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23°C. Crystallization of the product may occur spontaneously within 1-3 hr at 23°C; however, if necessary, it can be initiated by scratching the side of the flask until crystals are observed. Once crystallization is initiated, the crystals are broken up periodically with a spatula to obtain a fine powder that is easily manipulated. After 30 min from the onset of crystallization, the flask is cooled to −20°C under an argon atmosphere to complete the crystallization process. After standing at −20°C for 2 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 200 mL of ether . The product is dried by transferring the solid to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum adapter and evacuating the flask (0.5 mm). After 1 hr at 23°C, the flask is immersed in an oil bath at 60°C. After 12 hr, the flask is cooled to 23°C to afford 53.8 g (67% overall) of anhydrous (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide.
B. (endo,endo)-9-Thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diol (2). To a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is added 21.12 g (0.10 mol) of the dichloride (1), 100 mL of acetone, and a solution of 34.33 g (0.12 mol) of sodium carbonate decahydrate in 200 mL of water. A condenser is attached to the flask, the contents are stirred gently and then heated to reflux. After 1 hr at reflux (bath temperature ca. 85°C) the clear solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and the stirrer bar is removed. Solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator until the aqueous slurry of white solid is reduced to roughly 25 mL and then the solid is removed by suction filtration at room temperature. The dried, crude diol is heated with 300 mL of methanol and the hot solution filtered directly into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, thereby removing small quantities of solid impurity. A rotary evaporator is used to concentrate the solution to a volume of ca. 40 mL, and the resulting slurry is filtered to yield 15.2–16.2 g (87–93%) of (endo,endo)-9-thiabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane-2,6-diol (2) as a white solid,.
A. Tetrahydropyranyl derivative of propargyl alcohol [tetrahydro-2-(2-propynyloxy)-2H-pyran]. Two crystals (ca. 10 mg) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added to 268 g (291.3 mL, 3.2 mol) of warm (60°C) dihydropyran in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a dropping funnel containing 168 g (174.5 mL, 3.0 mol) of propargyl alcohol and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube. Stirring is started, and the propargyl alcohol is added as a thin stream during a period of ca. 30 min. The reaction is mildly exothermic, and the temperature is maintained at 60–65°C by controlling the rate of addition of the propargyl alcohol and by occasional external cooling with an ice bath. After the addition is completed, the temperature is monitored for another 30 min; slight cooling is sometimes necessary to keep the temperature in the range of 60–65°C. The reaction mixture is stirred for a total of 1.5 hr after the addition is completed, and then 0.5 g of powdered sodium bicarbonate is added and the mixture stirred for another hour. The mixture is then gravity-filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. The reaction mixture is distilled through a 45-cm Vigreux column under reduced pressure. A small forerun (ca. 40 mL) with a bp of 45°C (15–20 mm) is followed by the product, bp 47–50°C (3.5–5 mm), 330–355 g (78–92%); n22D 1.4559; 1H NMR (90 MHz, neat) δ: 1.18–1.93 (br m, 6, H2',2'', H3',3'', H4',4''); 2.47 (t, 1, J = 2, C≡C-H), 3.17–3.84 (m, 2, H5',5''), 4.03 (d, 2, J = 2, C≡C-CH2O), 4.63 (s, 1, H1); IR (neat) cm−1: 3300 (C≡C-H), 2117 (C≡C stretch).
The finely powdered mixture of potassium salicylate and carbonate is placed in a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask which is immersed in an oil bath so that only a small portion of the neck protrudes from the bath. The bath is heated to 240° and maintained at this temperature for one and one-half hours. During this time the solid in the flask is stirred occasionally with a curved glass rod flattened at the end.
The isomerized rosin, 245 g. (0.72 mole), is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 375 ml. of acetone by heating the mixture on a steam bath. To this solution, at incipient boiling, is added slowly and with vigorous agitation 127 g. (0.81 mole) of diamylamine2. Upon cooling to room temperature, crystals appear in the form of rosettes. The mass is agitated, cooled well in an ice bath, and filtered by suction. The crystalline salt is washed on a Büchner funnel with 150 ml. of acetone and dried in a vacuum oven at 50° for 1 hour. The optical rotation of this material is [α]D24 −18°. The solid is recrystallized four times from acetone. Each time a sufficient quantity (20 ml. per g.) of acetone is used to obtain complete solution, and the solvent is evaporated until incipient precipitation of the salt occurs. The yield of product is 118 g.; [α]D24 −60°. An additional 29 g. of product, having the same rotation, can be recovered from filtrates of the previous crystallizations.
C. [MoCl3(THF)3](3). A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper and a gas inlet connected to the argon/vacuum line is flame-dried and back-filled with argon. While maintaining a positive argon pressure, the flask is charged with acetonitrile (250 mL). Molybdenum (V) chloride (MoCl5) (51.17 g, 160 mmol) is then added in portions over a period of 20 min, causing a gentle warming of the mixture. The resulting suspension is stirred for 20 h at ambient temperature. The solid material is filtered off and is carefully rinsed with acetonitrile (50 mL) before it is dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) to give MoCl4(MeCN)2 as a red-brown solid (47.5 g, 93%). This material is re-dispersed in THF (200 mL) and the suspension is stirred for 3.5 h under argon. The resulting complex is filtered off under argon, the solid is carefully washed with pentane (100 mL) and dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) to give MoCl4(THF)2 as orange-brownish crystals (53.30 g, 94%).
After the reaction mixture has been refluxed for 15 hours, the stirrer is stopped, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool, and the excess sodium is carefully removed. The apparatus is then assembled as before, but with a 1-l. separatory funnel fitted into the third neck of the flask. The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 85–90°, and with continued stirring, a solution of 95 g. (1.01 moles) of monochloroacetic acid in 800 ml. of warm dry toluene is added from the separatory funnel at such a rate that refluxing is not too vigorous. A heavy precipitate of sodium chloroacetate forms immediately. After all the chloroacetic acid has been added, the mixture is refluxed and stirred for 48 hours. During this period, the stirring must be as thorough as possible; it is necessary to add 1–1.5 l. of dry toluene, and the stirrer must be stopped at frequent intervals while the solid material is removed from the side of the flask.
A 3-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and an efficient reflux condenser is charged with 540 ml. of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide, 257 g. (253 ml., 2.20 moles) of phenylacetonitrile, and 5.0 g. (0.022 mole) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride. Stirring is begun, and 218 g. (150 ml., 2.00 moles) of ethyl bromide is added dropwise over a period of approximately 100 minutes at 28–35°. If necessary, the flask may be cooled with a cold-water bath to keep the temperature of the mixture at 28–35°. After the addition of ethyl bromide is complete, stirring is continued for 2 hours, then the temperature is increased to 40° for an additional 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled to 25°, 21.2 g. (20.3 ml., 0.200 mole) of benzaldehyde is added, and stirring is continued for 1 hour. The flask is immersed in a cold-water bath, and 750 ml. of water and 100 ml. of benzene are added. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 200 ml. of benzene. The organic layers are combined and washed successively with 200 ml. of water, 200 ml. of dilute hydrochloric acid, and 200 ml. of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The product is distilled through a Vigreux column, giving 225–242 g. (78–84%) of 2-phenylbutyronitrile, b.p. 102–104° (7 mm.), nD25 1.5065–1.5066,(Note 7),(Note 8).
A 1-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser, through which a thermometer extends nearly to the bottom of the flask. In the flask are thoroughly mixed 40.5 g. (0.62 g. atom) of zinc dust and 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and to this mixture is added 42.5 g. (0.25 mole) of sebacoin (p.840). The mixture is stirred rapidly, and 90 ml. of concentrated C.P. hydrochloric acid is added dropwise during a period of 5 to 10 minutes, or as fast as control of foaming and temperature permits. The temperature must be kept between 75 and 80°, and cooling by a water bath may be necessary during the addition of the hydrochloric acid. Stirring is continued for 1.5 hours at 75–80°. Thirty minutes after the initial addition of hydrochloric acid, and again 30 minutes later, 90-ml. portions of concentrated hydrochloric acid are added to the mixture while the temperature is maintained at 75–80°. After the reaction is complete, the remaining zinc is separated from the cooled mixture by decantation. The liquid phase is diluted with 700 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether, each of which is first used to wash the residual zinc. The ether extracts are combined and washed with 250 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, three 250-ml. portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution (foaming!), and finally 250 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (about 25 g. is needed). After the drying agent has been removed by filtration and the solvent by distillation, the residue is distilled at reduced pressure through an efficient column. After a small fore-run consisting mostly of cyclodecane, cyclodecanone is collected at 99–101°/8 mm. The yield is 29–30 g. (75–78%), n25D 1.4808–1.4810.
C. 7-Chloro-4-quinolinol and 4,7-dichloroquinoline. The above air-dried acid is suspended in 1 l. of Dowtherm A in a 2-l. flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser. The mixture is boiled for 1 hour under a stream of nitrogen to assist in the removal of the water. The clear, light-brown solution is cooled to room temperature, and 90 ml. (150 g., 0.98 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride is added. The temperature is raised to 135–140°, and the mixture is stirred for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is cooled and poured into a separatory funnel. The portion of the mixture adhering to the flask is rinsed into the funnel with ether, and the solution is washed with three 500-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid. The combined acid extracts are cooled in ice and neutralized with 10% sodium hydroxide to precipitate the 4,7-dichloroquinoline. The solid is collected, washed thoroughly with water, and dried; it weighs 130–145 g. (66–73%) and melts at 80–82°. The pure product is obtained by one recrystallization from Skellysolve B (b.p. 61–70°); weight 110–120 g. (55–60%), m.p. 84–85°.
(A) Preparation of Cuprous Chloride Solution.—A solution of 1250 g. (5 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate and 325 g. (5.6 moles) of sodium chloride in 4 l. of hot water is prepared in a 12-l. flask. The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, and an alkaline solution of sodium sulfite (265 g. of sodium bisulfite and 175 g. of sodium hydroxide in 2 l. of water) is added during a period of five to ten minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and washed by decantation. The cuprous chloride is obtained as a white powder, which, however, darkens on exposure to the air. The crude product is dissolved in 2 kg. of commercial 28 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.14) and the solution is used in the following preparation.
The crude dione (ca. 20 g) is dissolved in dry methanol (MeOH, 40 mL), and the solution is degassed with a stream of dry oxygen-free argon. This solution is transferred via cannula into the flask containing the freshly prepared [RuCl2-(S)-BINAP)]-Et3N catalyst under argon. The resulting suspension is stirred and heated with a hair dryer to dissolve the catalyst. The resulting solution is transferred via cannula under argon pressure into a flame-dried, 250-mL Schlenk flask sealed with a septum and vented with a syringe needle. The septum is replaced with a high-vacuum stopcock and the Schlenk flask is transferred to a nitrogen glove box where the contents are transferred to a 250-mL pressure reaction vessel equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The vessel is sealed. The pressure vessel is then transferred from the glove box to an electrical heating jacket preheated to 70°C and the vessel is pressurized to 1250 psi with hydrogen gas in an explosion proof fume hood. The vessel is heated until the internal temperature is 65°C, and the contents are stirred with a magnetic stirrer at that temperature for 12-14 hr. The vessel is cooled to room temperature and cautiously vented to discharge excess hydrogen gas. The reaction mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure and filtered through a plug of silica gel that is washed with 1:1 ethyl acetate/hexanes (ca. 300 mL). Solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and the crude product is crystallized from a mixture of hexane:dichloromethane (2:3, v/v), and the solid is collected by suction filtration and rinsed with a mixture of hexane:CH2Cl2 (2:3, v/v). The off-white solid is recrystallized from hexane:CH2Cl2 (2:3, v/v), to give three crops of crystals. The combined yield of the white crystalline product is 7.66 g (40%).
C. Methyl 7-oxoöctanoate. The 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 72–78 g. (0.21–0.23 mole) of disodium tetracarbonylferrate from Part A is flushed rapidly with nitrogen while the gas-dispersion tube is removed, a magnetic stirring bar is placed inside, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is attached. The other branch of the three-way stopcock is connected to a bubbler, the dropping funnel is capped with a rubber septum, and 600 ml. of dry, deoxygenated N-methylpyrrolidinone and is added. The suspension is stirred and maintained under a static nitrogen atmosphere as 41.8 g. (0.200 mole) of methyl 6-bromohexanoate is injected into the dropping funnel with a gas-tight syringe and added dropwise into the flask. The resulting solution is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and cooled in an ice bath before 64 g. (28 ml., 0.45 mole) of methyl iodide is added over 20 minutes. The ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 20–40 hours. The dark-red mixture is poured into 3 l. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and extracted with three 400-ml. portions of ether and one 400-ml. portion of hexane. The combined organic solutions are washed with one 400-ml. portion of water and one 400-ml. portion of saturated sodium chloride. After 400 ml. of 2 M hydrochloric acid is added, the iron by-products are oxidized with iron(III) chloride exactly as described in Part B. The ethereal solution is evaporated under reduced pressure, the residual oil is applied to a column of silica gel packed in hexane, and the organic product is separated from the iron by-products by chromatography as described in Part B. The ether–hexane eluate is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent is evaporated, and the remaining liquid is distilled at reduced pressure, giving 24.0–24.8 g. (70–72%) of methyl 7-oxoöctanoate, b.p. 112–127° (10 mm.), n20D 1.4360.
(A) Alcoholysis of Methyleneaminoacetonitrile.—To a solution of 51.5 g. (28 cc., 0.5 mole) of 95 per cent sulfuric acid in 125 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol at 45–50°, contained in a wide-mouthed 250-cc. conical flask, is added 34 g. (0.5 mole) of methyleneaminoacetonitrile (p. 355). The flask is closed with a rubber stopper and vigorously shaken by hand. Solution takes place with evolution of heat, the temperature rising about 10–15°. The liquid separates into two layers, the upper one consisting of methylene diethyl ether; crystallization of the aminoacetonitrile hydrogen sulfate sets in rapidly. The mixture is shaken vigorously at intervals to prevent the formation of a hard cake of crystals. After the mass has stood overnight in the refrigerator at 0–5°, the salt is filtered off and washed with a minimum quantity (20–25 cc.) of ice-cold alcohol. The yield is 57–62 g. (75–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
When the transfer is complete, the syringe is rinsed successively with two 5 mL portions of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran into the reaction mixture. Upon addition of the substrate to the catalyst mixture, the color changed to olive green. The mixture is maintained at 30-32 °C for 22–23 h, when TLC indicated complete consumption of the starting material. The olive green-colored mixture is then passed through a pad of silica gel (5 cm diameter × 5 cm height) and rinsed with diethyl ether (200 mL). The bright yellow filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (150 mmHg, 40 °C). The liquid is then transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask and distilled through a short path apparatus into a receiving flask immersed in an ice water bath to provide 11.5–12.8 g (75.7–84.2 mmol, 85–95% yield) of (S)-2-allyl-2-methylcyclohexanone as a clear, colorless liquid boiling from 91-93 °C/16 mmHg that is analytically pure based on standard techniques. Analysis of this material by GC on a chiral stationary phase found 86–87% enantiomeric excess. In a reaction that gave 85% yield after distillation, additional product was obtained by subjecting the material remaining in the distillation pot to flash chromatography on silica gel, which provided an additional 1.14 g of product (7.50 mmol, 8% yield), also of 86% ee, for a combined yield of 12.64 g (83.2 mmol, 93% yield).
B. Phenanthrene-9,10-oxide (2). A solution of 10.6 g. (0.0500 mole) of 1 and 13 g. of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal in 40 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide and 100 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is heated at reflux for 16 hours. The solution is then allowed to cool to room temperature, and 200 ml. of water and 100 ml. of ether are added. The organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is washed with two 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether phases are dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gives 9.6 g. of a yellow solid. Trituration with 25 ml. of hexane removes colored impurities, and recrystallization from benzene–cyclohexane gives 5.6–6.2 g. (58–64%) of oxide 2 as off-white plates, m.p. 125° (dec.). A second crop of 1.0 g can be obtained, for an overall yield of 68–74%.
B. 3,5-Dinitro-o-tolunitrile. A 500-ml. four-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermometer and an inlet for dry nitrogen. It is baked thoroughly by means of a Bunsen flame and allowed to cool to room temperature with a slow stream of dry nitrogen passing through it. The flask is charge, preferably in a dry box, with 335 g. of tetramethylene sulfone and 73.1 g. (0.55 mole) of nitronium tetrafluoroborate. The thermometer is adjusted so that the bulb is immersed in the liquid. The reaction mixture is stirred well and kept at 10–20° by means of an ice bath while 58.5 g. (0.50 mole) of freshly distilled o-tolunitrile3 is added dropwise. The nitronium tetrafluoroborate only partially dissolves in the tetramethylene sulfone, but through good stirring a homogeneous suspension can be obtained. As the dissolved nitronium salt reacts with the nitrile, more and more salt dissolves until all of it is in solution. The addition of o-tolunitrile requires 25–35 minutes.
In a 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a thermometer in a well is placed a solution of 500 g. (9.7 moles) of powdered 95 per cent sodium cyanide in 1.2 l. of water and 900 cc. (713 g., 12.3 moles) of acetone. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the solution is stirred vigorously. When the temperature falls to 15°, 2.1 l. (8.5 moles) of 40 per cent sulfuric acid is added over a period of three hours, the temperature being kept between 10° and 20°. After all the acid has been added the stirring is continued for fifteen minutes and then the flask is set aside for the salt to settle. Usually a layer of acetone cyanohydrin forms and is decanted and separated from the aqueous layer. The sodium bisulfate is removed by filtration and washed with three 50-cc. portions of acetone. The combined filtrate and acetone washings are added to the aqueous solution, which is then extracted three times with 250-cc. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the cyanohydrin previously separated and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether and acetone are removed by distillation from a water bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The low-boiling portion is discarded, and acetone cyanohydrin is collected at 78–82°/15 mm. The yield is 640–650 g. (77–78 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Tributyl(4-methoxyphenyl)stannane (2). A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and nitrogen gas inlet, is charged with 2.91 g (120 mmol) of magnesium turnings and. The flask is fitted with a rubber septum and charged sequentially via syringe with 85 mL of tetrahydrofuran, 14.0 mL (112 mmol) of 4-bromoanisole, and 0.05 mL of methyl iodide. The rubber septum is immediately replaced with a Teflon stopper. Within 5 min, the reaction spontaneously warms to reflux temperature and continues to boil for approximately 10 min. The reaction is stirred an additional 2 hr without external heating or cooling. The flask is fitted with a rubber septum and 30.5 mL (112 mmol) of tributyltin chloride is added to the green solution via a syringe. The septum is again replaced with a Teflon stopper and the reaction is heated at reflux for 12 hr.
B. 2,4-Dinitrobenzenesulfenyl chloride. Dry 2,4-dinitrophenyl benzyl sulfide (232 g., 0.80 mole) and 400 ml. of dry ethylene chloride are placed in a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer. Sulfuryl chloride (119 g., 0.88 mole) is added to the resulting suspension at room temperature. A mildly exothermic reaction causes the solid to dissolve quickly, usually within 1 to 2 minutes, with a temperature rise of 10–15°. The resulting clear yellow solution is concentrated to an oil by heating under aspirator vacuum on a steam bath. (Caution! Do not heat with gas or electricity because the product, like many nitro compounds, can explode if overheated.) The residual oil is cooled to 50–60°, and 3–4 volumes of dry petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°) are added with vigorous handswirling. The oil quickly crystallizes. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered to separate 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfenyl chloride as a yellow crystalline solid. The sulfenyl chloride is washed well with dry petroleum ether and dried at 60–80°; weight 150–170 g. (80–90%); m.p. 95–96°,.
Twelve grams (0.18 mole) of ground potassium hydroxide is dissolved in 45 ml. of n-propyl alcohol in a three-necked 500-ml. flask set on a steam bath so that the mixture can be warmed. Two necks of the flask are fitted with dropping funnels. A Vigreux fractionating column (25 cm. in length and 12 mm. in diameter) is inserted in the third neck of the flask. The column is connected, through a condenser and adapter, to a filter flask set in ice as the receiver. The side arm of the receiver is fitted with a drying tube. About 1.5 hours is required to dissolve the hydroxide, whereupon an additional amount of alcohol is added to bring the total volume to 50 ml. The solution is then cooled, and 100 ml. of absolute ether is added. Through one dropping funnel is added dropwise 20 ml. of nitrosomethylurethan1 (equivalent to 0.10 mole of diazomethane;). The flask is warmed on a steam bath so that diazomethane distils over with ether while the nitrosomethylurethan is being added. The addition requires about 20 minutes. During this operation more dry ether is added as needed, through the second dropping funnel, until the total volume of ether distillate is 250 ml. When the ether distilling over is colorless, the distillate is transferred to another three-necked 500-ml. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser. To the stirred solution is added, over a period of 15 minutes, a solution of 6.6 ml. (7.7 g., 0.050 mole) of phenylacetyl chloride in 10 ml. of absolute ether. A copious evolution of nitrogen accompanies this operation.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a 250-cc. dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a calcium chloride tube, are placed 30 g. (1.25 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings, 50 cc. of dry ether, and a small crystal of iodine. Stirring is started, and 5 cc. (6 g.) of n-amyl bromide is added. As soon as the reaction has started, 300 cc. of dry ether is added and then, more slowly, a solution of 183 g. (total, 189 g.; 1.25 moles) of n-amyl bromide in 150 cc. of dry ether. If external cooling is provided, all the alkyl halide may be added within half an hour; the solution is refluxed gently for another half-hour to complete the reaction. The heat is removed, the flask cooled to 50°, and 148 g. (1 mole) of ethyl orthoformate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 258) is added during the course of fifteen to twenty minutes. The mixture is refluxed for six hours; at the end of this time the condenser is arranged for distillation and the ether is removed completely with the aid of a steam bath.
To the solution is added 900 ml. of water, and the resulting mixture is washed with four 500-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The ether layers are combined, washed with 200 ml. of aqueous 10% potassium carbonate and then twice with 200-ml. portions of water, and dried for 1 hour over 200 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at room temperature, yielding 145–158 g. of crude product. Distillation under reduced pressure through a Vigreux column gives 115–128 g. of a fraction, b.p. 83–86° (54 mm.), n22D 1.4620–1.4640, containing 95% of 1-bromo-3-methyl-2-butanone as established by 1H NMR measurements.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser. A solution of 0.74 g. (0.0067 mole) of selenium dioxide in 150 ml. of tert-butyl alcohol is introduced into the flask, followed by 68 g. (0.50 mole) of β-pinene. The resulting mixture is warmed to 40° with a hot water bath before 35 ml. (0.62 mole) of 50% aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise over 90 minutes, during which time the mixture is maintained at 40–50° by occasional immersion in a cold water bath. After stirring for an additional 2 hours, the reaction mixture is diluted with 50 ml. of benzene, washed with three 50-ml. portions of saturated aqueous ammonium sulfate, and dried over sodium sulfate. A small amount of hydroquinone is added, and the solvents are removed on a rotary evaporator. trans-Pinocarveol is isolated by simple distillation under reduced pressure, yielding 37–42 g. (49–55%), b.p. 60–70° (1 mm.), n22D 1.4972, [α]20D + 53.5 to + 60.0° (c 2.5, methanol).
Potassium (R)-(+)-2,3-epoxypropanoate (Potassium glycidate). The crude acid from the preceding step (74.5 g, 0.44 mol) is dissolved in absolute ethanol (300 mL) and cooled to −20°C. Under N2, a filtered solution of potassium hydroxide (86%, 55.5 g, 0.85 mol) in absolute ethanol (300 mL) is slowly added. After 2 hr, the mixture is allowed to warm to 0°C and stirred at this temperature for 14 hr. The solution is filtered to remove precipitated salts. Half of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation without warming and an additional crop of salt (2-4 g) is isolated by filtration. The combined salts are dried under vacuum to give 105 g of a 1 : 1 mixture of KBr and potassium glycidate .
C. (Z)-β-[2-(N,N-Dimethylamino)phenyl]styrene. A 1-L. three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a 300-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is capped with serum stoppers. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 0.433 g (0.0025 mol) of palladium chloride, 2.62 g (0.010 mol) of triphenylphosphine and 300 mL of benzene. While a continuous positive nitrogen pressure is maintained, the mixture is stirred at gentle reflux for 30 min, and then 4.25 mL (0.0060 mol) of a 1.41 M solution of methyllithium in ether is added with a syringe. After an additional 10 min at reflux, 9.15 g (0.050 mol) of (Z)-β-bromostyrene as prepared in Section A is added in one portion with syringe, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 10 min. The solution of 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyllithium prepared as described in Section B is transferred to the dropping funnel with a syringe and diluted by adding 150 mL of benzene and. The resulting solution is then added dropwise to the mixture with stirring at reflux over a period of 30 min. After additional stirring for 10 min, the resulting red solution is cooled to room temperature with the help of an ice bath and quenched by adding 100 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The organic layer is separated, washed successively with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and then dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is evaporated with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give a forerun (ca. 11 g) of excess N,N-dimethylaniline, bp 31–51°C (1 mm), followed by 7.4–7.5 g (66–67%) of (Z)-β-[2-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl]styrene, bp 90.0–92.0°C (0.035 mm), 82–84°C (0.01 mm), as a pale-yellow liquid.
To purify the durene, 200 g. of the crude product is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and melted in a water bath at 95°; 200 cc. of warm (50°) 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is then added through the top of the condenser, and the mixture is carefully heated until homogeneous. The solution is filtered on a hot-water funnel, allowed to stand tightly covered in a fairly warm place (35°) overnight, cooled to about 0°, and filtered on a suction filter. The product (about 169 g.) melts at 74–78°. A second recrystallization yields 149 g. melting at 77–79°. A third recrystallization yields 140 g. having a melting point of 79–80°. The alcoholic filtrates are fractionated, and the crude durene obtained is worked over with the isomers of durene.
C. Oxidation of 4-amino-3-chlorophenol. When the reduction is complete, the system is disassembled, the catholyte poured into a flask, and the apparatus rinsed with hot water into the same flask. The combined catholyte and washings are extracted with ether in a continuous-type liquid-liquid extractor to remove the acetic acid almost completely. The residual aqueous acid solution of the aminophenol is made up to 4N in sulfuric acid by adding 20 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and diluting with water to 400 ml.
The dried ether can be further purified by treatment with charcoal and recrystallization from a mixture of methylene chloride and light petroleum ether (b.p. 60–68°). This gives 11.3–11.7 g. (41–44% based on o-nitrotoluene) of ethyl indole-2-carboxylate in the form of white needles, m.p. 122.5–124°.
A. 1-(1-Ethoxyethoxy)-1,2-propadiene (1). A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a calcium chloride-filled tube. The flask is charged with 100 g (1.39 mol) of ethyl vinyl ether and 50 mg (0.26 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The mixture is then stirred and cooled in an ice-salt bath while 56.1 g (1.00 mol) of propargyl alcohol is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 50 min; the rate of addition adjusted to maintain the temperature between 5°C and 10°C. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 15 min and then quenched by adding of 3 mL of a aqueous saturated solution of potassium carbonate (K2CO3). The resulting mixture is dried over K2CO3, filtered, and excess ethyl vinyl ether is removed at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator at temperatures below 25°C. Distillation of the residual liquid under reduced pressure affords 106 - 117 g (88 - 92%) of 3-(1-ethoxyethoxy)-1-propyne as a colorless clear oil, bp 37-41°C/11 mm.
Benzoyl chloride (281 g., 2.0 moles) is placed in the reaction vessel, and the hydrogen fluoride gas is then introduced by its distillation from the transfer bottle through the inlet tube. Prior to this distillation the hypodermic needle is closed off by a metal cap. The hydrogen fluoride is added over a period of approximately 1 hour. Generally, external cooling is not needed, as the evaporating hydrogen chloride cools the reaction mixture. When the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is warmed to 30–40° and kept at this temperature for 1 hour. The mixture is then washed in an ordinary glass separatory funnel with 500 ml. of ice water in which 12.5 g. (0.2 mole) of boric acid is dissolved. The organic layer is quickly separated, and to it are added 10 g. of anhydrous sodium fluoride and 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The mixture is allowed to stand for 30 minutes and is then filtered and distilled through a short Vigreux column. The yield of benzoyl fluoride b.p. 159–161°, n15D 1.4988, is 187–200 g. (75–80%).
Once cooled, 160 mL of toluene is added via syringe, followed by chlorotris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) (30.8 g, 34.8 mmol) and diphenylacetylene (14.2 g, 80 mmol) by temporarily removing a rubber septum. The resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 5 h before cooling to room temperature, transferring to a single-neck flask, and concentrating under reduced pressure. The residue is suspended in hexanes (150 mL) and filtered through a Büchner funnel. The solids are washed with hexanes (~3.5 L) until the filtrate is colorless. The resultant dark mustard-colored filter cake is dissolved from the filter into a new collection flask with methylene chloride. Washing is continued until the filtrate is colorless. A black insoluble solid is left after washing and is discarded. The organic solution is concentrated in vacuo to provide 12.7 g (23.6 mmol, 67%) of (η5-carbomethoxycyclopentadienyl)-(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt as a mustard-colored solid.
A 250-cc. flask, fitted with an inlet tube reaching to the bottom, a thermometer, and an exit tube for conducting away unused gas, is immersed in an ice-water bath, and to it is added 80 g. (0.69 mole) of freshly distilled indene. While the temperature of the liquid is kept at 5–10°, dry hydrogen chloride is passed in at a moderate rate until 24–27 g. of the gas has been absorbed. The addition takes from eight to ten hours and requires little attention from the operator. The crude α-chlorohydrindene is then transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask and distilled at diminished pressure. After a small fore-run (5–10 g.) containing indene, α-chlorohydrindene boiling at 90–103°/15 mm. is collected; the yield is 80–90 g..
In a 5-l. flask fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the bottom, a fractionating column about 40 cm. long, and a return inlet tube, are placed 912 g. (7.4 moles) of crystalline guaiacol and 1500 g. (1015 cc., 8.8 moles) of 48 per cent hydrobromic acid (p. 26). This apparatus is connected with a condenser, an automatic separator, and an absorption vessel, as shown in Fig. 10. The mixture is gently heated, with continual stirring, at such a rate that the vapor at the head of the column maintains a temperature of 85–95°. The mixture of water and guaiacol which condenses passes through the automatic separator, the guaiacol being returned to the reaction vessel and the water collected in the tap funnel, from which it is removed from time to time. The gaseous methyl bromide is collected in an ice-cooled bottle containing a weighed quantity (about 1600 g.) of methyl alcohol.
B. N-(2,4-Diformyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide. A suspension of 95 g of the phenol (prepared as described under Section A) in 1 L of aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The colorless solid is filtered by suction and twice suspended in water at 40°C. Final filtration is followed with a water wash (1 L, 40°C), and the solid is sucked down on the filter. Crystallization from 800 mL of acetonitrile affords 21.8–22.3 g (66–67.5%) of N-(2,4-diformyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)acetamide, mp 215–217°C.
The product is extracted with boiling toluene in the following manner: 150 g. is placed in a fluted filter paper of 29-cm. diameter in a 25-cm. glass funnel which passes through the cork of a 2-l. flat-bottomed conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene (Fig. 21).
The air-dried product is pure white and weighs 170 g.. After drying at 100°, the anhydrous acid melts at 138–139° and weighs 157 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount). Air-dried material is suitable for the condensation to β-methylanthraquinone, p. 353. It may be recrystallized from toluene.
In a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask are placed 475 mL of distilled water and 3.75 g (0.05 mol) of reagent-grade glycine, and the pH is adjusted to 9 by the careful addition of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide. In the buffer solution thus obtained are dissolved 2.00 g (13.87 mmol) of cis-1,2-bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane, 0.58 g (0.852 mmol) of β-NAD, and 7.8 g (16.2 mmol) of FMN. To the clear orange solution obtained is added 80 units of horse-liver alcohol dehydrogenase. After the solution is gently swirled for 1 min, the pH is readjusted to 9 and the mixture is kept at room temperature with the mouth of the flask loosely covered by a watchglass. After a few minutes the color of the solution begins to darken and after several hours becomes an opaque green-brown. The pH is readjusted to 9 after 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hr by the careful addition of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide since the pH of the mixture drops progressively as the reaction proceeds. After 4 days, the mixture is brought to a pH of ca. 13.3 by the addition of 20 mL of aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide solution. After 1 hr, the mixture is continuously extracted with chloroform for 10 hr. The chloroform extract is discarded. The aqueous layer is acidified to pH 3 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and again extracted continuously for 15 hr with chloroform. To the green–orange solution are added charcoal (0.5 g), and magnesium sulfate. The dried and partially decolorized mixture is filtered through a bed of Celite, and the chloroform is removed under reduced pressure using a rotatory evaporator. The residual orange–green oil is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus to give 1.4–1.5 g (72–77% yield,) of ( + )-(1R,6S)-8-oxabicyclo[4.3.0]nonan-7-one (>97% e.e.,) as a colorless oil, bp 85–100°C (0.1–0.05 mm), mp 26–29°C, [α]D22 + 51.3° (CHCl3, c 1.1).
A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a gas inlet, an externally cooled, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a gas bubbler is charged with 15% aqueous titanium trichloride (92 mL, 0.109 mol). N,N-Dimethylformamide (70 mL) is added during 45 min with stirring and cooling (ice-bath; 0–5°C) while nitrogen is bubbled through the solution. Freshly distilled 3-buten-2-one (5.7 mL, 0.066 mol) is added at 0–5°C by syringe. The nitrogen flow is stopped, and 4-chlorobenzenediazonium chloride solution (0.044 mol) is added dropwise at 0–5°C from the dropping funnel. After 2–3 min, nitrogen evolution commences, and the rate of addition is adjusted so that 1–2 bubbles per second are vented through the bubbler. Nitrogen evolution continues for 20 min after the addition is complete (1.5 hr). The ice bath is removed and the solution stirred for 1 hr at room temperature. Ether, 50 mL, is added with stirring, and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 50 mL) and the combined organic extracts are washed with 3% aqueous Na2CO3 (2 × 30 mL) and water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled to give 5.2–6.0 g (65–75% yield) of 4-(4-chlorophenyl)butan-2-one as a pale-yellow liquid, bp 90–91°C (0.5 mm).
The crude product is divided in half and each portion is separately distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus (50 mL distillation and receiver flasks) to give a combined yield of 27.2-28.3 g (90-94%) of N-Boc-3-pyrroline as a white, crystalline, low-melting solid.
The filtrate is diluted with 60 l. of cold water and allowed to stand overnight. The brown sludge is filtered with suction and pressed as dry as possible on the funnel. After drying, it weighs about 164 g. The combined precipitates are refluxed for 30 minutes each with successive 650-, 500-, and 500-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are filtered while hot, and the bright red filtrates are combined and concentrated to a volume of 500 ml. by distillation. One liter of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90°) is added, whereupon the crude 2-nitro-6-methoxybenzonitrile separates as a red powder. It is removed by filtration and air-dried. It weighs 120–125 g. (22–23%) and melts at 148–157°. It is used without purification.
A. Diethyl sec.-butylmalonate. To 700 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a long, wide-bore reflux condenser is added 35 g. (1.52 gram atoms) of sodium cut in pieces of suitable size. When all the sodium has reacted, the flask is placed on a steam cone and fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride tube. The flask is heated, and 250 g. (1.56 moles) of diethyl malonate is added in a steady stream with stirring. After the ester addition, 210 g. (1.53 moles) of sec-butyl bromide is added at such a rate that the heat of reaction causes refluxing. The mixture is then stirred and refluxed for 48 hours. At the end of this time, the reflux condenser is exchanged for a downward condenser and the ethanol is removed by distillation. The residue is treated with 200 ml. of water, shaken, and allowed to stand until the ester layer separates. The ester layer is separated from the aqueous layer and distilled from a 500-ml. two-necked flask fitted with a well-wrapped 18-in. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 110–120°/18–20 mm. is diethyl sec-butylmalonate, and it amounts to 274–278 g. (83–84%).
The reaction mixture is poured with stirring onto a mixture of 700 g. of crushed ice and 300 ml. of a saturated solution of sodium chloride. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. To the combined organic layers is added 2 g. of hydroquinone, and the mixture is dried over calcium chloride.
C. Ethyl 2-methylindole-5-carboxylate. A solution of 10.0 g. (0.0402 mole) of ethyl 2-methyl-3-methylthioindole-5-carboxylate in 300 ml. of absolute ethanol is placed in a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer. An excess (15 teaspoons), of freshly washed W-2 Raney nickel is added, and the mixture is stirred for one hour. Stirring is then stopped, the liquid phase is decanted, and the catalyst is washed twice by stirring for 15 minutes with 100-ml. portions of absolute ethanol and decanting the solvent. The combined ethanolic solutions are concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual solid is dissolved in 150 ml. of warm dichloromethane, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered; the drying agent is washed with 40 ml. of dichloromethane. Concentration of the combined filtrates with a rotary evaporator gives 7.5–8.1 g. (93–99%) of ethyl 2-methylindole-5-carboxylate, m.p. 140.5–142.0°.
(A) 2-Nitrofluorene.—Sixty grams (0.36 mole) of fluorene is dissolved in 500 cc. of warm glacial acetic acid in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel, and supported in a water bath. The temperature is brought to 50°, and 80 cc. (1.3 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is added with stirring in the course of fifteen minutes. During the addition, the solution becomes slightly yellow, and a small amount of material precipitates. The water bath is slowly brought to 60–65°, when the precipitate dissolves and the color of the solution deepens. Stirring is continued, and heat is applied continuously until the temperature of the mixture reaches 80°. After five minutes, the water bath is removed, and the mixture, which now consists of a semi-solid paste of fine, yellow needles, is allowed to cool to room temperature during two hours. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel, sucked as dry as possible, and washed with two 25-cc. portions of cold glacial acetic acid containing 0.5 g. of potassium acetate. It is then washed several times with water and dried. The 2-nitrofluorene so obtained melts at 155–156° and is sufficiently pure for most purposes. The yield is 60 g. (79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mixture is then filtered by suction, and the precipitate dried in an oven at about 80° for twelve hours. The dry precipitate is then placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask with reflux condenser, and covered with 800 cc. of xylene. The mixture is agitated by shaking, the xylene heated to boiling for five to ten minutes, and the solution filtered through a hot funnel to remove the calomel which is formed during the reaction. The filtrate is cooled, the p-tolylmercuric chloride filtered off, and the undissolved portion extracted again with the filtrate. This is repeated twice. In this way 90–100 g. (51–57 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 233° is obtained.
A. Phenylmagnesium bromide. Ether (100 mL) is added to magnesium (Mg) turnings (74.6 g, 3.07 mol) in a dry, 5-L flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, reflux condenser, and addition funnel. Iodine (several crystals) is added and the mixture is stirred for several minutes (the color dissipates). Bromobenzene (9.23 mL, 13.76 g, 87.64 mmol) is added and the mixture is heated with a heat gun to initiate the reaction. A solution of bromobenzene (322.8 mL, 481 g, 3.06 mol) in ether (600 mL) is added dropwise over 2.75 hr, maintaining a gentle reflux. The dark brown mixture is stirred an additional 3 hr at ambient temperature under nitrogen and then cooled in an ice/methanol bath to 0°C.
The hot reaction mixture is poured with stirring over about 0.75 l. of crushed ice in a 2-l. beaker. The beaker is filled with water, and the mixture is stirred to dissolve inorganic salts. The insoluble red-brown solid is collected on a suction filter. This crude product, even while damp, is transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and 500 ml. of a mixture of 75% (375 ml.) of petroleum ether (b.p. 90–100°) and 25% (125 ml.) of benzene is added. The flask is provided with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 15 minutes by means of an electric mantle. The resulting solution is decanted into a second 2-l. flask, leaving in the first flask some water and a red-brown solid residue. To the slightly cooled liquor in the second flask is added cautiously 7 g. of powdered activated carbon. The carbon is dispersed by swirling, and the mixture is heated for an additional 5 minutes. The mixture is then filtered through a fluted filter into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. This flask is stoppered and chilled to cause crystallization of the product.
To the acetic acid filtrate is added another 100-g. portion of benzopinacol and the reaction is carried out in the same way. The yield of benzopinacolone in the second and subsequent runs is 94–94.5 g. (98–99 per cent of the theoretical amount). This procedure can be repeated in the same filtrate until 500 g. of the pinacol has been rearranged.
In a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer of high torque, a reflux condenser with a calcium chloride drying tube, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel are placed 133 g. (1.00 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 200 ml. of dry carbon disulfide. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath and stirred while 182 g. (1.50 moles) of N,N-dimethylaniline is added through the dropping funnel during a period of 15 minutes. The dropping funnel is rinsed with 20 ml. of carbon disulfide which is then run into the flask. Any aluminum chloride sticking to the walls of the flask is now scraped into the mixture, which is an easily stirred slurry of a white solid in a light-green liquid.
The filtrate is now evaporated at atmospheric pressure to remove the ethanol, and the residual oil is distilled using a Vigreux column. Ethyl hydrazinecarboxylate boils at 92–95° /13 mm. The yield is 350–370 g. (90–95%). After distillation in vacuum, the ester may crystallize; the crystals melt at 51–52°.
The solution is then cooled to 10° by means of the ice bath, and 125 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains below 15°; then an additional 75 ml. of the acid is added rapidly.
