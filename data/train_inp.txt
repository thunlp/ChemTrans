In a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and an inlet tube extending to the bottom of the flask is placed 2 l. of 30% methanolic potassium hydroxide. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and, when the solution has cooled to 10°, 100 g. (0.73 mole) of p-nitrotoluene is added to the flask. Vigorous stirring is begun, and a rapid stream of air from a compressed-air source is passed through the inlet tube. After 3 hours the ice bath is removed and the passage of air through the mixture is continued with uninterrupted, vigorous stirring for an additional 5 hours. The reaction mixture is immediately filtered with suction, and the solid, while still on the filter, is washed with 2 l. of boiling water followed by 300 ml. of 95% ethanol at room temperature. The product is allowed to dry thoroughly in air and then is dissolved in a minimum quantity of boiling benzene. The hot solution is filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble red-orange material and is allowed to cool. The p,p'-dinitrobibenzyl crystallizes as orange needles, m.p. 178–180°. The yield is 73–75 g. (74–76%). A second recrystallization from benzene gives yellow needles, m.p. 179–180°.
A 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen. To this flask is introduced a dry benzene solution (50 mL) of crude acid 3 through the septum. Then 8.9 mL (12.9 g, 0.101 mol) of oxalyl chloride is slowly added with stirring at room temperature. After the evolution of gas ceases, the solution is further heated in an oil bath maintained at 70°C for 30 min. The solvent, together with excess oxalyl chloride, is removed at room temperature first on a rotary evaporator and finally with a vacuum pump to leave the crude acid chloride of 3 as a dark-colored oil.
The residue in the flask is boiled with about 15 g. of Norite, filtered, and the treatment with the decolorizing charcoal repeated. The residue is again neutralized to litmus with dilute hydrochloric acid (about 150 cc.) and again boiled with charcoal. The hot, neutral or alkaline, yellow filtrate is finally made distinctly acid to methyl orange with additional dilute hydrochloric acid (50 to 100 cc.), boiled for a few minutes, and allowed to cool, whereupon the methone crystallizes. The product is filtered by suction from the acid liquid, washed with ice-cold water, and dried in the air. The yield is 96–122 g. (67–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
E. (1R,5S)-(−)-6,6-Dimethyl-3-oxabicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stoppered pressure-equalizing addition funnel and a reflux condenser bearing a drying tube and a nitrogen inlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is charged with a solution of 0.203 g (0.221 mmol) of Rh2 (5R-MEPY)4 (CH3CN)2 (i-PrOH) in 150 mL of freshly distilled, anhydrous dichloromethane. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux during the dropwise addition of a solution of 14.9 g (96.7 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl diazoacetate in 450 mL of anhydrous dichloromethane over a 30-hr period. The slow flow of external inert gas is terminated after 1 hr, and the evolution of nitrogen from the reaction solution is used to monitor the progress of the reaction. After the addition is complete, the blue reaction mixture is heated at reflux for an additional hour, cooled to room temperature, and the solvent is removed from the green reaction mixture under reduced pressure. Kugelrohr distillation of the residue (80°C, 0.15 mm) affords 12.1 g of a nearly colorless liquid that upon chromatographic purification on silica-alumina (100 g) with hexane:ethyl acetate (80:20 to 70:30) affords 10.2–10.7 g (84–88% yield) of >99% pure (1R,5S)-(−)-6,6-dimethyl-2-oxabicyclo- [3.1.0]hexan-2-one, bp 70°C (0.15 mm), [α]24D −81.2° (CHCl3, c 2.4), whose optical purity was determined on a Chiraldex B-PH capillary column to be 92–93% ee. The solid residue remaining after Kugelrohr distillation is dissolved in a minimal volume of methanol and purified by chromatography, as described in Part B. Isolation of the red band affords 0.098–0.099 g (~49%) of recovered catalyst.
B. (4S)-1-Tridecen-4-amine (5). In a 125-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 0.8 x 2.5 cm magnetic stirring bar, is placed a solution of compound (4S,SS)-4 (3.20 g, 21.4 mmol) in dry MeOH (100 mL), and the solution is cooled to 0-5 °C using an ice-water bath. To this cooled solution is added a 4M solution of HCl in dioxane (25 mL). After 10 min, the cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 h at room temperature. The resulting mixture is carefully concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (50 mL), cooled to 0-5 °C using an ice-water bath and treated with aqueous 6M NaOH (50 mL). After stirring for 10 min, the phases are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers are successively washed with 2M NaOH (1 × 5 mL), H2O (1 × 5 mL) and brine (1 × 5 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure (40-80 mBar). The residue is carefully dried under vacuum (ca 0.7 mmHg) until constant weight to afford pure amine 5 (1.94 g, 93%) as a yellow oil.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 200 g. (1.49 moles) of powdered malic acid and 170 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. To this suspension are added three 50-ml. portions of 20–30% fuming sulfuric acid at 45-minute intervals. After the evolution of gas has slackened, the solution is heated on a water bath for 2 hours with occasional shaking. The reaction mixture is then cooled and poured slowly onto 800 g. of crushed ice with stirring. After standing 24 hours, the acid is filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed with three 50-ml. portions of ice-cold water, and dried on a water bath. The yield of crude acid, melting at 195–200°, is 75–80 g. and.
The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and then vacuum-filtered through a 350-mL, medium frit, sintered-glass Büchner funnel that is filled to a height of 4 cm with ethyl acetate-impregnated Celite 521. Four 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate are used to wash the pad of Celite 521. The filtrate is partially concentrated by removal of ethyl acetate under reduced pressure. The resulting brown liquid is slowly poured into 1.5 L of water. After standing for 8 hr, the precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration and air dried. The solid is dissolved in 500 mL of acetonitrile, the resulting solution is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel, and is washed with three 300-mL portions of hexanes. The acetonitrile layer is concentrated to provide 24 g of crude product as a brown solid.
The crude quinone (50 g.) is recrystallized from 250 ml. of o-dichlorobenzene without filtering; the crystals are rinsed with methanol. The recovery is 45 g., m.p. 259–260°,.
After 24 hours the mixture is filtered and distilled under reduced pressure through a good column. The following fractions are collected:
After the flask has been cooled by immersion in ice water, 44 g. (0.5 mole) of dry ethyl acetate in an equal volume of ether is added over a period of twelve minutes. The cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for ten minutes. When the reaction flask has again been cooled by the ice-water bath, a previously prepared ammonium chloride solution is added, very slowly at first, over a period of ten minutes, during which a pasty solid separates.
The contents of the flask are transferred to a separatory funnel; the ether layer is separated and distilled without washing or drying through a small packed column until the distillation temperature begins to rise (38–40°). The residue is transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with two 500-ml. portions of water, dried over 10 g. of calcium chloride, and fractionated through the small packed column. After distillation of ether and some allyl chloride (b.p. 45°) biallyl is collected as a colorless liquid in a yield of 135–160 g. (55–65%), b.p. 59–60°/760 mm.; nD20 1.4040; nD25 1.4012.
A. Cholesta-3,5-dien-3-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate. A dry, 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a pressure-equalizing 100-mL dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, is charged with 4.62 g (22.5 mmol) of 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine and 60 mL of dry dichloromethane. Then 3.08 mL (18.75 mmol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added rapidly from a syringe and 5.77 g (15 mmol) of cholest-4-en-3-one diluted 40 mL of dry dichloromethane is added through the dropping funnel, dropwise and with stirring, during 15–20 min. The mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature. During this period the solution turns slightly pink and a white precipitate separates. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator and the residue is combined with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The white pyridinium trifluoromethanesulfonate salt is filtered off and washed with additional diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The ethereal solution is washed with cold 2 N hydrochloric acid (2 × 100 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (3 × 100 mL), dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and concentrated at reduced pressure. The solid residue (7.21–7.40 g) is recrystallized from hexane to give 6.46–6.72 g (83–87%) of cholesta-3,5-dien-3-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate as white crystals, mp 125–126°C.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask mounted on a steam bath in the hood and equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a wide-bore condenser is placed 1.4 kg. (1.1 l.) of carbon disulfide. Through the open neck of the flask 202 g. (1.5 moles) of acetanilide and 300 g. (2.66 moles) of chloroacetyl chloride are introduced. The mixture is vigorously stirred while 600 g. (4.5 moles) of aluminum chloride is added in 25–50 g. portions over a period of 20–30 minutes; the neck of the flask is stoppered between additions. After the addition of the last portion of aluminum chloride, the mixture is heated at reflux temperature for 30 minutes while stirring is continued. Heating and stirring are discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand for 3 hours, during which time it separates into layers. The upper layer (carbon disulfide) is decanted, and the viscous red-brown lower layer is poured cautiously with stirring into about 1 kg. of finely crushed ice to which 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. After the hydrolysis of the aluminum chloride, the product crystallizes as a white solid, which is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed well with water. It is then transferred to a beaker where it is thoroughly washed by stirring with sufficient 95% ethanol to give a fluid slurry. The solid is again collected on the funnel. After drying in the air it melts at 213–214° and weighs 250–265 g. (79–83%). It can be recrystallized from 95% ethanol (about 1 l. of the solvent being required for 40 g. of the solid) as fine white crystals melting at 216°; the recovery in the recrystallization, without reworking of the mother liquor, is about 70%.
(B) Dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine.—The following operations should be performed under a hood. In a 2-l. three-necked flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and two dropping funnels, are placed 80 g. (0.33 mole) of dibenzoylhydrazine, 10 g. (0.25 mole) of sodium hydroxide, and 600 cc. of water. The mixture is maintained at about 90° by heating on a water bath. With stirring, 320 g. (240 cc., 2.54 moles) of methyl sulfate and 250 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 125 g. (3.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added from separate dropping funnels. The methyl sulfate is added in 10-cc. portions at five-minute intervals, the sodium hydroxide solution at a rate that maintains the reaction mixture slightly alkaline. When markedly alkaline the mixture has a distinctly yellow color; it is best to maintain a degree of alkalinity slightly less than that required to produce this color.
The solution is then transferred to a continuous extractor and extracted with ether for about 16 hours. The ether extract is added in convenient portions to a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask fitted with a condenser and a suitable fraction-cutter for distillation under reduced pressure. The ether is removed by distillation under the diminished pressure of a water pump, and the residue is then distilled at about 10 mm. pressure. After a small fore-run which weighs 2–5 g., the product distils as a clear, colorless, viscous oil at 62–66°/9–10 mm.; n25D 1.4513. The yield is 90–95 g. (74–79%) and.
(B) Ethyl Oxomalonate.—A rapid stream of nitrous anhydride is passed into the cold ethyl malonate, which becomes dark green in color. There should be an increase in weight of about 200 g. in absorption bottle J in two to three hours.
The oil is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-cc. portions of benzene. The extracts are combined with the oil, and the solvent is removed by distillation. Fractionation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 80–95 g. of a methyl benzyl ketone fraction, boiling at 110–120°/21–22 mm., and a residue of dibenzyl ketone. The main fraction on redistillation yields 74–87 g. (55–65 per cent of the theoretical amount) of methyl benzyl ketone boiling at 110–115°/21–22 mm.,, and.
The crude product is dried over calcium chloride and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of pure, colorless, 2,3-dibromopropene boiling at 73–76° /75 mm. is 105–120 g. (74–84 per cent of the theoretical amount). A small quantity of tribromopropane, usually about 5 per cent of the crude material, remains in the distilling flask.
In a 1-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected from atmospheric moisture with a drying tube containing calcium chloride are placed 350 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran and 3.80 g. (0.100 mole) of powdered lithium aluminum hydride. The slurry is stirred while a solution of 11.27 g. (0.0500 mole) of dibenzyl ketoxime in 80 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise with cooling at 20° over a 10-minute period. The contents of the flask are gradually heated to reflux with stirring in an oil bath at 90° (external temperature) for 3 hours; at ca. 62° the color of the mixture turns from the initial pale green to a permanent, light chocolate color (reaction may be exothermic at this point). The mixture is cooled with ice water and decomposed by gradual addition of 12 ml. of water at a temperature below 20°. The precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with 100 ml. of ether, and added to 200 ml. of ether. This mixture is stirred for ca. 10 minutes and filtered, and the residue is washed with 100 ml. of ether. The ethereal extracts and washings are combined with the original filtrate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate over-night, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at 30° (20 mm.) to give 10.60–11.0 g. of a pale yellow oil.
A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Trubore stirrer and paddle is charged with 172.8 g. (1.200 moles) of 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid and 1500 ml. of benzene. The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux, and 200 ml. of benzene and benzene-water azeotrope is removed by distillation to ensure anhydrous conditions. The flask is then fitted with an addition funnel and a reflux condenser attached to a drying tube. Stirring and heating are continued, and over a 40-minute period, 170 g. (102 ml., 1.26 moles) of sulfuryl chloride is added from the funnel, while 4.0 g. of benzoyl peroxide is added simultaneously in small portions through the top of the condenser. After a short induction period, hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide are evolved. After the addition is complete, heating at reflux is maintained for 22 hours. The solid is dissolved after 1 hour, leaving a light brown solution. After the heating period is complete, the benzene is removed by distillation, and the residue is heated to 190–210° for 45 minutes to effect decarboxylation. The black residue is transferred to a small flask and distilled under vacuum through a 6-cm. Vigreux column. After a forerun of about 25–30 g., 65–79 g. (40–49%) of cis- and trans-3-chlorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid is collected as a light yellow liquid, b.p. 131–137° (15 mm.) nD24 1.4790. A black residue remains in the distillation flask.
The solution is then poured slowly, with constant stirring, into a mixture of 1 kg. of cracked ice and 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 5-l. flask. There should be a small quantity of ice remaining after decomposition is complete. When the ice has melted, the mixture of water, precipitated dibenzoylbutane, and benzene is divided into two equal portions, and 1–1.25 l. of benzene is added to each. The solid is dissolved by shaking and gentle warming on the steam bath; the benzene layers are separated and washed, first with an equal volume of dilute sodium carbonate solution, and then with water.
(A) Citraconic Anhydride.—Two hundred and fifty grams of itaconic anhydride is distilled rapidly at atmospheric pressure in a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 15-cm. (6-in.) fractionating column. The receivers for the distillate must be changed without interrupting the distillation. The distillate passing over below 200° consists of water and other decomposition products. The fraction which distils at 200–215° consists of citraconic anhydride and is collected separately. The yield is 170–180 g. (68–72 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 5.5–6°. On redistillation under reduced pressure there is obtained 155–165 g. (62–66 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which boils at 105–110°/22 mm. and melts at 7–8°.
In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a low-temperature thermometer is placed 500 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (6.0 moles), and the solution is cooled to 0°. To the cooled solution, 142 g. (1.5 moles) of 2-aminopyrimidine is added portionwise with stirring until a homogeneous solution is obtained. The solution is cooled to −15°, and a 500-ml. dropping funnel is fitted to the flask. A cold solution of 207 g. (3.0 moles) of sodium nitrite in 375 ml. of water is then added dropwise with stirring over a period of 55 minutes, the reaction temperature being maintained at −15° to −10°. The solution is stirred an additional hour, and the temperature is allowed to rise to −5°. The mixture is then carefully neutralized to about pH 7 with a 30% solution of sodium hydroxide (about 3.0 moles), care being taken not to allow the temperature to rise above 0°. The solid which forms, consisting of 2-chloropyrimidine and sodium chloride, is collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with ether to dissolve all the 2-chloropyrimidine. The cold solution is extracted with four 75-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent is removed, and the residue is recrystallized from isopentane to give white crystals of 2-chloropyrimidine. The yield is 44–46 g. (26–27%), m.p. 64.5–65.5°.
A 500-ml. Pyrex heavy-walled narrow-mouthed pressure bottle is charged with 100 ml. of ether, 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, 50.0 g. (0.48 mole) of malonic acid, and approximately 120 ml. (about 1.5 moles) of isobutylene, which is liquefied by passage into a large test tube immersed in a Dry Ice-acetone bath. The bottle is closed with a rubber stopper which is clamped or wired securely in place and is shaken mechanically at room temperature until the suspended malonic acid dissolves. The bottle is chilled in an ice-salt bath and opened; then the contents are poured into a separatory funnel containing 250 ml. of water, 70 g. of sodium hydroxide, and 250 g. of ice. The mixture is shaken (carefully at first), the layers are separated, and the aqueous portion is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether. The organic layers are combined, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered into a dropping funnel attached to the neck of a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask. The flask is immersed in an oil bath at about 100°, and the excess isobutylene and ether are removed by flash distillation effected by allowing the solution to run in slowly from the dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is then removed, and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 112–115°/31 mm. is collected. The yield of colorless di-tert-butyl malonate is 60.0–62.0 g. (58–60%), n25D 1.4158–1.4161, freezing point −5.9 to −6.1° and.
The reaction mixture is cooled, 250 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is made acid to litmus by addition of a cooled solution of 100 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 ml. of water. Chipped ice is added if necessary to keep the mixture cool. The upper ester layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 200 ml. of ether. The combined ether and ester layers are shaken with 350 ml. of a saturated sodium bicarbonate solution until no more carbon dioxide is evolved, and then the organic layer is washed with 200 ml. of water. The water layer is combined with the sodium bicarbonate solution and extracted with 400 ml. of ether. The combined ether and ester layers are dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation on the steam bath, and the excess ethyl benzoate and acetoacetic ester are then removed by distillation under reduced pressure through a 15-cm. fractionating column. Finally, the ethyl benzoylactetate is distilled at 101–106° /1 mm. (130–135° /3 mm.). The yield of ester boiling over a 5° range is 190–210 g. (50–55% based on the ethyl acetoacetate).
The acetylene is shut off, and the gas inlet tube and iron wire are removed, but not the bent glass tubing. A potassium hydroxide tower is attached to the end of this tubing, and a dropping funnel is mounted in the other neck of the flask. n-Butyl bromide (548 g., 428 ml., 4.0 moles) is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 45–60 minutes. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours. Ammonium hydroxide (500 ml.) is then added dropwise, followed by about 1–1.5 l. of distilled water. When the frost on the outside of the flask is loose and can be pulled off easily, the contents of the flask are transferred to a large separatory funnel, and the lower aqueous layer is removed. The organic layer is washed with 100 ml. of distilled water, then with about 100 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid (the aqueous layer should be tested to make sure that it remains acid; if not, another washing with acid should be carried out), and finally with about 100 ml. of 10% sodium carbonate solution. The material is dried over potassium carbonate, a small amount of solid sodium carbonate is added, and the liquid is fractionated through a helix-packed column of about 10–14 plates. The yield of pure n-butylacetylene is 230–252 g. (70–77%); b.p. 71–72°, n20D 1.3984–1.3990 and.
B. 4-Phenyl-5-anilino-1,2,3-triazole. Six grams (0.025 mole) of 1,4-diphenyl-5-amino-1,2,3-triazole is dissolved in 20 g. of dry pyridine (distilled from solid sodium hydroxide) and heated under reflux for 24 hours. The reaction mixture is poured into 1 l. of ice water. The product separates as a slightly yellowish milky oil which is converted to white needle-like crystals by stirring the mixture and scratching the beaker with a glass rod. The product is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, suction-dried, and recrystallized from aqueous ethanol. The yield is 5.5–5.6 g. (92–93%) of fine white needle-like crystals, m.p. 167–169°, soluble in hot water and ether, but difficultly soluble in benzene.
The diazotized solution is poured into a 1.5-l. wide-mouthed flask or bottle which is surrounded by ice water. Three hundred cubic centimeters of cold benzene is now poured into the diazonium solution, and by means of a good stirrer the two liquids are intimately mixed. The mixture, which is at the temperature of melting benzene, is now ready for the addition of alkali.
B. Biphenyl. Added to a solution of 10 g. (0.032 mole) of the product from Part A in 200 ml. of benzene is 2 g. of 5% palladium-on-charcoal, and the mixture is shaken with hydrogen in a Parr apparatus at 40 p.s.i. and 35–40° for 8 hours. The mixture is filtered, and the insoluble residue is washed with three 100-ml. portions of hot ethanol. The filtrates are combined, and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 60° (12 mm.), leaving a solid residue, which is dissolved in 100 ml. of benzene. After adding 100 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide the mixture is shaken, and the layers separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of benzene, and the original benzene layer is washed with 100 ml. of water. The benzene solutions are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. Removal of the benzene by distillation yields 4.0–4.7 g. (82–96%) of biphenyl as a white powder, m.p. 68–70°. The IR spectrum is identical with that of an authentic sample, and a purity of at least 99.5% was indicated by GC analysis.
The crude material is dissolved with stirring in 910 ml. of ethylene chloride heated to 60° in a water bath. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, 122 ml. of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate is added to the resulting slurry, and the mixture is stirred for 1 hours. The layers are then separated in a separatory funnel, and the ethylene chloride slurry is heated to 60° in a water bath. The resulting solution is filtered through a small cotton plug in a preheated funnel. Absolute ethanol (313 ml.) is added to the filtrate, and the mixture is stored in an icebox overnight while the product crystallizes. The crystals are collected on a filter and washed with 40 ml. of ether. The product is recrystallized by dissolving it in ethylene chloride (3.0 ml. per g. of product) heated to 60° in a water bath and cooling. The yield of white to light pink plates, m.p. 129–130°, is 230–246 g. (68–73%).
A. Diethyl isopropylidenemalonate. A 2-l. flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 400 g. (2.50 moles) of diethyl malonate, 216 g. (3.73 moles) of acetone, 320 g. (3.14 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 50 g. (0.37 mole) of anhydrous zinc chloride (assay 98.9%,). The solution is heated at reflux, with stirring, for 20–24 hours, then cooled and diluted with 300–350 ml. of benzene. The resulting dark-colored solution is washed with four 500-ml. portions of water, and the combined aqueous layers are extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene. The combined benzene solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 30-cm. Vigreux column or spinning band column. After separation of the unchanged diethyl malonate [119–135 g., b.p. 85–87° (9 mm.)] and intermediate fractions [b.p. 87–104° (9 mm.)], diethyl isopropylidenemalonate is collected as 231–246 g. (46–49%) of colorless liquid, b.p. 110–115° (9–10 mm.), n20D 1.4483–1.4490.
A. Ethyl α-carbethoxy-β-m-chloroanilinoacrylate. A few boiling chips are added to a mixture of 127.5 g. (1.0 mole) of m-chloroaniline and 233 g. (1.1 moles) of ethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate (p. 395) in an open 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour, the evolved ethanol being allowed to escape. The warm product is used directly in the next step.
In a 1.1-l. steel reaction vessel are placed 200 g. (1.08 moles) of 4-bromo-o-xylene (p. 138), 14 g. copper wire, and 600 ml. (540 g., 9.0 moles) of 28% ammonia containing 12 g. of cuprous chloride. The steel reaction vessel is heated and rocked at 195° (thermostatic control) for 14 hours; the pressure rises to 700–1000 lb. After cooling, the bomb is emptied and the two layers are separated; 40 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide is added to the organic layer, and the mixture is steam-distilled. The amine distils and crystallizes when the distillate is cooled. It is separated from the water and dissolved in 500 ml. of 8% hydrochloric acid; the acid solution is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are discarded, and the acid solution is made alkaline with 160 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide. The resulting mixture is steam-distilled. The distillate is cooled, most of the water is decanted, and the crystalline xylidine is dissolved by shaking with two 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are dried over calcium chloride and concentrated by distillation at a steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure from a Claisen flask. The yield of 3,4-dimethylaniline, boiling at 116–118°/22–25 mm., is 103 g. (79%). This crude product is recrystallized from 200 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°); the hot solution is placed in a refrigerator, and the crystallization is allowed to proceed overnight. The yield of recrystallized 3,4-dimethylaniline is 86 g. (66%); it melts at 47.3–49.2°.
A. Methylenecyclopropane. A dry, 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask with ground-glass fittings is equipped with a sealed stirrer driven by a heavy-duty motor, an efficient condenser fitted with a silica gel drying tube, and a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel connected to a nitrogen inlet. The flask is charged with 450 g. (11.5 moles) of sodium amide and 750 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the dropping funnel with a solution of 283.5 g. (3.831 moles) of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol in 300 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran While the sodium amide suspension is stirred vigorously under a nitrogen atmosphere, the solution of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise at room temperature over 3 hours. The stirred mixture is heated to 45°, with an oil bath, for 2 hours, at which point it may be necessary to add additional tetrahydrofuran. The outlet of the condenser is connected with an adapter to a 250-ml. gas washing bottle containing 100 ml. of 5 N sulfuric acid, to eliminate evolved ammonia. A silica gel drying tube (15 cm. long) joins the gas washing bottle to a 300-ml. cold trap protected from the atmosphere with a calcium chloride drying tube and cooled in a methanol–dry-ice bath maintained at −80°. A solution of 228 g. (2.52 moles) of 3-chloro-2-methyl-1-propene in 500 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred basic mixture, which is then heated to 65° over a period of approximately 8 hours; a light nitrogen stream is used to carry the methylenecyclopropane into the cold trap. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred and heated to 65° for 3 more hours. The trap flask contains 58 g. (43%) of methylenecyclopropane.
A solution of 130 g. (0.52 mole) of this ester in 400 cc. of ethyl alcohol is placed in a two-necked 2-l. flask, carrying a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser, and is heated to boiling. Then one-third of a solution of 78.5 g. (1.4 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 400 cc. of alcohol is added from the dropping funnel, and the alcoholic solution is boiled until it becomes clear. Then a second third of the alkali solution is added, and the reaction mixture is again boiled until any precipitate disappears. Finally, the last third of the alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution is added. The addition of the alkali requires about twenty minutes. The reaction mixture is then boiled for forty minutes longer.
More fumaric acid may be obtained from the filtrate by heating it on the water bath with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid; the solution usually turns blue at the end of the reaction. The solution is concentrated to about 700 cc. and then cooled with running water. The fumaric acid which separates is collected on a filter and dried in the air. It weighs 10–15 g. and melts at 282–284° in a sealed tube.
A. Racemic trans-2-(N-benzyl)amino-1-cyclohexanol (rac-3). An autoclave with a properly fitted 400-mL glass insert is charged with cyclohexene oxide (1) (61.5 mL, 59.7 g, 0.596 mol, 1.1 equiv) and benzylamine (2) (60.0 mL, 58.8 g, 0.543 mol, 1 equiv), equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, sealed and flushed with nitrogen. The reaction mixture is placed in a 250 °C preheated oven for 6 h, then cooled to ambient temperature, diluted with dichloromethane (60 mL) and transferred into a 1000-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask. The glass inlay is rinsed with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL) and the combined organic phases are concentrated using a rotary evaporator (30 mmHg, ambient temperature). The residual cyclohexene oxide is removed under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) at room temperature over 11 h to yield 110.68 g (99%) amino alcohol rac-3 as a light yellow solid, which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.
In a 1.5-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask, fitted with a dropping funnel, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer, is placed 176 g. (2 moles) of tert.-amyl alcohol (redistilled, b.p. range 0.5°). The flask is surrounded by a water bath, and the temperature of the alcohol is held at 50–60° while 320 g. (103 cc., 2 moles) of bromine is slowly added with stirring during about two hours. The stirring is continued for a few minutes until the bromine color has disappeared.
In a 3-l. flask a mixture of 330 g. (1.8 moles) of air-dried p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride with 100 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 1.5 l. of 95 per cent alcohol is heated on the steam bath for thirty minutes and filtered to remove sodium chloride and unchanged carbonate. The filtrate is placed with 300 g. (1.6 moles) of 2,4-dinitrotoluene (m.p. 70°) in a 5-l. flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser and heated on the steam bath with stirring for five hours. When the contents of the flask are cold, the condensation product is collected on a Büchner funnel and well drained by means of a suction pump and a piece of "rubber dam" fastened over the top of the funnel. The rubber is drawn down onto the solid by the suction, thus forcing the liquid out. The dark green solid is washed by transferring it to a large beaker, stirring it with 1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol on the steam bath for half an hour, cooling, and filtering again, using the rubber dam. The dinitrobenzylidene-p-aminodimethylaniline is placed while still damp in a large round-bottomed flask containing 500 cc. of a mixture of equal volumes of concentrated hydrochloric acid and water, and steam is blown in by a tube reaching to the lowest part of the vessel. Vigorous injection of steam is continued for fifteen minutes after the liquid has reached a temperature of 105°.
A. Triethyl α-phthalimidoethane-α,α,β-tricarboxylate. Three hundred and twenty-seven grams (1.0 mole) of diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate2 and 735 g. (6.0 moles) of ethyl chloroacetate (b.p. 144–145°) are placed in a 2-l. Claisen flask fitted with a reflux condenser and rubber stoppers. The mixture is heated under reflux in an oil bath at 150–160° for 2.25 hours. The excess ethyl chloroacetate is removed by distillation at 30 mm. until the heating bath temperature reaches 150° and no more distillate is obtained. The brown residual mass is cooled and then extracted with 1250 ml. of ether. The oil dissolves, leaving a solid residue which is separated by filtration and washed with 750 ml. of ether. The combined ether extracts are distilled to remove ether, and the residual oil is heated on a steam bath under reduced pressure (35 mm.) to remove traces of ethyl chloroacetate. The yield of triethyl α-phthalimidoethane-α,α,β-tricarboxylate, dried at 45° for 48 hours, is 373–389 g. (95–99%).
A solution consisting of 127 g. (1.00 mole) of N-cyclohexylformamide, 500 ml. (490 g., 6.2 moles) of pyridine, and 300 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60° or 30–60°) is charged into a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer,2 dropping funnel, reflux condenser, and thermometer. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 92 g. (0.60 mole) of phosphorous oxychloride is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture in the course of 30–40 minutes. The mixture is stirred under reflux for 10 minutes after all the phosphorus oxychloride is added. The mixture is then cooled to 0–5°; this converts it to a heavy slurry. Ice water (800 ml.) is gradually added with stirring, and stirring of the cold mixture is continued until all solid material has dissolved. The organic phase is separated in a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted with three 60-ml. portions of petroleum ether, and the extracts are combined with the organic phase, which is then extracted with three 100-ml. portions of water, dried over 20 g. of magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a 40-cm. vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The petroleum ether is rapidly removed under slightly reduced pressure from a bath at a temperature not exceeding 50–60°. Cyclohexyl isocyanide, a colorless foul-smelling liquid, is collected at 56–58° /11 mm.; weight 73–79 g. (67–72%); nD25 1.4488–1.4501.
B. 1-Chloro-N,N,2-trimethylpropenylamine. The flask is equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser protected from moisture with a sulfuric acid trap. The iminium chloride is suspended in 200 ml. of anhydrous dichloromethane, and 140 g. (1.39 moles) of triethylamine is slowly added to the mixture from the dropping funnel, with vigorous stirring, over 1 hour. The temperature rises to 45°, and the solvent begins to reflux. The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 2 hours, after which 150 ml. of dry, low-boiling petroleum ether is added to complete the precipitation of triethylamine hydrochloride. The mixture is quickly filtered under nitrogen into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask through an Iena sintered-glass filter. A 300-ml. portion of petroleum ether is used to wash the flask and the triethylamine hydrochloride on the filter. The solvent is removed by distillation under nitrogen. Further distillation through a Vigreux column under nitrogen gives 93–103 g. (69–77%) of 1-chloro-N,N,2-trimethylpropenylamine, b.p. 125–130° (760 mm.) and. The compound is very sensitive to humidity and should be immediately stored in ampoules.
The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, poured with stirring into a 600-ml. beaker containing 200 g. of crushed ice, and treated with 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting two-phase mixture and 50 ml. of chloroform are transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel; the chloroform-nitrobenzene layer is separated and washed with three 100-ml. portions of water. The organic layer is transferred to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask, and steam-distilled. A fairly rapid flow of steam is used, and the distillation flask is heated in an oil bath at about 120°. After about 3 hours (3–4 l. of water) the distillation is stopped, and the residue in the flask is allowed to cool. Residual water in the flask is decanted from the solid organic material and extracted with chloroform. The solid residue in the flask is dissolved in 100 ml. of chloroform and separated from any water left in the flask, and the chloroform layers are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the solid residue, weighing 50–65 g. (still slightly wet with chloroform), is distilled under vacuum. The receiving flask should be immersed in ice water, and the fraction boiling about 150–165° (0.02 mm.) is collected.
C. α-Tosylbenzyl isocyanide (3). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, a 100-mL addition funnel and a temperature probe is charged with 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 27.6 g (94.8 mmol) of N-(α-tosylbenzyl)formamide (2). Phosphorus oxychloride (17.7 mL, 190 mmol), is added and the resulting solution is stirred for 5 min at 25°C. After cooling the solution to 0°C, 79.3 mL (569 mmol) of triethylamine, is added slowly over 30-45 min while keeping the internal reaction temperature below 10°C. After the triethylamine addition is complete, the reaction is warmed to 5-10°C and held there for 30-45 min. Ethyl acetate (140 mL) and water (140 mL) are added sequentially to the reaction, the mixture is stirred for 5 min and, after transferring the mixture to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is removed. The organic layer is washed with water (2 × 140 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution (140 mL) and brine (70 mL). The organic layer is transferred to a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with 140 mL of 1-propanol, and this solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to half of its original volume. The residue is cooled to 5-10°C for 30 min and the beige solid that crystallizes is filtered through a Büchner funnel. The filter cake is rinsed twice with 75 mL of 1-propanol . The beige solid is dried under vacuum for 3-4 hr to give 18.1-19.7 g (70-76%) of α-tosylbenzyl isocyanide (3).
B. Methyl 2-(benzylamino)methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate . A dried, 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 68.7 g (0.53 mol) of methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenebutanoate and 800 mL of anhydrous methanol . After the addition of 57.7 mL (0.53 mol) of benzylamine, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 48 hr. The methanol is removed under reduced pressure to leave 125.6 g (100%) of the amino ester as a clear oil, essentially pure by 1H NMR analysis.
The residue is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, resulting in the collection of fractions which boil respectively below 165°, at 165–210°, and at 210–220°, all under 19–20 mm. pressure. The lower fractions are mixed with the fraction which boils at 120–130°, and distilled as before after the addition of one drop of phosphoric acid, when a further quantity of material boiling at 210–222° /20 mm. is obtained. This fraction, amounting to 1100–1200 g., consists of crude benzoic anhydride. The lower-boiling fractions may be redistilled until they become too small to justify further work.
A. 1-Pyrrolidinocyclohexene.4 A solution of 29.4 g. (0.300 mole) of cyclohexanone and 28.4 g. (0.394 mole) of pyrrolidine in 150 ml. of benzene is placed in a 500-ml., one-necked flask attached to a Dean-Stark trap. The solution is refluxed under a nitrogen atmosphere until the separation of water ceases. The excess pyrrolidine and benzene are removed from the reaction mixture on a rotary evaporator. The resulting residue is stored under refrigeration and distilled just before use in the next step, yielding 44.6 g. (98%) of 1-pyrrolidinocyclohexene, b.p. 76–77° (0.5 mm.), 105–106° (13 mm.).
A. trans-2,4-Pentadienoic acid. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser cooled with ice-cold water bearing a calcium chloride drying tube, and a powder funnel. The flask is charged with 206 g. (210 ml., 2.61 moles) of pyridine, and with vigorous stirring 208 g. (2.00 moles) of powdered malonic acid is added in portions. The powder funnel is replaced by a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 126 g. (150 ml., 2.25 moles) of acrolein, which is added, with vigorous stirring, over a 30-minute period. The exothermic reaction begins immediately with evolution of carbon dioxide, and the gently refluxing mixture becomes homogeneous. After 1 hour, as carbon dioxide evolution ceases, the solution is poured onto 1 l. of ice in a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and carefully acidified with 130 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of dichloromethane, and the organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate for ca. 10 minutes. The dichloromethane solution is concentrated to ca. 300 ml. on a rotary evaporator with the water bath at 20–30° and allowed to crystallize in a freezer at −10° for several hours. After a first crop, yielding 40–50 g. of product, m.p. 72–73°, is collected, three additional crops are taken following successive concentration of the mother liquor to 150, 70, and 30 ml. Dried under reduced pressure in the presence of phosphorous pentoxide, the four crops of off-white crystals total 82–90 g. (42–46%), m.p. 69–71°.
(A) Nitrosodimethylamine.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer are placed 245 g. (3 moles) of dimethylamine hydrochloride, 120 cc. of water, and 10 cc. of approximately 2 N hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution is stirred vigorously and maintained at 70–75° by heating on a water bath, while 235 g. (3.23 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite suspended in 150 cc. of water is added from a dropping funnel over a period of an hour. The reaction mixture is tested frequently and maintained barely acid to litmus by further 1-cc. additions of 2 N hydrochloric acid when necessary (about 30–35 cc. of acid is required). Stirring and heating are continued for two hours after all the sodium nitrite has been added.
The resulting mixture consists of an organic phase and a lower aqueous phase containing a small amount of insoluble material. The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and the phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, which is combined with the original organic phase and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. Approximately 150 ml. of xylene is added to the flask and the contents of the flask are heated to reflux to remove any water present as the azeotrope. The resulting hot solution is filtered rapidly through a large Büchner funnel with light suction. The volume is reduced to approximately 100 ml., and the solution is cooled in an ice bath. The tan crystals which separate are collected in a Büchner funnel and washed with 10 ml. of ice-cold xylene. The crude product is recrystallized from 150 ml. of xylene, yielding, after drying, 7.4–7.6 g. (52–53%) of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)isoxazole, m.p. 175–176°.
To a suspension of 38.3 g. (31.5 ml., 0.30 mole) of o-chloroaniline in 300 ml. of warm water is added, with stirring, 27.5 ml. (0.33 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (12N). The resulting solution is placed in a 500-ml. porcelain evaporating dish, 25 g. (0.33 mole) of ammonium thiocyanate is added, and the mixture is heated on the steam bath for 1 hour. The liquid, from which a mass of large needles of o-chloroaniline thiocyanate separates, is allowed to cool, set aside at room temperature for 1 hour, and then evaporated slowly to dryness over a period of 2–3 hours. The crystalline residue is crushed finely, 300 ml. of water is added, and again the mixture is evaporated slowly. The dry grayish white residual powder is heated finally on the steam bath for 4–5 hours.
A. (1) Preparation of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane. (See.) To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with two inlet tubes (with sintered-glass diffusers at the end) connected to a chlorine cylinder, and a reflux condenser connected to an outlet tube immersed in a potassium hydroxide solution, are added 1200 g (13.64 mol) of anhydrous dioxane (free of peroxides!) and 8 g (0.03 mol) of iodine. A stream of chlorine is passed through the dioxane/iodine solution heated at 90°C, and the reaction is monitored by NMR spectroscopy. After 9 hr, the conversion is 50% complete; after 33 hr, about 90% complete. At this point, the stream of chlorine is interrupted. Reinitiation of the chlorine stream after some hours (next morning, for example) may be dangerous because it was observed in one case the mixture inflamed spontaneously! The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, 500 mL of ether is added, and the solution is washed with aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution. The organic layer is separated, dried over sodium sulfate, the ether is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column, to yield 1200–1300 g of trans-2,3-dichloro-1,4-dioxane, bp 89°C/16 mm (lit.1 bp 82.5°C/14 mm; mp 31°C).
2-[(5-Oxo-1-cyclohepten-1-yl)methyl]-1H-isoindole-1,3(2H)-dione. An oven-dried (>150 °C for 12 h), three-necked, 200-mL, round-bottomed flask, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, thermometer, rubber septum, and Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar are assembled while hot, and the apparatus is cooled under a stream of nitrogen venting to a manifold (20 min). The septum is removed and the flask is charged with [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 (55.0 mg, 0.141 mmol, 0.005 equiv) and N-propargyl phthalimide (5.99 g, 32.3 mmol, 1.15 equiv). The rubber septum is replaced and the apparatus is gently re-flushed (5 min) with a stream of nitrogen and then kept under a positive nitrogen pressure using a mineral oil bubbler attached to the outlet. 1,2-Dichloroethane (52 mL) is added via syringe, and magnetic stirring is started. 1-(2-Methoxyethoxy)-1-vinylcyclopropane (VCP, 4.3 mL, 4.00 g, 28.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added in a single portion via syringe (ca. 1 min later). At this time, the thermometer is immersed in the amber-colored heterogeneous reaction mixture and reads 25 °C. Under a positive pressure of nitrogen, the rubber septum is replaced by a Teflon stopper and the reaction vessel is lowered into a preheated oil bath (external bath temperature 90-100 °C). Within five min after the start of heating, the reaction mixture becomes golden yellow and homogeneous and reaches an internal reflux temperature of 82-84 °C. The progress of the reaction is followed by TLC analysis until consumption of the VCP is complete (25 min, during which time the homogeneous reaction solution darkens in color from golden yellow to orange to a deep red-brown).
The combined yield of crude acid (260–270 g.) is dissolved in 1 l. of water, boiled with about 25 g. of Norite, filtered through a heated filter, and crystallized by placing in an ice-salt freezing mixture and stirring vigorously. A finely crystalline, colorless product is obtained in this way. If the acid is allowed to crystallize slowly the crystals are somewhat colored. The yield of pure resorcylic acid melting at 216–217° is 160–170 g. (57–60 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(E) Sodium Dimethylglyoximate.—To a solution of 75 g. of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water is added, with stirring, 100 g. of dimethylglyoxime. Heat is applied to effect solution, and the mixture is filtered from any slight residue. The solution is poured while hot into 500 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. After cooling to 5°, with stirring, the crystals which form are filtered, then suspended in 150 cc. of alcohol and again filtered, and finally dried at 25° until the solid has no odor of alcohol. The yield is 213–230 g. (81–88 per cent of the theoretical amount) of the octahydrate.
After all the methyl sulfate has been added, the temperature is raised to 65–70° for about forty minutes to complete the distillation of the methyl iodide. The product is separated from a small amount of water, dried thoroughly over anhydrous calcium chloride, and decanted into a dry distilling flask. A few crystals of potassium iodide are added, and the material is distilled from a water bath. The yield of methyl iodide, boiling at 41–43°, is 615–640 g. (90–94 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After the last precipitation, the m-nitrocinnamic acid is washed with a little water and then sucked as dry as possible. The product, which still contains considerable water, is dissolved in 250–300 cc. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol from which the nitrocinnamic acid crystallizes on cooling. The yield is 47–49 g. (74–77 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is pale yellow and melts at 192–194°. If a purer product is desired, it may be recrystallized from benzene or alcohol.
A. Ethyl β-pyrrolidinocrotonate. Ethyl acetoacetate (130 g., 1.00 mole) and pyrrolidine (71 g., 1.0 mole) are dissolved in 400 ml. of benzene and placed in a 1-l., one-necked flask fitted with a Dean-Stark water separator on top of which is a condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube. The reaction mixture is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, then brought to and maintained at a vigorous reflux for 45 minutes, at which time the theoretical amount of water (18 ml.) has been collected. The benzene is removed with a rotary evaporator, yielding 180 g. (98%) of highly pure ethyl β-pyrrolidinocrotonate, which may be used without distillation.
The organic layer is separated and washed twice with a total of 200 mL of water. The aqueous reaction layer is extracted five times with a total of 600 mL of chloroform. The organic extracts are washed twice with a total amount of 250 mL of water. The combined organic layers are dried with magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness. The residual solid product is carefully dried under reduced pressure to yield 48–50 g (≥ 100%).
A 500-ml. Pyrex heavy-walled, narrow-mouthed pressure bottle is charged with 100 ml. of ether and 3.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The solution is cooled with an ice bath to 5°, and 56 g. (0.42 mole) of monoethyl malonate and approximately 60 ml. (about 0.75 mole) of isobutylene are added. The bottle is immediately closed with a rubber stopper, which is clamped or wired in place, and is shaken mechanically at room temperature overnight. The bottle is chilled in an ice-salt bath and then opened. The reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask containing a cooled solution of 50 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 ml. of water and 200 g. of ice. The mixture is swirled a few times and then transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous portion is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of ether. The organic layers are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution is concentrated in a 125-ml. round-bottomed flask and distilled at reduced pressure through a 10-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction distilling at 98–100°/22 mm. or 107–109°/24 mm. is collected. The yield is 42–47 g. (53–58%), nD25 1.4128, nD23 1.4142.
A. 3,8-Dimethoxy-4,5,6,7-dibenzo-1,2-dioxacyclooctane. The ozonolysis of 10 g. (0.0562 mole) of phenanthrene in dry methanol is carried out as described in the diphenaldehyde preparation (p. 489). The reaction mixture is not reduced, however, but is acidified with 1–3 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid and allowed to stand at room temperature for an hour and then in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight. Suction filtration yields 11.5–12.5 g. (75–82%) of crystals melting at 178–181°. Trituration with methyl ethyl ketone gives a 90–95% recovery of colorless crystals melting at 180–181°.
A mixture of 200 g. (2 moles) of mesityl oxide (p. 345) and 280 cc. of aqueous ammonia (27 per cent) is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask which is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The stirrer should be inserted through a stopper in such a way that the flask is nearly air-tight. Because of the heat generated during the reaction it is desirable to keep tap water running over the flask. After stirring for several hours the system becomes homogeneous. When this point is reached the stirring is discontinued, and the well-stoppered flask is allowed to stand at room temperature for three days.
A. N-(2-Methylpropylidene)-tert-butylamine. A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with a condenser, a nitrogen inlet tube, a 50-ml. dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated through a mercury bubbler, flamed dry, and flushed with nitrogen three times. The flask is charged with 36.0 g. (0.500 mole) of tert-butylamine, and 36.5 g. (0.501 mole) of isobutyraldehyde is placed in the dropping funnel. Half of the isobutyraldehyde is added slowly through the dropping funnel before the remaining half-volume is added rapidly. The milky solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 1 hour; the water layer is then pipeted out, and excess anhydrous potassium carbonate is added. Filtration and distillation of this reaction mixture gives 32.0 g. (50%) of N-(2-methylpropylidene)-tert-butylamine, b.p. 50° (75 mm.).
F. 6-Amino-3,4-dimethyl-cis-3-cyclohexen-1-ol. A solution of 26.1 g (0.125 mol) of 4-acetyl-7,8-dimethyl-2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.3.0]non-7-en-3-one and 42.0 g (0.75 mol) of potassium hydroxide in 200 mL of methanol and 100 mL of water is refluxed for 36 hr. The resulting mixture is exhaustively extracted with diethyl ether using a liquid–liquid continuous extraction apparatus. The ethereal extract is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and the residue is taken up in 150 mL of methylene chloride. The resulting solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to dryness. The solid residue (16.5 g) is recrystallized from 100 mL of diethyl ether to give 11.2 g (64%) of colorless crystals, mp 63–65.5°C. A second crop of 2.3 g (13%) is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor to 50 mL and chilling in an ice–water bath.
A. (4-(Dimethoxymethyl)phenoxy)(tert-butyl)dimethylsilane. A 100-mL oven-dried, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, a thermocouple and an argon gas inlet is charged with tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane (6.08 g, 40.3 mmol) and DMF (20 mL). To the mixture are added 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (4.92 g, 40.3 mmol), imidazole (4.12 g, 60.5 mmol), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.248 g, 2.02 mmol) in separate portions with stirring. After being stirred for 2 h at ambient temperature (19 °C), the reaction mixture is poured into water (30 mL) in a 500-mL separatory funnel and the suspension is extracted with EtOAc (2 × 25 mL). The combined organic extracts are diluted with EtOAc (50 mL), and then washed with 5% aq. NaCl solution (100 mL), water (4 × 100 mL), and sat. aq. NaCl solution (100 mL), then are dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (1.6 g), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 °C, 30 mmHg). The residue is dissolved with toluene (50 mL) and the resulting solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 °C, 30 mmHg) to give a pale yellow oil (9.43 g). The crude product is used in the next step without further purification.
Into a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid cooled to 0° and 204 g. (1.5 moles) of pure methyl benzoate. The mixture is cooled by means of an ice bath to 0–10° and then, with stirring, there is added gradually, by means of a dropping funnel, a mixture of 125 cc. (1.96 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 125 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. During the addition of the nitrating acid, which requires about one hour, the temperature of the reaction mixture should be kept within the range 5–15°.
A mixture of 12 g. (0.50 gram atom) of magnesium turnings, 130 g. (1.0 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate, 200 g. of benzene (dried over sodium), and 120 g. (1.50 moles) of acetyl chloride is heated under reflux for 2 hours in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a condenser closed by a calcium chloride tube and supported in an oil bath (85–90°). The yellow reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the liquid portion is decanted into a separatory funnel. The residue in the flask is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of ether, and the ethereal solution is poured over ice. The ether-water mixture is then added to the benzene solution in the separatory funnel, and the mixture is shaken thoroughly; the aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The benzene-ether solution is washed once with 500 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution and once with 50 ml. of water, and finally is dried over calcium chloride. The ether and most of the benzene are removed by distillation from a water bath, and the remainder of the benzene is driven off at 50°/50 mm. The ethyl diacetylacetate is then precipitated from the residue as the copper derivative by the addition of 1.2 l. of a saturated aqueous solution of copper acetate. After addition of the copper acetate solution, the contents of the flask are shaken vigorously now and then and allowed to stand for an hour to ensure complete precipitation of the copper derivative. The blue copper derivative is filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed with two 50-ml. portions of water, and transferred directly to a separatory funnel where it is mixed with 600 ml. of ether.
A. 2-Bromoethyl methoxymethyl ether. A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a gas inlet valve. The flask is purged with argon, and charged with 125.0 g of 2-bromoethanol (1.00 mol), and 500 mL of dimethoxymethane and. The resulting mixture is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath. As a single portion, 71.0 g (0.5 mol) of solid phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) is added with stirring. The resulting mixture, which becomes quite viscous because of the insoluble P2O5, is stirred at 0°C for 10 min, then warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 7 hr during which time the viscosity of the mixture decreases. The mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, 200 mL of water is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted three times with 50 mL of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed successively with 100 mL of water and 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and carefully concentrated with a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (20–30 mm) at room temperature. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 131.3 g (78%) of 2-bromoethyl methoxymethyl ether as a colorless liquid, bp 74–78°C (40 mm).
B. (1Z,3E)-1-Phenyl-1,3-octadiene. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser to which a nitrogen inlet tube and oil bubbler are attached, a glass stopper, and an addition funnel is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 9.5 g (47 mmol) of (E)-1-hexenyl-1,3,2-benzodioxaborole and 200 mL of benzene. The solution is stirred and 8.4 g (46 mmol) of (Z)-β-bromostyrene, 50 mL of 2 M sodium ethoxide in ethanol, and finally 0.28 g (0.4 mmol) of dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) are added. The mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. The light-brown solution containing a white precipitate of sodium bromide is cooled to room temperature, treated with 60 mL of 3 M sodium hydroxide and 6 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. The organic layer is separated, washed 4 times with 50 mL of 3 M sodium hydroxide, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure to give 7.0 g (82%) of (1Z,3E)-1-phenyl-1,3-octadiene as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 80°C (0.15 mm).
B. (R)-(+)-2-Diphenylphosphinyl-2'-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (3). A dry, 500-mL, Schlenk tube is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, and flushed with nitrogen gas. The flask is charged with 25.0 g (45.4 mmol) of (R)-2,2'-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy)-1,1'-binaphthyl (2), 18.4 g (91.0 mmol) of diphenylphosphine oxide, 1.02 g (4.54 mmol) of palladium acetate, 1.94 g (4.55 mmol) of 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane (dppb), 23.4 g of diisopropylethylamine (181 mmol) and 200 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and the entire mixture is heated with stirring at 100°C for 12 hr. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, it is concentrated under reduced pressure (0.1-0.2 mm) on a rotary evaporator. The dark brown residue is diluted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed successively with water (two 100-mL portions), 5% hydrochloric acid (100 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (100 mL), and saturated sodium chloride (100 mL), and the organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate . After filtration the organic phase is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is chromatographed (14 × 30-cm column) on silica gel (ca. 1.5 kg). The column is eluted with 50% ethyl acetate-hexane and the fractions are analyzed by TLC on silica gel using the same eluant. Fractions containing the product are combined and the solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator to give 23.8 g (87%) of 3 as a white powder.
A solution of 50 g (0.127 mole) of allyltriphenyltin and in 200 ml. of diethyl ether is prepared in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a motor-driven glass sleeve-type stirrer, nitrogen-inlet tube, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel with pressure-equalizing side arm. After the system has been flushed thoroughly with prepurified nitrogen, 113 ml. of a 1.13N solution of phenyllithium (0.127 mole) in diethyl ether is added rapidly to the stirred allyltriphenyltin solution. Precipitation of tetraphenyltin occurs immediately, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes in an atmosphere of prepurified nitrogen. Through the dropping funnel is then added 12.0 g. (0.12 mole) of 4-methyl-2-pentanone in 25 ml. of diethyl ether at such a rate that moderate reflux is maintained. Subsequently the reaction mixture is refluxed for 1 hour, allowed to cool to room temperature, and hydrolyzed by adding 100 ml. of distilled water. The solid tetraphenyltin is filtered (53.5 g. = 98% yield), and the filtrate is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal extracts and the organic layer are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether by distillation at atmospheric pressure, the residue is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel into a 250-ml. distilling flask and fractionally distilled at reduced pressure using a vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column equipped with a still head of the total-condensing, partial-takeoff type. 4,6-Dimethyl-1-hepten-4-ol, b.p. 70–71°/20 mm., nD20 1.4403, is obtained in 70–75% yield (12.0–12.8 g.).
B. Phenylmagnesium bromide. Under an argon atmosphere a 2-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, pressure-equalizing, 500-mL addition funnel, thermometer, and magnetic stirring bar, is charged with magnesium turnings (25.5 g, 1.05 mol) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (130 mL). Bromobenzene (15.7 g, 0.100 mol) is then added, and the reaction is initiated by warming with a heat gun. A solution of bromobenzene (149 g, 0.95 mol) in THF (500 mL) is added at such a rate that gentle refluxing is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 1 hr with an oil bath.
The extraction with ether is continued until the ether leaving the insoluble solid is entirely colorless. This requires twenty-four to seventy-two hours, according to the state of subdivision of the nutmegs and the rate at which the ether is passed through. The ethereal solution is then freed of a small quantity of entrained insoluble matter by filtering through a folded paper. This filtration may advantageously be completed in the type of extractor described on p. 375. The clear solution is now entirely freed from ether by distillation on the water bath. The residue weighs 640–690 g. On cooling it sets to a mass of crystals of trimyristin which is filtered with suction and washed with 225 cc. of cold 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in small portions. The product is now recrystallized from 3.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; it is stirred mechanically during cooling since the trimyristin tends to separate as an oil at the outset. The crystallized trimyristin is then filtered off by suction and washed with 350-400 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol in small portions. The crystals, which are colorless and practically odorless, melt at 54–55°. The yield is 330–364 g.
C. Diethyl [(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]phosphonate . A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, thermometer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar is charged with 300 mL of acetic acid and 75.0 g (0.29 mol) of diethyl [(phenylthio)methyl]phosphonate . The dropping funnel is charged with 90 mL of an aqueous hydrogen peroxide, solution (30%) and the reaction mixture is heated under stirring to 50°C (internal temperature). The hydrogen peroxide solution is added slowly so that the internal temperature does not rise above 80°C ( Caution: This very exothermic reaction has an induction period! ). The reaction mixture is heated to 85°C for an additional 3 hr, cooled to room temperature, and transferred to a 4-L beaker. Ice (1000 g) and then a concd sodium hydroxide solution (10 M) is added until the solution is basic, pH 8-9 ( Caution: Exothermic reaction! ) The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the water phase is extracted five times with 200-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic phase is washed with 50-mL portions of aqueous sodium hydrogen sulfite solution (10%) until no oxidizing agent remains, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After removal of the magnesium sulfate by filtration, the solvents are evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Purification of the crude product by flash chromatography (5 × 30-cm column) using 1:1 diethyl ether-hexanes to elute the non-polar impurities followed by 100% ethyl acetate to elute the product provides diethyl [(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]phosphonate (76.3 g, 90%) as colorless crystals, mp 51°C.
B. p-Bromomandelic acid. In a Waring-type blender are placed 89 g. (0.25 mole) of p,α,α-tribromoacetophenone and 100–150 ml. of cold water. The mixture is stirred for 10–15 minutes, and the contents are transferred to a 1-l. wide-mouthed bottle. The mixing vessel is rinsed with 150–200 ml. of ice-cold water. The material from the rinse is combined with the mixture in the bottle, and sufficient crushed ice is added to bring the temperature below 10°. One hundred milliliters of a chilled aqueous solution containing 50 g. of sodium hydroxide is added slowly while the bottle is rotated. The contents are stored for approximately 4–5 days in a refrigerator (5°) and are shaken occasionally. During this time most of the solid dissolves, but a slight amount remains as a yellow sludge and the liquid assumes a yellow to amber color. The mixture is filtered, and the insoluble material is discarded. An excess of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate. The entire resulting mixture containing a white solid is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered into a 1-l. flask. The ether is carefully removed by distillation using a hot-water bath to give a yellow oil which solidifies when cooled. The product is recrystallized from 500 ml. of benzene. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with benzene until the filtrate is colorless. The air-dried product weighs 40–48 g. (69–83% based on p,α,α-tribromoacetophenone), m.p. 117–119°. A second recrystallization from 500 ml. of benzene is sometimes necessary.
The crude nitrile (about 290 cc.) is placed at once in a 25-cm. evaporating dish, and 425 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The hydrolysis is allowed to proceed in the cold for about twelve hours, after which the mixture is heated on a steam bath to remove the water and excess hydrochloric acid. After heating for five to six hours it is advisable to cool the mixture and filter the ammonium chloride and mandelic acid mixture that separates. The filtrate is then evaporated to dryness. This residue is added to the solid material obtained before. The product is deeply colored and must be dried in the air and light for at least twenty-four hours. The total yield of the crude mandelic acid-ammonium chloride mixture is 370–390 g., depending on the amount of moisture. The mixture of ammonium chloride and mandelic acid is ground in a mortar, transferred to a 2-l. flask, and washed twice with 750-cc. portions of cold benzene. The insoluble portion is transferred to a suction funnel and sucked dry.
In a 500-cc. distilling flask, fitted with a thermometer and an inlet tube leading to the bottom, is placed 186 g. (1 mole) of n-dodecyl alcohol. An adapter, one end of which is immersed in about 75 cc. of water contained in a 125-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, is attached to the side arm of the flask. All connections are of rubber. The alcohol is heated to 100°, and dry hydrogen bromide is passed in at 100–120° until no more absorption occurs. The crude bromide, together with any of the product that has been carried over into the receiving flask, is transferred to a separatory funnel, separated from the aqueous hydrobromic acid formed during the reaction, and shaken with one-third its volume of concentrated sulfuric acid. The lower acid layer is drawn off and discarded. The residual bromide is mixed with an equal volume of 50 per cent methyl alcohol, and aqueous ammonia is added with intermittent shaking until the solution is alkaline to phenolphthalein. The lower bromide layer is drawn off and washed once with an equal volume of 50 per cent methyl alcohol. It is then dried with calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled. The yield of product boiling at 199.5–201.5°/100 mm. or 134–135°/6 mm. is 220 g. (88 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 1000-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a rubber septum, magnetic stirring bar, and gas inlet connected to a vacuum/argon line via a Firestone valve. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. Ten cycles of evacuation and argon fill are carried out. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is charged with 6.66 mL (75 mmol) of 2-bromopropene dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (250 mL). The solution is cooled to −78°C by a dry ice/acetone bath, at which point 88 mL of 1.7 M tert-butyllithium in pentane (150 mmol) is introduced dropwise in three roughly equal portions from a 50-mL syringe during 45 min. The colorless reaction mixture is allowed to stir at −78°C for approximately 30 min.
A 500-ml., three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a two-necked adapter carrying a Friedrich condenser, and a thermometer which contacts the flask contents. The third neck of the flask carries a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel which is exchanged for a serum stopper as required. The condenser is attached to a suitable source of nitrogen. The reaction flask is placed in a heating mantle and charged with 7.75 g. (0.0767 mole) of diisopropylamine, 3.68 g. (0.082 mole) of 54% sodium hydride in mineral oil, and 75 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. From the dropping funnel, 6.6 g. (0.075 mole) of isobutyric acid is added to the stirred mixture over 5 minutes. The internal temperature rises to 50–60° and hydrogen evolution is completed by heating the mixture to reflux for 15 minutes. After cooling to 0° with an externally applied ice–salt bath, 52 ml. of a standard solution of n-butyllithium in heptane (1.45 mmole/ml.; 0.075 mole) is added through the stopper by injection at a temperature below 10°. The ice bath is retained for 15 minutes before the mixture is heated to 30–35° for 30 minutes to complete the metalation. The resulting turbid solution is cooled, and 13.9 g. (0.0751 mole) of (2-bromoethyl)benzene is added from the dropping funnel over 20 minutes at 0°. A colorless precipitate of sodium bromide begins to separate almost immediately. The ice bath is retained for 30 minutes, after which the mixture is heated to 30–35° for 1 hour.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask placed on a steam bath and fitted with a stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a reflux condenser is placed 540 g. (1.9 moles) of commercial (88 per cent) bromoform. There is then added 10 cc. of a solution of sodium arsenite made by dissolving 230 g. (1.16 moles) of c. p. arsenious oxide and 440 g. (11 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1.4 l. of water. The mixture is warmed gently to start the reaction, and then the remainder of the sodium arsenite solution is added during about one hour at such a rate that the solution refluxes gently. When the addition is complete, the flask is heated for four hours on the steam bath. The reaction mixture is distilled with steam, the lower layer of methylene bromide separated, and the water layer extracted once with 100 cc. of ether. The methylene bromide is dried with 10 g. of calcium chloride and distilled. The yield of slightly yellow liquid boiling at 97–100° is 290–300 g. (88–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. α-Bromoheptaldehyde dimethyl acetal. A solution of 156 g. (177 ml., 1 mole) of the enol acetate and 200 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is placed in a 1-l. flask and cooled in an ice-water bath. A mixture of 160 g. (51 ml., 1 mole) of bromine and 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is added slowly through a buret, the flask being constantly shaken and the rate of addition so controlled as not to allow the temperature of the brominated mixture to rise above 10°. The addition of bromine takes from 20 minutes to 1 hour, and the end point is reached when the calculated amount is absorbed and the bromine is no longer decolorized. The brominated mixture is added to 600 ml. of anhydrous methanol and allowed to stand for 48 hours or longer. At the end of this period the mixture is diluted with 2 l. of water and the separated oil (lower layer) is washed with 1 l. of water and finally with 1 l. of 5% sodium carbonate. The carbon tetrachloride and methyl acetate are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual oil is then distilled under reduced pressure in the presence of a small amount of sodium carbonate. The fraction boiling at 117–119°/17 mm. is collected as pure α-bromoheptaldehyde dimethyl acetal, nD25 1.4510–1.4520; d425 1.180–1.195. The yield is 191–203 g. (80–85%).
C. (E)-1-Iodo-4-phenyl-2-butene. A 20-ml., round-bottomed flask is charged with 2.0 g. (0.008 mole) of the thiazole prepared in Part B, 5 ml. of methyl iodide, and 2 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide. The resulting solution is heated at 75–80° for 2.5 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled, and poured into 10 ml. of water. Extraction with three 12-ml. portions of ether separates the product from water-soluble by-products. The extracts are combined, washed with 8 ml. of 1% aqueous sodium thiosulfate and two 8-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of ether by distillation at 30° (100 mm.) leaves 1.5–1.7 g. (74–82%) of (E)-1-iodo-4-phenyl-2-butene and.
C. tert-Butyl-tert-octylamine. In a dry, 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, and a nitrogen inlet are placed 25.6 g (0.20 mol) of naphthalene, 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF), and 10.8 g (0.47 mol) of sodium pieces. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. To the blue-green sodium naphthalenide solution is added the hydroxylamine mixture in 50 mL of THF over 20 min. (Caution! Exothermic reaction.) The mixture is stirred for 2.5 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is carefully decanted from excess sodium and the excess reducing agent is cautiously quenched with isopropyl alcohol. After dilution with 150 mL of hexane, the mixture is acidified with 300 mL of ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid, the aqueous layer is separated, and the organic layer extracted twice more with 100-mL portions of 2 N hydrochloric acid. The combined acidic extracts are washed with 80 mL of petroleum ether, neutralized with 4 N sodium hydroxide, and extracted with ether (3 × 100 mL). The ether extract is dried over MgSO4 and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue gives a small forerun, followed by 18–19 g of tert-butyl-tert-octylamine, bp 79°C (17 mm). The yield is 60–64% based on nitroso-tert-octane.
The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure on the steam bath, and the residue is distilled using a 200-ml. modified Claisen flask.1 The fraction boiling up to 155°/12 mm. is discarded; the anhydride is collected at 155–162°/12 mm. (170–173°/15 mm.). It amounts to 19–20 g. (78–83%).
A. Bromoacetic acid.. A mixture of 1 l. (17.5 moles, excess) of glacial acetic acid, 200ml. of acetic anhydride, and 1 ml. of pyridine is placed in a 3-l. flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser, the end of which is protected with a drying tube; the tip of the dropping funnel should reach below the level of the liquid. Some glass beads are added, and the mixture is heated to boiling. The flame is then removed, approximately 1 ml. of bromine is added, and the reaction is allowed to proceed until the liquid becomes colorless. Then the remainder of 1124 g. (360 ml., 7.03 moles) of bromine is added as rapidly as it will react; during this period (about 2.5 hours), the acid is kept boiling gently by means of a flame. After about half the bromine has been added, the liquid assumes a cherry color which is retained throughout the remainder of the bromination. After all the bromine has been added, the mixture is heated until it becomes colorless.
The clear filtrate, which has only a pale yellow color, is now run, with stirring, into the cuprous chloride solution in a 12-l. flask, while the temperature is kept at 25–30°. A somewhat sticky precipitate first forms, which later becomes crystalline; nitrogen is evolved in a continuous stream. The addition requires about thirty minutes. The mixture is then warmed on a steam bath under an efficient reflux condenser until the evolution of nitrogen ceases. It is then distilled in a current of steam (using the apparatus described on p. 479) until no more chloronitrobenzene passed over; 9–10 l. of distillate collects during this process. When quite cold, the water is decanted off, and the solid shaken with 1–2 l. of 1 per cent sodium hydroxide solution at 50°. The mixture is again allowed to cool, and the light yellow alkaline solution is decanted from the solid product, which is then collected on a filter, washed with a little cold water, dried, and distilled under reduced pressure. It boils completely at 116–117°/12 mm. or 124–125°/18 mm., and the distillate solidifies to a pale yellow solid which melts at 44–45° and weighs 430–450 g. (68–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The product is filtered, and the precipitate is extracted with a total of 1 l. of warm ether. The combined ether extracts are evaporated to a volume of 50 ml., cooled, and filtered. The filtrate is further evaporated to a volume of about 10 ml., cooled, and again filtered. The precipitates melt at 119–121° and total 7.1–9.1 g. This represents a yield of 60–77%.
The autoclave is removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature. After the coproduct, carbon dioxide , is released by the purging valve, the autoclave is opened, and the pale-yellow suspension is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. Water (120 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 60 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate (25 g), which is then filtered off and washed with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether .
A. N,N-Dichlorocyclohexylamine. In a 300-ml. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer, and calcium chloride tube are placed 9.92 g. (0.10 mole) of cyclohexylamine and 50 ml. of dry benzene, and the mixture is cooled to 0–5° by an ice bath. A solution of 24 g. (0.22 mole) of t-butyl hypochlorite3. 4 in 50 ml. of dry benzene is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 10°. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and is then stirred for 1 hour, giving a solution of N,N-dichlorocyclohexylamine suitable for use in the next step.
A solution of 320 g. (1.07 moles) of crystalline sodium dichromate (350 g. of the ordinary moist technical hydrated salt is also suitable) in 200 cc. of water is dropped from the funnel into the vigorously stirred alcohol mixture as rapidly as can be done without running the temperature above 20°. When most of the dichromate has been added, the viscosity of the reaction mixture becomes so great that the stirring is rendered inefficient. The temperature is now allowed to rise to 35° if necessary, to accelerate the reaction.
A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a three-bulbed Glinsky fractionating column connected to a water-cooled condenser set for distillation. The crude diacetone alcohol (p. 199) which will usually weigh about 1100 g. (9.5 moles) and will have a specific gravity of about 0.91 is placed in the flask together with 0.1 g. of iodine. The mixture is now distilled steadily but not too rapidly with a small free flame, and three portions are collected as follows: I, 56–80°; II, 80–126°; III, 126–131°. The first portion is acetone containing a small amount of mesityl oxide and water. The second portion separates into two layers—water and crude mesityl oxide. The third portion is pure mesityl oxide.
A. p-Toluenesulfinic acid (1). A 2-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged with 670 mL of water and 134.1 g (536 mmol) of p-toluenesulfinic acid, sodium salt and the mixture is stirred for 20-30 min until a clear solution is obtained. tert-Butyl methyl ether (TBME, 670 mL) is added followed by the slow addition of 44 mL of concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) (536 mmol) over 5 min. The mixture is stirred for an additional 20-30 min, transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is removed. The organic layer is diluted with 670 mL of toluene and concentrated with a rotary evaporator until approximately 70-90% of the solvent has been removed. Heptane (200 mL) is added and the white solid is collected by filtration using a Büchner funnel, rinsed with 270 mL of heptane and dried under vacuum for 2-4 hr to give 71-76 g (85-91%) of p-toluenesulfinic acid that is used in the next step.
In a 600-ml. beaker equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel are placed 24.6 g. (0.1 mole) of finely powdered 1,2-di-1-(1-cyano)cyclohexylhydrazine (p. 274) and 130 ml. of 90% ethanol. To this mixture is added slowly, with cooling, 45 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The beaker is placed in an ice bath, and, after the suspension has been cooled to 10°, bromine is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 15°. About 16–17 g. (about 0.1 mole) of bromine is required to reach the end point characterized by Permanent orange-yellow color. The reaction mixture is poured into 80 ml. of ice water. After 15 minutes the suspension is filtered with the aid of a Büchner funnel, washed with 250 ml. of water, and pressed dry. The solid is transferred to a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, 120 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol is added, and the crude product is dissolved as rapidly as possible while being heated on a steam bath. The solution is filtered through a fluted filter in a heated funnel, and the filtrate is placed in a refrigerator overnight. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride. The yield of product is 20.5–22.0 g. (84–90%); m.p. 113.5–115.5° and.
The reaction is carried out in 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a ball-sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The openings of the condenser and dropping funnel are protected from moisture by drying tubes. In the flask, which is protected from light, are placed 170 g. (1.1 moles) of silver nitrite and 300 ml. of absolute ether. The silver nitrite is suspended by vigorous stirring, and the mixture is cooled to 0° by an ice bath. Then 155 g. (0.5 mole) of 1,4-diiodobutane (p.321) is added dropwise over a period of 3 hours. The temperature is maintained at 0° for an additional 2 hours, and then the reaction mixture is allowed to come slowly to room temperature (25°) by permitting the ice in the cooling bath to melt. Twenty-four hours after the addition of the diiodobutane has been completed, the solution is tested for unreacted iodide. If the test is negative, the mixture is filtered and the silver iodide washed with a total of 200 ml. of benzene. The ethereal solution and the benzene washings are combined, and the solvents are distilled on a steam bath, the pressure being reduced (water aspirator) toward the end of the distillation.
The combined acid extracts are placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and refluxed for 2 hours. The hydrolysate is diluted with water to bring its volume to about 2 l. and is then subjected to distillation under reduced pressure (20–30 mm.) to remove all benzaldehyde and other volatile substances. To remove some resinous matter deposited in the course of the hydrolysis, the mixture is treated with 10 g. of Norit and filtered through a Büchner funnel. The yellow filtrate is transferred to a 3-l. beaker. It is stirred by hand with a thick glass rod while ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added through a dropping funnel until the liquid is faintly alkaline to litmus. The mixture becomes quite hot and acquires a strong odor of benzaldehyde. The amino acid separates in the form of yellow crystals. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the crystals are collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel. After washing with about 1 l. of water in small portions to remove the ammonium chloride, the solid is washed successively with 150 ml. of ethyl ether, three 50-ml. portions of hot 95% ethanol, and finally with about 500 ml. of water. The crystals, when dried by suction, weigh 220 to 240 g.. Drying is completed in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield of crude amino acid is 102–116 g. (34–39%).
Another portion of 210 g. (1.1 moles) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added and then 320 cc. of 5 N sodium hydroxide solution is slowly introduced, again keeping the temperature below 15°. Stirring is continued for four hours longer, and the oily layer is separated from the water layer and any unchanged p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. Enough petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) or benzene is added to the oil to cause it to float on water; the solution is washed thoroughly with 50 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide and dried by standing overnight over 20 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The solution is filtered, and the solvent is distilled. This is conveniently accomplished by adding the solution from a separatory funnel to a 500-cc. Claisen flask heated on a steam bath. The oily ester is then distilled under reduced pressure, and, after a forerun boiling to 170°/10 mm., the pure ester distils at 170–171°/10 mm. The yield is 250–270 g. (50–54 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a Dewar condenser connected by a T-tube to a mineral oil bubbler and a source of dry nitrogen, and a gas-inlet tube connected to a source of dry dimethyl ether is charged with 80 ml. of dichloromethane and 38.4 g. (33.3 ml., 0.271 mole) of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate. After establishing a nitrogen atmosphere in the flask, the condenser is filled with an acetone–dry ice mixture. With gentle stirring, dimethyl ether is passed into the solution until approximately 75 ml. has collected. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 28.4 g. (24.1 ml., 0.307 mole) of epichlorohydrin, which is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over a 15-minute period. The mixture is stirred overnight under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The stirrer is replaced by a filter stick, and the supernatant liquid is drawn off from the crystalline trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate, while keeping the mixture under nitrogen. The oxonium salt is washed with two 100-ml. portions of anhydrous dichloromethane and two 100-ml. portions of sodium-dried diethyl ether, and dried by passing a stream of nitrogen over the salt until the odor of ether is no longer detected, yielding 28–29 g. (92.5–96.5%) of a white crystalline solid, m.p. (sealed tube) 179.6–180.0° (dec.), and.
A. Dimethyl 2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-tartrate. (See.) In a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a large magnetic stirring bar under argon, a mixture of L-tartaric acid (101 g, 0.673 mol), 2,2-dimethoxypropane (190 mL, 161 g, 1.54 mol), methanol (40 mL), and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.4 g, 2.1 mmol) is warmed on a steam bath with occasional swirling until a dark-red homogeneous solution is obtained. Additional 2,2-dimethoxypropane (95 mL, 80.5 g, 0.77 mol) and cyclohexane (450 mL) are added and the flask is fitted with a 30-cm Vigreux column and a variable reflux distilling head. The mixture is heated to reflux with internal stirring and the acetone–cyclohexane and methanol–cyclohexane azeotropes are slowly removed. Additional 2,2-dimethoxypropane (6 mL, 5.1 g, 49 mmol) is then added and the mixture heated under reflux for 15 min. After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, anhydrous potassium carbonate (1 g, 7.2 mmol) is added and the mixture is stirred until the reddish color has abated. Volatile material is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator) and the residue is fractionally distilled under vacuum to afford the product as a pale-yellow oil, bp 94–101°C (0.5 mm); 125–135 g (0.57–0.62 mmol, 85–92% yield) and.
A mixture of 400 ml. of diethylene glycol and 49.5 g. (0.14 mole) of 1,1-di-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2,2-trichloroethane is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer. To this is added a solution of 63 g. (1.12 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 35 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and refluxed for 6 hours at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at 134–137° and. The mixture is allowed to cool and, with vigorous stirring, is poured into 1 l. of cold water. The insoluble material is filtered and washed twice with 50-ml. portions of warm water. The filtrate is then boiled gently for 5 minutes with 2 g. of Norit; the carbon is removed, the filtrate is acidified to litmus with 20% sulfuric acid (approximately 120 ml.), and then an additional 30 ml. of acid is added. The mixture is cooled to 0–5°; the precipitate is collected by filtration under suction, washed free of sulfate ions with water, and dried at 100–110°. The product is di-(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid melting at 163–165°; it weighs 27–28.5 g. (69–73%). For purification, this material is dissolved in 100 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol, the solution is filtered, and approximately 45 ml. of water is added to the boiling filtrate until it just becomes turbid. The solution is then cooled to 0–5°, and the solid is removed by suction filtration. The material weighs 25–26 g. and melts at 164–166°.
A 500 ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Trubore stirrer, a pressure-compensating dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser with drying tube. The flask is charged with 144 g. of triphenylphosphine (0.55 mole) and 125 ml. of acetonitrile and. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath and 88 g. of bromine is added dropwise over a period of 20–30 minutes. After the addition of the bromine is complete, the ice bath is removed and 72 g. (0.50 mole) of β-naphthol in 100 ml. of acetonitrile is added in one portion and the reaction mixture is heated to 60–70° for at least 30 minutes. The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, stirring is discontinued, and the acetonitrile is distilled under aspirator pressure until the oil bath temperature reaches 110°. After all the acetonitrile has been removed, the condenser is replaced by a short, large glass tube connected to a 500-ml. flask half-filled with water, and the oil bath is replaced by a Wood's metal bath. The bath temperature is now raised to 200–220° and kept at this temperature until all the solid has melted. The mixture is stirred and the bath temperature is raised to 340° and held at this temperature until evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases (approximately 20–30 minutes). The Wood's metal bath is removed and the reaction mixture is cooled to approximately 100° and then poured into a 1-l. beaker and cooled to room temperature. Pentane (300 ml.) is added and the solid is broken into a fine precipitate. The solid is filtered by suction and washed thoroughly with two 300-ml. portions of pentane. The pentane filtrates are combined, washed with 200 ml. of 20% sodium hydroxide, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The pentane extract is then passed through a 25 mm. diameter column filled to 35 cm. in depth with alumina; distillation of the pentane at reduced pressure gives 72–81 g. (70–78%) of 2-bromonaphthalene, a white solid melting at 45–50° (reported:2 55–56.4°),.
C. Hexacarbonyl[μ-[(3,4-η:3,4-η)-2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol]]dicobalt (5). A single-necked, 50-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar, is charged with dicobalt octacarbonyl (Co2(CO)8) (1.7 g, 5.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv). After attaching a rubber septum, the flask is flushed with carbon monoxide (CO), then charged with 25 mL of degassed diethyl ether. The flask is placed in an ice bath and, after 10 min, a bubbler is connected through the septum, followed immediately by the addition of 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (0.51 mL, 5.3 mmol, 1.05 eq). After removing the ice bath and stirring for 3 hr at ambient temperature, the resultant solution is filtered through a pad of Celite (diameter: 3 cm; height: 1 cm), which is washed with ether until the washes are clear (ca. 75 mL).
To the thick syrup (170–185 g.) are added 100 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate and 1.125 l. of acetic anhydride. The mixture is carefully heated to the boiling point with provision for cooling the flask with wet cloths should the acetylation become too violent. When the reaction is complete (about 20 minutes is required) the solution is poured into 10 l. of ice water. The water is decanted and renewed twice at 24-hour intervals in order to render the acetylated sugar filterable.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer, is placed a solution of 55.2 g. (0.4 mole) of isophorone and 115 ml. (1.2 moles) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide (Caution! avoid contact with skin) in 400 ml. of methanol. After the contents of the flask have been cooled to 15° by means of an ice bath, 33 ml. (0.2 mole) of 6N aqueous sodium hydroxide is added, dropwise and with stirring, over a period of 1 hour. During the addition the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 15–20° with a bath of cold water. After the addition is complete, the resulting mixture is stirred for 3 hours as the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 20–25° and. The reaction mixture is then poured into 500 ml. of water, and the resulting mixture is extracted with two 400-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are washed with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the bulk of the ether has been removed by distillation (or flash distillation) through a 30-cm. Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure, the residual liquid is distilled through the Vigreux column under reduced pressure. The yield of isophorone oxide is 43–44.5 g. (70–72%), b.p. 70–73°/5 mm., nD25 1.4500–1.4510.
The combined acid layers are distilled from a 75-cc. flask connected to an air condenser. The product is collected at 173–174°. The yield of acid is 39–44 g. (76–86 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the quantity of sec.-butyl chloride used).
The iodine monochloride solution at 5° is stirred rapidly into the anthranilic acid solution at 20°. 5-Iodoanthranilic acid separates almost immediately as a granular, tan to violet precipitate, and the reaction temperature rises to 18–22°. The mixture is stirred for an hour, while warming to room temperature, then filtered on a 13-cm. Büchner funnel. The acid is pressed as dry as possible, washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold water, and then dried at 90–100°. There is obtained 185–189 g. (88–90 per cent of the theoretical amount) of brown to purple acid which melts at 185–190°, with decomposition.
A. Tetramethyl 3,7-dihydroxybicyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,6-diene-2,4,6,8-tetracarboxylate. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a thermometer, mechanical stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, reflux condenser, and a heating mantle. A solution of 64 g (1.60 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 1.15 L of methanol is prepared in the flask, cooled in an ice bath, and stirred as 273 g (1.57 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate is added dropwise. The resulting slurry is stirred and heated to reflux, at which point the white salt dissolves. The heating mantle is removed, and the solution is stirred rapidly while 128.5 g of aqueous 40% glyoxal (51.4 g, 0.886 mol) and is added at a rate sufficient to maintain the internal temperature at 65°C. After the addition is completed (40–60 min,), the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and stirred overnight. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with 500 mL of methanol, and dried under reduced pressure. The yield of the white to light yellow disodium salt is 197–215 g (58–63%).
C. (Z)-1-Iodo-1-octene (5). A flame-dried, 250-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen, containing an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm), and fitted with three rubber septa is charged via plastic syringes with borane dimethyl sulfide complex (7.51 mL, 6.02 g, 79.2 mmol, 1.06 equiv) and diethyl ether (75 mL). The resulting stirred solution is submersed in an ice-bath for 10 min before cyclohexene (16.0 mL, 13.0 g, 158 mmol, 2.11 equiv) is added dropwise over 10 min via a 20-mL plastic syringe. A white precipitate appears within the final minute of the addition. After 15 min, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for 1 h. The reaction flask is again placed in an ice bath and, after 5 min, treated with iodoalkyne 4 (75 mmol, 17.7 g), added dropwise over 10 min via a 10-mL plastic syringe. The solution is stirred for 30 min, the ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for 1.25 h. The flask is once more immersed in the ice bath, and the mixture is allowed to stir for 15 min before a septum is removed and glacial acetic acid (30 mL) is added slowly via a 100 mL graduated cylinder. After replacing the septum, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 2.25 h. Finally, the mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (30 mL) and deionized water (50 mL). The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, shaken, and the aqueous phase is discarded. The organic phase is washed with water (3 x 50 mL), and dried over magnesium sulfate (5 g). The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration (150 mmHg), and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear oil, containing small amounts of a white precipitate. This suspension is applied to a silica plug and eluted with hexanes. Fractions containing the product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) and the resulting yellow oil is distilled under vacuum using a short-path still to give 14.28 g (80%) of iodoalkene 5 as a clear, pale-yellow liquid.
(B) Coupling: Orange II.—Seventy-two grams of β-naphthol (0.5 mole) is dissolved in the warm solution obtained by dissolving 110 g. (2.75 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 600 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask, and the solution is cooled to about 5° by the addition of 400 g. of ice. The suspension of the diazonium salt then is added and the mixture is stirred well and allowed to stand without external cooling for one hour. The azo compound soon separates from the red solution and eventually forms a stiff paste.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask provided with a Hershberg stirrer are mixed 300 ml. of water, 25 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 100 g. of 2,3-dihydropyran (p. 276). The mixture is stirred until the solution has become homogeneous and then for an additional 20 minutes. After the addition of a few drops of phenolphthalein indicator to the mixture, the acid is neutralized with 20% sodium hydroxide; enough alkali is added so that a faint pink color just persists.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 1-meter fractionating column1 are placed 450 g. (7.5 moles) of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol, 212 g. (2 moles) of u.s.p. 85 per cent lactic acid, 1 l. of benzene, and 5 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is placed in an air bath on an electric hot plate and heated until the benzene-isopropyl alcohol-water ternary mixture distils at 66.5°. Distillation is continued slowly (six to seven hours) until the temperature at the head of the column rises to and persists at 71–72° (isopropyl alcohol-benzene binary mixture), and no further separation of water occurs. Ten grams of precipitated calcium carbonate is then added to the mixture, and distillation is continued until the temperature rises to 80° in order to remove most of the benzene and excess isopropyl alcohol and. The contents of the flask are then filtered into a modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. Cuts are taken to 60°, 60–75°, 75–80°, and 80–100° at 32 mm. The fraction boiling at 75–80°/32 mm. is isopropyl lactate and weighs 130–160 g. By redistilling the high and low fractions an additional 30–60 g. is obtained, bringing the total yield to 160–180 g. (60–68 per cent of the theoretical amount). The ester may be redistilled at atmospheric pressure (with some loss due to decomposition) at 166–168°.
The mixture is poured into 750 mL of water in a 2-L separatory funnel and shaken thoroughly. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic layers are washed with 700 mL of water, followed by successive 100-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate until no further effervescence is observed. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at reduced pressure to give a yellow-orange solid, which is dissolved in 100 mL of boiling acetone and allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, then kept overnight at −20°C. Filtration affords a cream-colored solid in a yield of 51.2–52.2 g,. A second crop is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquors, dissolution in a minimal amount of boiling acetone, cooling and seeding. The total yield is brought to 58–59 g (90–92%).
A 200-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a thermometer, a glass stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 13.4 g. (0.101 mole) of durene, 4.56 g. (0.0215 mole) of periodic acid dihydrate, and 10.2 g. (0.0402 mole) of iodine. A solution of 3 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 20 ml. of water in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added to this mixture. The resulting purple solution is heated at 65–70° with stirring for approximately 1 hour until the color of iodine disappears. The reaction mixture is diluted with approximately 250 ml. of water, and the white-yellow solid that separates is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed three times with 100-ml. portions of water. The product is dissolved in a minimum amount of boiling acetone (about 125 ml. is required); the solution is cooled to room temperature and subsequently stored overnight in a refrigerator. The product is collected by rapid filtration through a Büchner funnel, yielding 20.8–22.6 g. (80–87%) of iododurene as colorless, fine needles, m.p. 78–80°.
A. , (R∗,R∗)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine(R∗,R∗) and (R∗,S∗)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine.2,3 A three-necked, 500-mL flask equipped with three quartz refluxing columns and three water condensers is charged with pyrrolidine (160 mL) and a drop of mercury. The water condensers are equipped with gas inlets connected to a single nitrogen source leading to an oil bubbler. The flask is placed in a Rayonet Photoreactor fitted with 14 × 8 Watt low pressure Hg lamps (254 nm). The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with a heating mantle. The lamps are turned on, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 7 days. After the lamps are turned off, the system is allowed to cool to room temperature. The liquid is then carefully decanted to a distillation flask and the mercury is recovered. Unreacted pyrrolidine and side products are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residue is distilled to provide 67.6 g (50%) of a mixture of (R∗,R∗) and (R∗,S∗)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear, light yellow liquid (bp 79–81 °C at 3.0 mmHg). The product is of sufficient purity to be used in the resolution step.
A wide-mouthed 250-cc. flask containing a mixture of 50 g. (0.25 mole) of technical 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and 18 g. (0.23 mole) of ammonium acetate is half immersed in an oil bath. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and an inlet tube, the lower end of which is at least 2 cm. wide (to prevent clogging) and which nearly touches the surface of the reaction mixture. During the operation ammonia gas is introduced through a bubble counter which contains a small amount of strong potassium hydroxide solution (12 g. of potassium hydroxide in 10 cc. of water).
A dry 12-l. three-necked flask is equipped with an efficient motor-driven stirrer, a nitrogen inlet tube, a large Allihn condenser, and a 1-l. separatory funnel. Both the condenser and the funnel are provided with calcium chloride drying tubes. To the flask is added 146 g. (6 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings, and nitrogen gas, first bubbled through concentrated sulfuric acid, is passed in to displace the air. During the reaction the nitrogen atmosphere is maintained. The magnesium is covered with 200 ml. of anhydrous ether, and a few milliliters of a solution of 852 g. (6 moles) of methyl iodide in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added from the separatory funnel. The reaction starts spontaneously, and then the remainder of the methyl iodide solution is added slowly. When the reaction is complete, 4 l. of dry benzene is added, a condenser is arranged for downward distillation, and about 1.2 l. of solvent is distilled. The condenser is changed to a reflux position, 609 g. (3 moles) of 9-cyanophenanthrene (p. 212) is added quickly through a powder funnel, and the mixture is heated and stirred under reflux for 3 hours. It is then cooled in an ice bath to 0°, 3 l. of cold 6 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added (Caution!) from a separatory funnel with stirring, and the mixture is refluxed for 6 to 8 hours.
The oily layer is separated from the aqueous layer, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts and oil are dried over calcium chloride. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is distilled on a water bath; finally, all low-boiling material is removed from the mixture on a boiling water bath under the lowest pressure obtainable with a water pump. The nitrosoaminoketone which remains in the flask is sufficiently pure for the preparation of diazomethane. The yield is 221–257 g. (70–80% based on mesityl oxide).
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 900 g. of 3 per cent sodium amalgam, 180 g. (1.15 moles) of bromobenzene, 200 cc. of dry toluene or dry xylene, and 10 cc. of ethyl acetate. The mixture is refluxed with frequent shaking for twelve hours in an oil bath at 130°.
The mixture is distilled using an efficient fractionating column. There is a large fore-run of chloroform, pyridine, and water, after which the temperature rises and 145–167 g. of material, b.p. 145–165°/760 mm., is collected. This is refractionated, and 135–155 g. (33–38%) of 4-ethylpyridine, b.p. 163–165°/760 mm., n20D 1.5010, is obtained.
A. 4-Dimethylamino-2'-methoxybenzhydrol. An ethereal solution of o-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide is prepared in the usual manner2 with 250 ml. of anhydrous ether, 14.5 g. (0.60 g. atom) of magnesium, and 100 g. (0.53 mole) of o-bromoanisole. A solution of 60 g. (0.40 mole) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in 200 ml. of anhydrous benzene is added dropwise to the Grignard reagent. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred for 10 hours at room temperature. The magnesium complex, which forms a very thick suspension, is decomposed with a solution of 75 g. of ammonium chloride in 450 ml. of water. The ether-benzene layer is separated, washed with 100 ml. of water, and dried over calcium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is induced to crystallize by trituration with a little petroleum ether (30–60°). Recrystallization of the solid from benzene-petroleum ether (30–60°) gives 4-dimethylamino-2'-methoxybenzhydrol (59–60 g., 57–58%), m.p. 75–80°.
The solid reaction product is cooled in ice water and decomposed by addition of an ice-cold solution of 20 g. of potassium carbonate in 250 ml. of water, cooling being continued throughout. The mixture is extracted three times with 35-ml. portions of ether; the ether extract is dried over calcium chloride and then distilled. The ester is obtained from the fraction boiling at 85–98° by fractional distillation by means of a good column. The purified ester boils at 95–97°/740 mm. and weighs 37–45 g. (45–55%).
Finely ground iodosobenzene diacetate2 (32.2 g., 0.10 mole) is placed in a 250-ml. beaker, and 150 ml. of 3N sodium hydroxide is added over a 5-minute period with vigorous stirring. The lumps of solid that form are triturated with a stirring rod or spatula for 15 minutes, and the reaction mixture stands for an additional 45 minutes to complete the reaction. One hundred milliliters of water is added, the mixture is stirred vigorously, and the crude, solid iodosobenzene is collected on a Büchner funnel. The wet solid is returned to the beaker and triturated in 200 ml. of water. The solid is again collected on the Büchner funnel, washed there with 200 ml. of water, and dried by maintaining suction. Final purification is effected by triturating the dried solid in 75 ml. of chloroform in a beaker. The iodosobenzene is separated by filtration and air-dried; weight 18.7–20.5 g. (85–93%); m.p. 210° (Caution! Explodes!). Iodometric titration3 shows the product to be more than 99% pure.
A. (E, E)-Farnesyl bromide. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two rubber septa, and a nitrogen inlet connected to a mineral oil bubbler, is charged with 10.0 g (11.3 mL, 45.0 mmol) of (E, E)-farnesol and 150 mL of THF. The solution is stirred and cooled in a dry ice/acetonitrile bath (temperature −45 °C to −47 °C), while methanesulfonyl chloride (6.70 g, 4.53 mL, 58.5 mmol) is added through one septum via syringe over 5 min. Triethylamine (9.10 g, 12.6 mL, 89.9 mmol) is then added through one septum by syringe over 5 min. A white solid precipitates during the addition, and the resulting suspension is stirred at −45 °C to −47 °C for 45 min. A room temperature solution of lithium bromide (15.6 g, 180 mmol) in 50 mL of THF is prepared in a separate flask and added by cannula transfer over 5 min. The dry ice/acetonitrile bath is removed, and the suspension is allowed to warm to 0 °C with an ice-bath. The yellowish mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 h. The reaction mixture is poured into 300 mL of ice water. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with three 150-mL portions of cold diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts are sequentially washed with ice-cold saturated NaHCO3 (200 mL) and brine (200 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation and vacuum drying to give 11.6 g of (E, E)-farnesyl bromide as a light yellow oil which is used in the next step without purification.
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a vacuum adapter and two glass stoppers is charged with 21.4 g (0.246 mol) of anhydrous lithium bromide and 35.3 g (0.246 mol) of anhydrous cuprous bromide. The reaction vessel is evacuated and the contents are briefly heated with a Bunsen burner flame. After 30 min the vacuum is replaced by nitrogen and the apparatus is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and two rubber septa. Dry tetrahydrofuran (260 mL) is added, and the resulting green solution containing a small amount of undissolved solid is cooled with an ice bath while 84 mL of a 2.8 M solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran is added rapidly via syringe over 1–2 min. After 20 min of further stirring at 0°C, the reaction mixture appears as a viscous yellow-green suspension. The solution of the mesylate derivative of 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propyn-1-ol prepared above is now transferred via cannula over 45 min to the reaction mixture, which is cooled below −70°C with a dry ice–acetone bath. After 30 min, the cold bath is removed and the green reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The blue-gray mixture is then poured into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetically stirred mixture of 400 mL of pentane, 200 mL of water, and 400 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The organic phase is separated and washed successively with two 200-mL portions of saturated ammonium chloride solution, ten 1-L portions of water, and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the drying agent is removed by filtration. The solvent is removed from the filtrate by atmospheric distillation through a 10-cm Vigreux column. The residual liquid is carefully distilled through a 12-cm column packed with glass helices to give 21.3–22.2 g, (72–75%) of 1-methyl-1-(trimethylsilyl)allene as a colorless liquid, bp 111°C,(Note 9),(Note 10)(Note 11).

The mixture is stirred and cooled with a dry ice–acetone cooling bath at −40°C. To the stirred mixture is added dropwise 11.5 mL (0.103 mol) of titanium tetrachloride over 15 min. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at 5°C (cold room) for 3 days under a nitrogen atmosphere. The dark-gray slurry is cooled with an ice–water bath and 50 mL of dry dichloromethane is added. To the stirred mixture is added 15.4 g (0.1 mol) of (+)-isomenthone in 50 mL of dry dichloromethane over a period of 10 min. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at room temperature (20°C) for 1.5 hr. The mixture is diluted with 300 mL of pentane and a slurry of 150 g of sodium bicarbonate in 80 mL of water is added cautiously over 1 hr. The clear organic solution is poured of into a 1.5-L Erlenmeyer flask and the residue is washed 3 times with 50-mL portions of pentane. The combined organic solutions are dried over a mixture of 100 g of sodium sulfate and 20 g of sodium bicarbonate and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (No. 2), and the solid desiccant is thoroughly washed with pentane. The solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure by flash distillation through a column (40 × 2.5 cm) packed with glass helices.

A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a stirrer, a thermometer for reading low temperatures, and a condenser, to the upper end of which is attached a tube for disposing of the hydrogen chloride evolved. A mixture of 200 cc. of carbon disulfide and 180 g. (1.35 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is placed in the flask which is then immersed in an ice-salt freezing mixture and stirred very vigorously until the temperature of the mixture is −5° or below. A mixture of 175 g. (1.3 moles) of p-cymene and 110 g. (100 cc., 1.4 moles) of acetyl chloride is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 5°. This addition requires about three and one-third hours. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight and is then poured upon 1 kg. of cracked ice to which 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. The mixture is extracted with three 700-cc. portions of ether; the ether solution is dried over anhydrous calcium chloride and distilled at ordinary pressure from a Claisen flask provided with an indented column, until the temperature reaches 190°. The material that remains in the flask is fractionally distilled twice under diminished pressure. The principal fraction is aceto-p-cymene, a pale yellow oil boiling at 124–125°/12 mm. (155–157°/30 mm.). It weighs 115–125 g. (50–55 per cent of the theoretical amount). About 50 g. of cymene is recovered, and there is a small amount (10–12 g.) of residual oil left in the flask.
B. N-[(Phenyl)methylene]-P,P-diphenylphosphinic amide (3). A flame-dried 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with 2 (18.00 g, 39.00 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (26.95 g, 195.0 mmol). The flask is purged with argon and anhydrous acetonitrile (365 mL) is added via cannula under argon at room temperature. The resulting suspension is vigorously stirred under argon at room temperature for 12 h. The reaction mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel and the residue is washed with acetonitrile (50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated at 30 °C by rotary evaporation (30–50 mmHg) to afford 10.88 g (91% yield) of the title compound as an off-white solid.
The crude bromoethylphthalimide is extracted from the potassium bromide by refluxing with 300 cc. of alcohol (98–100 per cent) until the dark oil is entirely dissolved. This requires about one-half. hour. The hot solution is filtered with suction, and the residue of salt is washed with a little hot alcohol. The alcohol is distilled under reduced pressure, and the dry residue is refluxed with 500 cc. of carbon disulfide for about fifteen minutes in order to separate the soluble bromoethylphthalimide from the insoluble diphthalimidoethane. The warm solution is filtered with suction. The carbon disulfide is distilled under diminished pressure. The bromoethylphthalimide remains as light tan crystals which melt at 78–80°. The yield is 140–160 g. (69–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a drying tube is charged with 94.9 g. (1.20 moles) of pyridine and 1.5 l. of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred with ice-bath cooling to an internal temperature of 5°, and 60.0 g. (0.600 mole) of chromium trioxide is added in one portion. The deep burgundy solution is stirred in the cold for an additional 5 minutes, then allowed to warm to 20° over a period of 60 minutes. A solution of 15.8 g. (0.100 mole) of 1-decanol in 100 ml. of dichloromethane is added rapidly, with immediate separation of a tarry, black deposit. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes and decanted from the tarry residue, which is washed with three 500-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic solution is washed successively with three 1-l. portions of ice-cold, aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide, 1 l. of ice-cold, 5% hydrochloric acid, 1 l. of aqueous 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 1 l. of saturated brine. The solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting pale yellow liquid is distilled through a 15-cm., vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column, yielding 9.8–10.2 g. (63–66%, of 1-decanal, b.p. 96–98° (13 mm.).
A. N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone.2 3 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet adaptor, a low temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (1.1 L) and triphenylphosphine (42.1 g, 160 mmol,). The triphenylphosphine is dissolved with stirring and the flask is then cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath. Distilled dimethyl azodicarboxylate (17.7 mL, 160 mmol, d = 1.33 g/mL at 25°C) is added dropwise with a syringe over 10 min (Caution,). The resulting pale yellow solution is stirred at −75° to −78°C for 10 min, at which point a milky white slurry is obtained. The rubber septum on the flask is quickly replaced with a 1-L, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine (38.3 g, 160 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (240 mL),, which is added dropwise to the mixture over 30 min. After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at −75° to −77°C for 20 min, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is slowly warmed with stirring to room temperature over 2.5 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 35°C. The residual pale yellow syrup is dried briefly (15 min) under high vacuum (~0.2 mm) and suspended in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 20 mL). Ethyl acetate (30 mL) is added to give a solution which is applied to a 10 × 23-cm column of flash silica gel4 (800 g) packed in hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1). The flask and the sides of the column are rinsed with additional ethyl acetate (20 mL), and this is added to the column which is then eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (4/1, 2.6 L). The solvent is changed to hexane/ethyl acetate (3/2) and 500-mL fractions are collected. Concentration of fractions 6–10 on a rotary evaporator gives 15.5 g (44%) of analytically pure N-(benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone. Fractions 11–14 contain slightly impure β-lactone. The solid obtained from concentration of these fractions on a rotary evaporator is dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL) and precipitated by addition of hexane (50 mL) followed by cooling to −20°C (0.5 hr). The process is repeated twice to afford additional β-lactone (1.25 g). The total yield is 16.8 g (47%).
If an emulsion has formed, it may be broken by acidifying with hydrochloric acid, whereupon two clear layers are obtained. The benzene solution may be dried and then fractionated or, preferably, it may be steam distilled. In the latter case it is transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, the flask is set in an oil bath, and the benzene distilled. Steam is then passed in, and after the last of the benzene is removed, the p-bromobiphenyl distils with the steam. The temperature of the oil bath is held at 170° in order to hasten the distillation. The product solidifies in the condenser and receiving flask. There is obtained 23–24 g. of p-bromobiphenyl which melts at 85–86.5°.
A 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer is charged with 255 g. (2.0 moles) of o-chloroaniline, 106 g. (2.0 moles) of acrylonitrile, and 10.2 g. (4.0% by weight of the amine) of cupric acetate monohydrate. The mixture is then stirred and heated to reflux, beginning at about 95°. Refluxing is continued for 3 hours, with the pot temperature rising to about 130°.
The hydrogen sulfide addition is temporarily suspended, and 100 ml. of pyridine is added rapidly in one portion through the condenser as the solution is stirred vigorously. The solution becomes clear, and then 2,5-diamino-3,4-dicyanothiophene begins to precipitate immediately. The hydrogen sulfide addition is resumed and is continued for about 30 minutes while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 0–5°. Finally, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes at 0–5°, then the yellow precipitate of the thiophene is collected on a Büchner funnel, thoroughly washed with about 500 ml. of acetone, and dried in the air or in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of crude product of yellow or buff color amounts to 30–31 g. (92–95%).
B. Ethyl 5-(tert-butyl)-2-phenyl-1-tosyl-3-pyrroline-3-carboxylate ( 2 ). A flame-dried, 1-L 3-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (Teflon paddle, 6 × 2 × 0.3 cm), temperature probe, and a nitrogen inlet, is charged with (E)-N-benzylidene-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (7.80 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and purged with argon. Benzene (300 mL) is added to the flask via syringe, and the mixture is stirred until a homogeneous solution is achieved. Tributylphosphine (1.5 mL, 6.0 mmol, 0.20 equiv) is added via syringe and the reaction mixture is stirred for 5 min. Ethyl 5,5-dimethylhexa-2,3-dienoate (1) (6.06 g, 36.0 mmol, 1.20 equiv) is added over 5 min using a syringe pump. The reaction is monitored using TLC. Upon completion, the mixture is transferred into a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated under rotary evaporation (30 °C, 20-25 mmHg) to a thick orange/brown oil and placed under high vacuum for 10 min (0.1-0.2 mmHg) to ensure the removal of residual solvent. A sample of the crude oil (est. 0.5 g) is purified by column chromatography to afford seed crystals of 2. A mixture of hexanes/ethyl acetate (9:1, 75 mL) is added to the crude oil in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and a reflux condenser is attached. A Teflon-coated stir bar is added and the crude residue is dissolved by heating in an oil bath with stirring until a homogeneous solution is achieved. After cooling to room temperature, the reflux condenser is removed and the flask is capped with a plastic stopper and left to stand overnight. The seed crystals are added as the reaction mixture is cooled. The following day the mixture is placed in a freezer at -20 °C for 2 h. The crystals that precipitated are collected under vacuum filtration using a glass-fritted funnel. The crystals are rinsed with hexanes (200 mL) to give 11.4-11.8 g (88-92% yield) of 2 as a white to pale yellow solid.
The crude product is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column (the receiving flask is cooled in an ice–water bath) to yield 22.45–22.84 g (80–81%) of (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a colorless liquid, bp 31–33°C (0.30–0.40 mm). Analysis by GC indicates a chemical purity of 89–93%. The material is fractionally distilled through a 20-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to obtain 17.69–19.44 g (63–69%), [α]D22 −38.1 to −38.6° (neat), [α]D23 −46.2 to −48.6° (CHCl3, c 1.0) of a colorless liquid. Analysis by GC indicates a chemical purity of 96–98%. An enantiomeric purity of 96.4–97.5% is determined by 1H NMR analysis of the derived acetate using Eu(hfc)3, tris[3-(heptafluoropropylhydroxymethylene)-d-camphorato] europium(III), as the chiral shift reagent. The enantiomeric purity may also be determined by GC analysis of the derived α-methoxy-α-(trifluoromethyl)phenylacetic acid esters3 and. An alternative to the distillation method is purification by preparative HPLC and and bulb-to-bulb distillation to give 21.85 g (78%) of (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a white solid, mp 19°C, [α]D25 −46.6° (CHCl3, c 1.0). Analysis by GC of material purified in this manner indicates a chemical purity of >99% and an enantiomeric purity of 96.8%,(Note 21),(Note 22).
Into the tared flask are placed 126.5 g. (1 mole) of p-chlorotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 170) and 3.8 g. of phosphorus pentachloride. The flask is heated in a bath kept at 160–170°, and while illuminated with direct sunlight or with an unfrosted 100-watt tungsten lamp a rapid stream of chlorine is introduced directly from a cylinder until the gain in weight is 55–66.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask with mechanical stirrer and vacuum outlet is charged with powdered cerium (III) chloride (CeCl3 · 7H2O, 52.92 g, 0.142 mol). The flask is immersed to the necks in an oil bath and evacuated to 0.2 mm. The solid is agitated by stirring as the flask is heated to 150°C for 2 hr. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, it is vented to the atmosphere and quickly purged with a stream of dry nitrogen for 2 min. At this stage, the flask is fitted with a low-temperature thermometer and a graduated 250-mL addition funnel containing 300 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF), and capped with a rubber septum. Connection to a dry nitrogen line with a pressure relief bubbler is made via a needle through the septum. Tetrahydrofuran is run into the flask with good stirring, so that an even suspension results. The white suspension is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. Meanwhile, the addition funnel is charged with trimethylsilylmethylmagnesium chloride (Me3SiCH2MgCl, 1 M solution in ethyl ether, 142 mL, 0.142 mol) and, transferred via stainless-steel cannula. The contents of the flask are cooled to −65°C with a dry ice/2-propanol bath, and the Grignard solution is added dropwise over a period of 40–50 min, so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below −60°C. The addition funnel is removed from the setup, with the septum/nitrogen inlet connected directly to the flask. After the cold mixture is stirred for 15 min more, ethyl cinnamate (10.32 g, 0.0586 mol) is added via syringe over a 2–3-min period. Stirring is continued as the flask is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature. The off-white to beige reaction mixture is cooled to <5°C (ice-water bath) and quenched by the portionwise addition of chilled 1 M hydrochloric acid (200 mL), so that the internal temperature remains below 20°C. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with ethyl ether (100 mL each). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvents are removed at a rotary evaporator (25°C at 60 mm). The residual oil is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and distilled bulb-to-bulb. The product (9.69–9.85 g, 76.5–78%) is collected at an air-bath temperature of 110–112°C, 0.20 mm.
The residue is dissolved in ethanol (250 mL), a 1 M aqueous solution of tetrabutylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (80 mL) is added, and the mixture is stirred under reflux for 24 hr. After the solution is cooled, it is partly evaporated on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature not exceeding 40°C to remove most of the ethanol. Water is added (500 mL) and the solution is extracted twice with chloroform (200 mL). The chloroform extracts are washed with a 1 : 1 mixture of brine and 1 N hydrochloric acid and then with brine and saturated sodium bicarbonate solutions. Both aqueous phases are extracted twice with chloroform and the extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness to give 5.8 g of crude 4,4-disubstituted cyclohexenone. The product is distilled rapidly in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 3.5 mm and 115°C to give 3.0 g (77%) of highly pure cyclohexenone.

The bottle is shaken until all the casein is moistened. A solution of 60 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 6 g. of sodium fluoride in 1 l. of water at 37° is added. A thin paste of 20 g. of commercial pancreatin in 100 cc. of water (37°) is poured in. The mixture is covered with a layer of toluene (80 cc.), diluted to 6 l., stoppered, shaken thoroughly, and placed in a warm room or bath at 37°.
To the residue is added 600 ml. of ethylene glycol, followed by 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid.

To this material is added a solution prepared from 325 g. of potassium hydroxide, 300 ml. of water, and 300 ml. of 95% ethanol. The resultant solution is heated under reflux for 1 hour, and then cooled and transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, where it is diluted with 3 l. of water and acidified with 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The organic liquid which separates is diluted with 300 ml. of hexane and separated from the aqueous layer, which is extracted three additional times with 300-ml. portions of hexane. The hexane extracts are washed to pH 4 with three 300-ml. portions of water, and then combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. For removal of solvent by flash distillation, a 150-ml. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a ground joint attached to a distillation head and side tubulature attached to a dropping funnel, is heated by an oil bath whose temperature is maintained at 130–140°. After all the solution has been added at about the rate of distillation, the dropping funnel is replaced by a capillary, and the last of the solvent is removed at reduced pressure furnished by a water pump. The flask is finally attached to an efficient fractionating column, and the residue of mixed α,β-unsaturated acid and γ-lactone is distilled carefully at reduced pressure.

Cyclohexanone (40.0 g, 0.41 mol) is added and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for 48 hr. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the contents are poured into 600 mL of pentane. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with three 500-mL portions of cold aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic layer is washed rapidly in succession with 200 mL of cold 1.5N hydrochloric acid and 200 mL of cold aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The pentane solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The crude product is distilled through a short Vigreux column to give 53–54 g (76–77%) of 1-trimethylsiloxycyclohexene as a colorless liquid, bp 75–80°C (20–21 mm).
A. Sodium β-trimethylsilylethanesulfonate (1) . To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added vinyltrimethylsilane (28.0 mL, 18.2 g, 181 mmol), methanol (70 mL), and tert-butyl perbenzoate (0.70 mL, 0.70 g, 3.6 mmol),(Note 3),(Note 4). To this solution is added a solution of sodium bisulfite, NaHSO3, (36.1 g, 347 mmol) in 70 mL of water,(Note 6),(Note 7). The flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter bearing an immersion thermometer and reflux condenser, and the resulting suspension is heated in an oil bath at 50°C under argon for 48 hr. The suspension is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and followed by azeotropic removal of the residual water with methanol (2 × 25 mL). Methanol (200 mL) is added to the resulting white solid, and the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously for 10 min. The mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The filter cake is resuspended in 200 mL of methanol and stirred vigorously for 10 min, filtered into the vessel containing the original filtrate, and further concentrated. The preceding operations are repeated again on the filter cake. After the final concentration of the combined filtrates, the resulting white solid is dried (100°C and 0.1 mm) for 12 hr to give 29.0-31.9 g (~78-86%) of crude sodium β-trimethylsilylethanesulfonate as white flakes with mp >310°C.
A solution of 196 g. (1 mole) of cyclohexanone diallyl acetal, 150 g. of toluene, and 0.10 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid is distilled through a good fractionating column. In about 3 hours, 110 g. of distillate boiling at 91–92° is obtained and the temperature in the head then rises abruptly. The residue in the distilling flask is cooled and washed with 5 ml. of aqueous potassium carbonate to remove the acid. The remaining solution is passed through a filter containing anhydrous powdered magnesium sulfate and returned to the still. Most of the remaining toluene is removed by distillation at 100 mm. pressure (b.p. 52°). The receiver is changed, the pressure is reduced to 15 mm., and the last of the toluene is collected in a cold trap. The residual oil is rapidly vacuum-distilled to separate the product from a higher-boiling residue. Redistillation yields 117–126 g. (85–91%) of 2-allylcyclohexanone, b.p. 86–88°/15 mm., nD25 1.4670.
To the above aqueous solution, contained in a 2-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask, is added 85 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and is cooled in an ice-salt mixture. With stirring, 75 cc. of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide (Merck's "Superoxol") diluted with 75 cc. of water is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 15°. After standing for about ten hours at room temperature (preferably overnight) the solution is acidified by the cautious addition of 450 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The warm acid solution is extracted with one 400-cc. portion and two 200-cc. portions of warm benzene. The combined benzene extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered through a cotton plug into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask.
A 2-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 86.0 g. (105 ml., 1.00 mole) of 3-methyl-2-butanone and 600 ml. of anhydrous methanol. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice–salt bath to 0–5°, and 160 g. (54.6 ml., 1.00 mole) of bromine is added in a rapid, steady stream from the dropping funnel. During this time, the temperature is allowed to rise but not permitted to exceed 10°. The reaction temperature is maintained at 10° during the remaining reaction time. The red color of the solution fades gradually in about 45 minutes, 300 ml. of water is then added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.
A dry, 250-ml., three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a glass stopper, and a rubber septum through which are inserted hypodermic needles used to evacuate the flask and to admit nitrogen. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 4.19 g. (0.0220 mole) of purified copper(I) iodide is added, and while warming with a flame, the apparatus is evacuated, then refilled with nitrogen. After this procedure has been performed twice, the flask is allowed to cool, the stopper is replaced with a thermometer, and 45 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added with a hypodermic syringe. With continuous stirring, 22 ml. of 1.0 M (0.022 mole) lithium thiophenoxide solution is added with a syringe to the slurry of copper(I) iodide. After 5 minutes, the resulting yellow solution is cooled, with continuous stirring, to −65° with an acetone–dry ice cooling bath. Some copper(I) thiophenoxide usually separates from solution at ca. −45°. When the temperature of the mixture has reached ca. −65°, 13.6 ml. (0.0218 mole) of 1.60 M tert-butyllithium solution is added with a syringe to the stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture remains at −60° to −65°. The resulting cloudy yellow-orange solution of the cuprate reagent is stirred at −60° to −65° for 5 minutes.
C. 4-Hydroxymethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one , 4. ( Caution: Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is extremely toxic!) A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with amino alcohol 3 (16.0 g, 0.056 mol) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (300 mL). The flask is cooled to 5°C in an ice-water bath. A 4.0 M solution of HF in THF (32 mL, 0.128 mol) is added over 15 min to the cold solution of the amino alcohol. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 hr. THF is removed on a rotary evaporator, maintaining the bath temperature below 40°C. Ethyl acetate (250 mL) is added, and the organic layer is washed with 1.2 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution (40 mL). The aqueous layer is reextracted with ethyl acetate (5 × 100 mL each). Solid sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) (15 g) is added to the combined organic layers, followed by stirring for 1 hr and subsequent addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). The solution is filtered and solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford the crude enone, which is further purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (0.2 mm, oven temperature 140-180°C, Note 6) to give 5.90 g (84%) of 4-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one as a viscous pale-yellow oil.
At the end of this time the mixture is cooled somewhat, and 100 g. of decolorizing carbon and 150 g. of infusorial earth or fuller's earth are added, and refluxing is resumed for one-half hour. The solution is filtered hot with suction through a Büchner funnel previously heated by blowing steam into the side neck of the suction flask. The cake is washed with 500 cc. of hot absolute methyl alcohol. The filtration is likely to be slow unless a large funnel (30 cm.) is used. The light yellow filtrate soon begins to deposit crystals. It is kept in an ice box twenty to fifty hours. The crystals are filtered by suction, washed with 50 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol, then with 50 cc. of dry acetone, and dried on porous plates at room temperature. The yield is 480–520 g. The mannoside is pure enough for most chemical purposes. It melts at about 170° and has a rotation in water of + 78.6°. If a purer product is desired, the mannoside may be crystallized from four parts of 80 per cent ethyl alcohol with 80–90 per cent recovery if the mother liquors are worked up. Slight acidity in the solution used in recrystallization should be carefully neutralized with ammonia. The recrystallized mannoside melts at 188–189° and has a rotation of [α]20D + 80.8°.
After all the bromine has been added, the heating and stirring are continued for ten minutes. While still liquid, the contents of the flask are poured into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing 4 l. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–100°), and 15 g. of Norite is added. The material is brought into solution by heating on an electric hot plate, and, after boiling for ten minutes, the solution is filtered rapidly with suction. After cooling to 20°, the crystals are filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and washed with two 50-cc. portions of cold ligroin. The crude product, m.p. 94–97°, weighs 280–315 g. (59–66 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is sufficiently pure for some purposes.
While the bromostyrene is being dropped in, the temperature of the oil bath is raised very gradually to 215–220° and is kept there until all the bromostyrene has been added. Finally the temperature is raised to 230° and is held there until no more distillate comes over. The distillate is colorless; it consists of two layers, the lower one being water. The upper layer is separated and dried with solid potassium hydroxide. It is then distilled. The yield of the distilled phenylacetylene, boiling at 142–144°, is 37 g. (67 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. (E)-1-Dimethylamino-3-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-1,3-butadiene , 2. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a pressure equalizing addition funnel, a large egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, and a nitrogen/vacuum adapter. The apparatus is evacuated and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with a 1.0 M solution of sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (NaHMDS) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) (100 mL, 0.100 mol) and the flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−70°C bath temp), causing a viscous, yellowish-white suspension to form. To this suspension is added, over a period of 30 min via an addition funnel, a solution of (E)-4-dimethylamino-3-buten-2-one (11.3 g, 0.100 mol) in THF (50 mL). The funnel is rinsed with a small amount of THF, and the resulting clear-yellow solution is stirred for 1.0 hr at −78°C. A solution of tert-butylchlorodimethylsilane (15.8 g, 0.105 mol) in THF (50 mL) is added over a 5-min period, via an addition funnel. The funnel is again rinsed with a small amount of THF. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to reach room temperature, which requires about 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask containing 600 mL of anhydrous ether. The resulting suspension is allowed to stand for 30 min and then suction filtered through a pad of dry Celite (60 g) packed in a 600-mL sintered glass filter funnel. The filter cake is washed with three 50-mL portions of ether, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (heating bath temp <45°C). The resulting dark orange oil, containing the diene and hexamethyldisilazane, is subjected to bulb-to-bulb distillation (110-120°C, 0.3 mm) to yield 20.4 g (90%) of the desired 1-amino-3-siloxy-1,3-butadiene as a light-yellow oil.
B. Lithium dibutylcuprate . A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a thermometer, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a nitrogen inlet is charged with freshly recrystallized copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (10.2 g, 49.5 mmol) and anhydrous diethyl ether (85 mL). To this suspension, cooled to −80°C in a liquid nitrogen-ethyl acetate bath, is added dropwise via syringe during 20 min a solution of n-butyllithium (44.4 mL, 99 mmol, 2.23 M solution in hexanes). When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is placed in an ice bath and stirred at 0-3°C for 6 min to give a brown solution of lithium dibutylcuprate .
B. Coumarilic acid. In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser, 450 g. (8 moles) of solid potassium hydroxide is dissolved in 700 ml. of absolute ethanol. The solution is cooled to 15° by immersing the flask in an ice bath, and 215 g. (0.7 mole) of finely divided coumarin dibromide is added in 10- to 15-g. portions to the well-stirred basic solution. The rate of addition is controlled so that the temperature never rises above 20°; the addition requires about 30 minutes. After all the dibromide has been added, the reaction mixture is refluxed, with stirring, for 30 minutes. One and a half liters of water is added, and the resulting solution is steam-distilled until 2.5 l. of distillate has been collected. The residue is cooled to room temperature by the addition of 1 kg. of cracked ice and is then acidified by the addition of 1.2 l. of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The crude coumarilic acid is collected on a filter and stirred with 600 ml. of cold water. The acid is separated from the water by filtration, sucked as dry as possible on the filter, and then crystallized from a mixture of 250 ml. of ethanol and 250 ml. of water. The recrystallized coumarilic acid is colorless, weighs 93–100 g. (82–88%), and melts at 190–193°.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 36.0 g. (0.132 mole) of 2-(p-tolylsulfonyl)dihydroisoindole,2 36.0 g. (0.38 mole) of phenol, 270 ml. of 48% hydrobromic acid, and 45 ml. of propionic acid. A few boiling chips are added, and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser in the top of which is placed a T-tube connected to a source of low-pressure nitrogen and to a mercury bubbler. The mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The deeply colored reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and washed with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The aqueous phase is then added dropwise over a 1-hour period to a vigorously stirred solution of 200 g. of sodium hydroxide in 600 ml. of water in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath. The solution is transferred to a 3-l. separatory funnel and extracted with five 300-ml. portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. The solvent is distilled, and the dark residual oil is transferred to a distillation flask and distilled through a low-holdup, semimicro column. After removal of 1 or 2 drops of forerun, colorless 1,3-dihydroisoindole is collected at 96–97° (10 mm.) or 55–56° (2 mm.), n25D 1.5686, d204 1.081. The yield is 9.9–11.2 g. (63–71%).
E. (2R,3S,4S)-1-(tert-Butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2,4-dimethyl-5-hexyn-3-ol . An oven-dried, 100-mL, one-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is purged with argon. The flask is charged with (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal (3.00 g, 9.19 mmol) and the (R)-methanesulfonate (1.50 g, 10.1 mmol). Tetrahydrofuran (THF, 29.4 mL) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA, 7.4 mL) are added via syringe. To the solution is added PdCl2(dppf) (335 mg, 0.46 mmol), immediately followed by indium(I) iodide (2.66 g, 11.0 mmol). The resultant dark suspension is stirred vigorously for 1 hr at which time the reaction is judged complete by TLC. The reaction mixture is quenched by the addition of H2O (30 mL), and ether (20 mL) is added. After being stirred for 2 min the layers are separated and the ether layer is washed with brine. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (3 × 25 mL) and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 . Filtration of the solution and concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure followed by purification of the crude product by flash chromatography on silica gel provide 2.64 g (76%) of (2R,3S,4S)-1-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2,4-dimethyl-5-hexyn-3-ol as a clear oil and 201 mg of the (2R,3R,4R) diastereomer.
B. 7-Chloro-4-hydroxy-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with an air condenser 1 l. of Dowtherm A is heated to vigorous boiling, and the product of the above step is poured in through the condenser. Heating is continued for 1 hour, during which time a large proportion of the cyclization product crystallizes. The mixture is cooled, filtered, and washed with two 400-ml. portions of Skellysolve B (b.p. 61–70°) to remove the major portion of colored impurities. The air-dried filter cake is mixed with 1 l. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the mixture is refluxed vigorously until all the solid ester dissolves (about 1 hour). The saponification mixture is cooled, and the aqueous solution is separated from any oil that may be present. The solution is acidified to Congo red paper with concentrated hydrochloric acid (ca. 270 ml. of the 38% acid, sp. gr. 1.19) or 10% sulfuric acid. The 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid, weight 190–220 g. (85–98%), is collected by filtration and washed thoroughly with water. The dry acid melts at about 266° with effervescence.
B. 4-Acetoxy-3-nitrohexane (2).3 To the above flask, containing 3-nitro-4-hexanol (330 g, 2.24 mol), is added a magnetic stirring egg and 1 mL of concd sulfuric acid. The contents of the flask are stirred in an ice bath and acetic anhydride (240 g, 2.35 mol) is added in portions, keeping the temperature of the reactants below 60°C. After the addition of the acetic anhydride is complete, the contents of the flask are stirred for 1 hr. The flask is then equipped for vacuum distillation. The lower boiling components (Ac2O and AcOH) are removed at 25 mm by gently heating the stirred contents of the flask (≤ 100°C bath temperature). After these reagents have been removed, the system is cooled, attached to a vacuum pump, and carefully heated. The fraction boiling at 105–107°C/10 mm is collected, affording 4-acetoxy-3-nitrohexane (379 g, 2.0 mol, 90%).
Five hundred grams (2.34 moles) of phenyl salicylate is heated in a 1-l. special distilling flask having a wide side arm 20–25 cm. long, and fitted with two thermometers, one extending to the bottom of the flask, and the other just below the side arm. When the temperature of the liquid reaches 275–285°, phenol begins to distil. The heating is so regulated that the temperature of the vapor never exceeds 175° and preferably remains below 170°. In this way the phenol distils at the rate of 5–10 drops per minute. The temperature of the liquid rises gradually, and after six to seven hours reaches 350–355°. At this point the distillation of the phenol practically ceases; the weight of the distillate is 220–225 g.
The system is evacuated to a pressure of 5–10 mm., and the tube is heated to 700°, measured at the center of the heated zone. 2-Chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate is admitted at the rate of 10–20 g. per hour. From 70 g. (0.35 mole) of the cyclobutyl acetate there is obtained 62–68 g. of mixed solid and liquid condensate. Fractionation through a 30-cm. column packed with glass helices affords 30–35 g. (60–70%) of 1-chloro-1,4,4-trifluorobutadiene, b.p. 50–51°, nD25 1.3870; 18–22 g. of acetic acid; and 7–18 g. of recovered 2-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate.
B. 1,4-Bis(trimethylsilyl)buta-1,3-diyne (BTMSBD). A 1-L, four-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dry-ice cold-finger condenser, sintered gas inlet, and a swan-neck adapter that supports a thermometer and a rubber septum is charged with acetone (300 mL) and trimethylsilylacetylene (50 g, 0.51 mmol). The reaction mixture is agitated and a rapid stream of oxygen is passed through the solution. The supernatant solution containing the CuCl–TMEDA catalyst is transferred by syringe in 5-mL portions into the reaction vessel. The temperature rises as the catalyst is added and should have reached 35°C after about 75% of the catalyst has been added. When this temperature is reached, external ice cooling is applied to moderate the exothermic reaction. The remaining catalyst is added and the temperature is maintained in the range of 25–30°C for 2.5 hr. When the reaction is complete, there should be no evidence of trimethylsilylacetylene condensing on the cold trap. Agitation and oxygenation are then stopped.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, an argon inlet, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 10.8 g. (0.0500 mole) of di-tert-butyl malonate, 9.9 g. (0.0502 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl azide, 0.5 g. (0.001 mole) of methyltri-n-octylammonium chloride, and 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred vigorously as the flask is flushed with argon for 10 minutes, then 10 ml. (0.1 mole) of aqueous 10 N sodium hydroxide is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours, during which time it changes from colorless to pale yellow. A 200-ml. portion of water is added; the organic layer is separated, washed with three 500-ml. portions of water, and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration of the drying agent, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator using a water bath kept at 30°. The residual yellow-orange liquid is distilled at high vacuum. The temperature of the heating bath is gradually raised to ca. 70° and kept at 70–75° during the distillation. After separation of a small forerun, 7.2–7.6 g. (59–63%) of di-tert-butyl diazomalonate is collected, b.p. 44–45° (0.02 mm.), nD22 = 1.4568 and.
The filtrate (6.9–7 l.) is measured into a 16-l. (4-gal.) stone jar, and for every liter there is added 163 cc. of dilute sulfuric acid (one volume of 95 per cent sulfuric acid and one volume of water, cooled to room temperature). The first part of the acid must be added cautiously on account of the liberation of carbon dioxide.
A smooth, uniform paste is made by thoroughly mixing 60 g. (0.45 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate (p. 235) and 114 g. (0.45 mole) of hydroxyhydroquinone triacetate (p. 317). This requires several minutes of stirring. To this mixture is added 450 cc. of 75 per cent sulfuric acid. The paste slowly dissolves with the evolution of heat, giving a deep red solution; the latter is heated on a warm bath with occasional stirring until it reaches 80°, at which temperature it is maintained for one-half hour. It is then allowed to cool to room temperature and poured into 1850 cc. of cold water. The resulting mixture is cooled to room temperature, filtered with suction, and the precipitate washed with cold water to free it from excess acid. The 4-methylesculetin thus obtained is dried at 100° and is generally gray in color. The yield is about 80 g. (92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a rubber stopper holding a reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer, is clamped over a steam or water bath. In the flask is placed 2.5 l. of absolute alcohol and then there is added gradually, through the condenser, 115 g. (5 atoms) of clean sodium cut into pieces of suitable size. If the action becomes too violent, the mixture may be cooled by water poured over the outside of the flask. The sodium ethoxide solution is stirred, and cooled to about 50°, after which 825 g. (780 cc., 5.15 moles) of diethyl malonate is added slowly through the separatory funnel. To the clear solution is added gradually 685 g. (535 cc., 5.0 moles) of n-butyl bromide. The reaction commences almost immediately and considerable heat is generated. If the addition is too rapid, the reaction may become violent enough to require cooling of the flask by pouring water over it. Up to this point, the time required is about two hours.
The dark brown product is filtered and, after drying in the air, is extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus. The ether is removed by evaporation, and the light-colored residue (170 g.) is recrystallized from 1.65 l. of hot methanol. The crystals are washed on a Büchner funnel with methanol until free from colored impurities. The yield is 77–87 g. of material which melts at 187–190°. A second recrystallization from methanol (1.25 ml. per g. of product) gives pure βoctaacetylgentiobiose, with about 10% loss. The pure substance melts at 196° (cor.).
B. Benzofurazan oxide. A mixture of 21 g. (0.32 mole) of potassium hydroxide and 250 ml. of 95% ethanol in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask is heated on a steam bath until the solid dissolves. o-Nitroaniline (40 g., 0.29 mole) is dissolved in the warm alkali solution. The resulting deep red solution is then cooled to 0°, and the sodium hypochlorite solution from part A is added slowly with good stirring over the course of 10 minutes. The flocculent yellow precipitate is collected on a large Büchner funnel, washed with 200 ml. of water, and air-dried. The crude product weighs 36.0–36.5 g. and melts at 66–71°. The product is purified by recrystallization from a solution made up from 45 ml. of 95% ethanol and 15 ml. of water. Material insoluble in the hot solvent is removed by filtration, and the hot filtrate is allowed to cool to room temperature. The yield of yellow benzofurazan oxide is 31.6–32.5 g. (80–82%), m.p. 72–73°.
The total yield of crude centrifuged methylamine hydrochloride is 830–850 g. This product contains, as impurities, water, ammonium chloride, and some dimethylamine hydrochloride. In order to obtain a pure product, the crude methylamine hydrochloride is recrystallized from absolute alcohol. The crude salt is placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser protected at the top with a calcium chloride tube; 2 l. of absolute alcohol is added and the mixture heated to boiling. After about one-half hour the undissolved material is allowed to settle and the clear solution is poured off. When the alcoholic solution is cooled, methylamine hydrochloride crystallizes out. It is filtered off and centrifuged, and the alcohol used for another extraction. The process is repeated until the alcohol dissolves no more of the product (about five extractions are necessary). In the flask 100–150 g. of ammonium chloride remains, making the total recovery of ammonium chloride 850–950 g. The yield of recrystallized methylamine hydrochloride is 600–750 g. (45–51 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the ammonium chloride used up in the process) and.
The liquid is transferred to a continuous extractor and extracted with ether until the supernatant layer of ether remains colorless (about 2 hours). The ethereal extract is discarded. The aqueous solution is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and acidified by the cautious addition of 60 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The solution is returned to the extractor, which is attached to a tared round-bottomed flask. The solution is extracted with ether until no more p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid is obtained. The undried ether solution is evaporated to dryness on a boiling water bath to give crude p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid as a pale-yellow crystalline mass. The mass is broken up with a spatula, and the flask is kept over potassium hydroxide in a vacuum desiccator until its weight is constant. The yield of crude acid is 6.9–7.2 g. (92–96%). It melts at 210–215° (dec.).
The viscous, residual liquid is dissolved in 25 ml. of absolute ethanol and a stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 15 minutes, removing dissolved oxygen. A solution of sodium ethoxide is then prepared by cautiously dissolving freshly cut sodium (11.5 g., 0.500 mole) in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol, under a nitrogen atmosphere, in a 500-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser topped with a gas-inlet, a magnetic stirrer, and a rubber serum cap on one of the sidearms. When ethoxide formation is complete, the deoxygenated solution of the hydrogenated isoxazole is injected into the stirred reaction mixture through the rubber serum cap with a syringe. The solution is refluxed until the UV spectrum of a small aliquot withdrawn with a syringe through the serum cap shows the absence of absorption at 345 nm.. This requires about 30 hours.
(A) Methyl Homoveratrate.—In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1 l. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 200 g. (0.65 mole) of the azlactone of α-benzoylamino-β-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl) acrylic acid (m.p. 149–150°) (p. 55). The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and immersed in an oil bath so that the inner level is lower than the oil level of the bath. The mixture is refluxed gently for six to seven hours, until the evolution of ammonia is complete. The resulting solution contains the sodium salts of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylpyruvic acid and benzoic acid.
B. 2,5-Dinitrobenzoic acid. A suspension of 20 g. (0.12 mole) of the air-dried 2-nitroso-5-nitrotoluene in 100 ml. of water is prepared in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and to it is added 50 g. (0.17 mole) of powdered potassium dichromate. The flask is placed in an ice-salt bath, and the mixture is stirred vigorously by means of an efficient stirrer. When the temperature has dropped to 5°, 175 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added in a thin stream while the temperature is not allowed to exceed 35°. After all the sulfuric acid has been added the mixture is stirred and heated to 50°. The source of heat is removed, and the temperature is maintained between 50° and 55° by cooling in an ice bath as the exothermic reaction takes place. After 20 minutes the temperature is raised to 65° ± 3° and held there for 1 hour longer.
In a large round-bottomed flask are placed 1.4 kg. of dried blood corpuscle paste and 4.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The flask is warmed on a steam bath until the protein has dissolved, and the mixture is boiled gently under reflux for eighteen to twenty hours. After the hydrolysate has been concentrated under reduced pressure to a thick paste, the distillation is continued with the slow addition of a liter of water, thus eliminating most of the excess hydrochloric acid. The residue is taken up in 8 l. of warm water, cooled, and neutralized to pH 4.4–4.6 (methyl orange or bromcresol green) by the addition of concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. After the mixture has stood overnight, the precipitated pigment is removed by filtering through a large Büchner funnel fitted with two layers of filter paper and a 2-mm. layer of infusorial earth. The filtrate, which is dull red in color, is decolorized by warming and stirring for ten minutes with 60 g. of Norite.
A. 5-Hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone. A solution consisting of freshly distilled furfural (85.84 g, 0.893 mol) and rose bengal (1.82 g, 1.8 mmol, 0.2% mol/eq) in dry methanol (450 mL) is placed in a 600-mL Pyrex photochemical reactor. The outer vessel, which is fitted at its base with a fritted disc, is also equipped with a thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and reflux condenser. With oxygen bubbling from the bottom of the reactor and appropriate (water) cooling in the reactor well, the stirred solution is irradiated with a tungsten halogen lamp. The reaction temperature is maintained at or below 33°C at all times. After 18-22 hr, when no residual furfural can be detected by thin layer chromatography (TLC), the solution is carefully concentrated at 35-38°C (bath temperature). Following standing overnight, the orange solid that forms is taken up in 70 mL of cold (−78°C) chloroform and the resulting crystals are collected by vacuum filtration, washed once with 70 mL of chloroform, and dried under high vacuum to afford 72.70-75.65 g (81-85%) of 5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone as sticky, yellowish crystals, mp 52°C.
After the absorption of phosgene is completed the connection to the phosgene tank is replaced by a separatory funnel. The reaction flask is gently shaken while 108 g. (104 ml., 1 mole) of redistilled benzyl alcohol is added rapidly through the separatory funnel. The flask is allowed to stand in the ice bath for 30 minutes and at room temperature for 2 hours. The solution is then concentrated under reduced pressure, at a temperature not exceeding 60°, in order to remove hydrogen chloride, excess phosgene, and the major portion of the toluene. The residue weighs 200–220 g. and contains 155–160 g. of benzyl chloroformate (91–94% based on the benzyl alcohol). The amount of benzyl chloroformate present in this solution may be estimated by preparing the amide from a small aliquot portion, or it may be safely calculated by assuming a minimum yield of 90% based on the benzyl alcohol used.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed, in the order mentioned, 50 g. (1 mole) of 98% sodium cyanide in 100 ml. of water, 58.9 g. (1.1 moles) of ammonium chloride in 140 ml. of lukewarm water (about 35°), and 134 ml. (2 moles) of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90). The mixture is shaken while 120 g. (1 mole) of acetophenone in 300 ml. of 95% ethanol is added. The flask is stoppered with a rubber stopper, which is wired in place, and is then immersed in a water bath maintained at 60°. The flask is shaken from time to time, and a homogeneous solution results within 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is heated for 5 hours at 60°, then well cooled in an ice-water mixture, and poured, with precautions (under a well-ventilated hood), into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask which is immersed up to the neck in an ice-water mixture and which contains 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18–1.19). The reaction flask is rinsed with two 25-ml. portions of water, which are added to the hydrochloric acid solution. The solution of the aminonitrile is saturated at 0–5° with dry hydrogen chloride and is then set aside overnight in the ice-water bath, which is allowed to melt and come to the temperature of the room. The mixture of solid and liquid material is diluted with 1 l. of water and boiled vigorously for 2.5 hours under a reflux condenser in a well-ventilated hood. The dark hydrolysate is concentrated under reduced pressure to remove the acetophenone and other volatile impurities. The solution is finally transferred to a 10-in. evaporating dish and is stirred occasionally while it is evaporated almost to dryness. Once a heavy deposit of inorganic salts has formed, very little bumping occurs. The solid residue is evaporated on a water bath twice with 100-ml. portions of water in order to remove as much hydrochloric acid as possible. The residue is crushed, and 600 ml. of absolute ethanol is added. The suspension is warmed for a short time on a steam bath; it is shaken thoroughly and then chilled in an ice-water mixture. The inorganic salts are removed by filtration through a 15-cm. Büchner funnel, and the cake is washed with small portions of absolute ethanol until 600 ml. has been used. The combined filtrates and washings are placed in a 3-l. beaker, and pyridine is added while the mixture is stirred by hand with a thick glass rod. The addition of pyridine is continued until the solution is nearly neutral to Congo red paper, and then an additional 50 ml. is added; the total amount of pyridine required is 80–100 ml..
A mixture of 50 g. (0.257 mole) of dry hydroquinone diacetate (p. 452) and 116 g. (0.87 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is finely powdered in a mortar and introduced into a dry 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an air condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube and connected to a gas-absorption trap. The flask is placed in an oil bath which is heated slowly from room temperature so that at the end of about 30 minutes the temperature of the oil reaches 110–120°, at which point the evolution of hydrogen chloride begins. The temperature is then raised slowly to 160–165° and maintained at that point for about 3 hours; at the end of about 2 hours the evolution of hydrogen chloride becomes very slow and the mass assumes a green color and becomes pasty in consistency.
To 206 g. (2 moles) of ethyl N-methylcarbamate (p. 278) and 600 cc. of ordinary ethyl ether in a 5-l. flask is added, along with 200 g. of ice, 650 g. (9 moles) of 96 per cent sodium nitrite dissolved in 1 l. of cold water. The flask is provided with a stopper carrying a thermometer, a tube to lead off evolved nitric oxide, and a separatory funnel with an extension tube reaching to the bottom of the flask. A solution of 1.2 kg. (6.7 moles) of cold 35 per cent nitric acid, prepared by pouring 600 g. (426 cc.) of concentrated acid onto 600 g. of ice, is then cautiously added through the funnel in the course of one and one-half hours. The flask is given an occasional swirl to ensure some mixing, but most of the stirring is done by the evolved gases. Ice is added as required to keep the temperature below 15°. The ether layer first becomes pale red and gradually changes to a blue-green. As soon as the color has changed to green, the ether layer is separated, washed twice with cold water, and then with cold potassium carbonate solution until carbon dioxide is no longer evolved. The solution is dried with solid potassium carbonate, and the ether is distilled from a water bath using a 1-l. flask with a 30-cm. column arranged for vacuum distillation. The vacuum is applied as soon as most of the ether has been removed, and the flask is heated gently so that the temperature of the liquid does not exceed 45–50° until the pressure has been reduced below 20 mm. The yield of nitrosomethylurethane boiling at 59–61/10 mm. is 200 g. (76 per cent of the theoretical amount). The density is 1.133 at 20°.
B. Ethyl 3-benzyl-2-cyano-3-methylpentanoate. A 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a tantalum wire Hershberg stirrer, a condenser, and a separatory funnel, is arranged for use of a nitrogen atmosphere.2 Magnesium (19.2 g., 0.79 g. atom) and 100 ml. of dry ether3 are placed in the flask, and a solution of 100 g. (91 ml., 0.79 mole) of benzyl chloride in 500 ml. of dry ether is added in a period of 1.5–2.0 hours, with stirring, while the mixture boils spontaneously. The mixture is boiled for 15 minutes after completion of the addition, then a solution of 110 g. (0.66 mole) of ethyl sec-butylidenecyanoacetate in 130 ml. of benzene is added over a 30-minute period with spontaneous reflux. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for an additional hour. A precipitate separates after about 30 minutes.
A. 2-(1-Phenylcyclopentyl)-4,4,6-trimethyl-5,6-dihydro-1,3(4H)-oxazine. A 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 125-ml. pressure-equalizing funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet tube. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and 500 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran and 21.7 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-benzyl-4,4,6-trimethyl-5,6-dihydro-1,3(4H)-oxazine are added to the flask. The stirred solution is cooled to −78° with an acetone–dry ice bath, and 49 ml. (0.11 mole) of a 2.25 M solution of n-butyllithium in n-hexane is injected into the addition funnel. The n-butyllithium solution is added over a period of 15 minutes, and the funnel is rinsed by injecting 5 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran. The yellow to orange solution is allowed to stir at −78° for 30 minutes.
A. 2,2,7,7,12,12,17,17-Octamethyl-21,22,23,24-tetraoxaquaterene. A 1-liter, three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser is charged with 27.2 g. (0.400 mole) of freshly distilled furan, 24 ml. of absolute ethanol, 57.3 g. (0.200 mole) of the lithium perchlorate–1,2-dimethoxyethane complex, and 16 ml. of reagent grade concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting pale-yellow to pale-tan solution is stirred continuously and heated to 63° with an oil bath before 58.1 g. (0.80 mole) of acetone is added dropwise over 1 hour. During this addition the heat of reaction causes the solution to reflux, and some white solid begins to separate. After the addition is complete, stirring and heating are continued until refluxing ceases (about 30 minutes). The temperature of the bath is then raised to 78°, and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional 30 minutes. The reaction mixture, a dark red-brown solution containing a pasty white precipitate, is cooled to room temperature with continuous stirring, and 25 ml. of water and 300 ml. of diethyl ether are added. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hour, converting the precipitate into a finely divided white solid, and the mixture is filtered with suction, employing a medium-porosity, sintered-glass funnel. The residual crude product is washed thoroughly with portions of ether (total volume 100 ml.) followed by portions of 95% ethanol (total volume 50 ml.) and allowed to air-dry. The crude product (14.2–14.8 g.), m.p. 231–240°, is recrystallized from 140–150 ml. of reagent grade chloroform, yielding 7.3–7.4 g. of product as white needles, m.p. 241.5–243°. The mother liquors are concentrated to one-third their initial volume, separating 2.9–3.1 g. of a second crop of crystalline product, m.p. 240–242°, for a total yield of the tetraoxaquaterene of 10.2–10.5 g. (24–25%).
B. Methyl 3-methyl-2-furoate. The crude glycidic ester prepared as described above is placed in a 300-ml. flask which is attached to a 12-cm. column filled with 3/16-inch glass helices (or a 50-cm. simple Vigreux column) and heated in a liquid bath. When the pot temperature reaches about 160°, or before, methanol begins to distil. Heating is continued until the distillation of methanol essentially ceases and about the theoretical amount (64 g.) has been collected. After the heating bath has been allowed to cool, the product is distilled at reduced pressure; b.p. 72–78°/8 mm., yield 91–98 g. (65–70%). The ester solidifies in the receiver as an essentially pure compound, m.p. 34.5–36.5°.
E. 1,4,7,10,13,16-Hexakis(p-tolylsulfonyl)-1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaäzacycloöctadecane (5). A 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and an addition funnel is charged with 151 g. (0.248 mole) of sodium salt 2 and 2000 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide. The stirred solution is held at 100° as a solution of 200 g. (0.247 mole) of sulfonate 4 in 800 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide is added dropwise over 3 hours. After 30 minutes the heat source is removed, and 500 ml. of water is added through the addition funnel. After cooling to room temperature and stirring overnight, the cyclic hexamine 5 is collected by filtration, washed with 95% ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 100°, yielding 206–225 g. (70–77%), m.p. 260–290°.
Through the separatory funnel are introduced 1.6 l. of water, 500 cc. of c. p. acetone, and 372 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The stirrer is started and the temperature of the water bath is raised to 70–80°, so that the mixture in the flask is at about 65°. Then 354 cc. (7.3 moles) of bromine is carefully added through the separatory funnel. The addition, which requires one to two hours, is so regulated as to prevent the accumulation of unreacted bromine. As a rule the solution is decolorized in about twenty minutes after the bromine has been added. When the solution is decolorized, it is diluted with 800 cc. of cold water, cooled to 10°, made neutral to Congo red with about 1 kg. of solid anhydrous sodium carbonate, and the oil which separates is collected in a separatory funnel and dried with 80 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. After drying, the oil is fractionated and the fraction boiling at 38–48°/13 mm. is collected. The yield is 470–480 g. (50–51 per cent of the theoretical amount). It may be used without further purification for the preparation of acetol (p. 5); but, if a purer product is desired, the above product is refractionated and the fraction boiling at 40–42°/13 mm. is collected. The yield is 400–410 g. (43–44 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 2-(2,2-Dimethylpropoxy)-2,3-Dihydro-1H-Indene. A 250-mL, flame-dried three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a distillation head attached to a Liebig condenser, a nitrogen inlet and an internal thermometer is charged under nitrogen with 2,3-dihydro-2-tert-butyldimethysiloxy-1H-indene (10.6 g, 42.66 mmol) and 75 mL of dry acetonitrile. The flask is immersed in a preheated oil bath and the resulting solution is refluxed such that approximately 25 mL of the solvent is distilled off at atmospheric pressure. The solution is allowed to reach ambient temperature and the distillation head is replaced by a glass stopper. Bismuth tribromide (1.32 g, 2.94 mmol) is added in one portion and stirring is continued for 10 min. The glass stopper is then replaced by a rubber septum. Triethylsilane (8.2 mL, 51.34 mmol) is added via syringe over 5 min causing the immediate formation of a black suspension. The mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath to 0–5 °C before trimethylacetaldehyde (5.1 mL, 46.96 mmol) is added via syringe at such a rate as to maintain the internal temperature below 15 °C. The ice-water bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 30 min and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min.. The mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the black precipitate. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C/10 mmHg) to give a mixture of clear and orange oils. To this residue are added 100 mL of n-heptane and 40 g of silica gel. The mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C/10 mmHg) to afford a free-flowing powder that is placed at the top of a column (4.5 × 38 cm) of 100 g of silica gel. The column is eluted with n-heptane (1 L) followed by 2% ethyl acetate in n-heptane (about 1.2 L) to give 7.51 g (86 %) of 2,3-dihydro-2-(2',2'-dimethylethoxy)-1H-indene as a colorless oil.
The apparatus consists of a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 250-ml. dropping funnel, and a Friedrichs reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. Magnesium turnings (13.4 g., 0.55 g. atom) and 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether are put in the flask. Slow stirring is started, and 4 ml. of bromobenzene is added from the funnel. After reaction has started, the stirring rate is increased, and moderate reflux is maintained by addition of 80.5 g. of bromobenzene (making a total of 86 g. or 0.55 mole) in 100 ml. of ether. The solution is refluxed for 30–45 minutes after the addition and is cooled to room temperature. Stirring is continued while a solution of 51.5 g. (0.50 mole) of benzonitrile in 100 ml. of ether is added slowly enough to maintain only a gentle reflux. On completion of the addition, the reaction, mixture of pale-yellow liquid and white solid is refluxed with stirring for 4–6 hours. The stirred mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the Grignard-nitrile complex is decomposed by cautious addition of 120 ml. (3 moles) of anhydrous methanol.
In an open 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer and two dropping funnels, are placed 500 ml. of water, 250 ml. of technical naphtha boiling at 95–110°, and 195 g. (1.5 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate. The mixture is cooled to 5° with a water-ice bath, and 65 ml. of 33% sodium hydroxide solution (33 g. sodium hydroxide in 100 g. solution) is added. As the temperature is maintained below 10° and the pH near 11, the mixture is stirred vigorously, and there are added simultaneously from the two dropping funnels 230 g. (1.62 moles) of benzoyl chloride and 270 ml. of 33% sodium hydroxide solution. This addition should be made during about 2 hours. After addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is allowed to come to room temperature. In order to ensure complete reaction, the mixture is finally brought to 35° during about 1 hour. The stirrer is then stopped, and the aqueous layer is separated and placed in a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask.
The bright-yellow solution is re-cooled to 0 °C and 50 mL of a 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution is added by syringe over 5 min. The reaction mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 1 M aqueous hydrochloric acid solution (200 mL). The reaction flask is rinsed with diethyl ether (2 × 100 mL), which is added to the separatory funnel. After thorough mixing, the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under gradually reduced pressure (40 °C, 760 mmHg to 15 mmHg) using a rotary evaporator to leave 18.6 g of a pale-yellow residue.
The sand is washed with 3 × 25 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and then is layered with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture is cooled to −10°C under a nitrogen atmosphere. A solution of 25 mL (0.30 mol) of cyclopentadiene in 25 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise using a dropping funnel. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, by which time hydrogen evolution has ceased. In the absence of air, the solution ranges from near colorless to bright pink.
(B) Benzohydroxamic Acid.—A mixture of 35 g. (0.2 mole) of the potassium salt in 160 cc. of 1.25 N acetic acid is stirred and heated until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and finally chilled in an ice bath. Benzohydroxamic acid separates as white crystals. After filtering and drying, the product melts at 120–128° and weighs 25–26 g. (91–95 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude material may be purified by dissolving it in 4.5 times its weight of hot ethyl acetate, filtering from a small amount of solid, and allowing the solution to cool to room temperature. The white crystals which separate are filtered, washed with a little benzene, and allowed to dry in air. The yield of recrystallized product, m.p. 125–128°, from 26 g. of crude material is 20 g. (77 per cent recovery).
To break the emulsion 400 mL of ethanol is added and the mixture is transferred to separatory funnels and allowed to settle for 4 hr. Three layers form: at the top—a clear yellow ether phase, at the bottom—a brown aqueous phase and in between—an opaque emulsion layer. The brown aqueous layer is discarded. The emulsion layer (~1 L) is transferred to a flask and broken up by addition of 200 g of magnesium sulfate in portions. Heat is evolved, the ether boils and two layers form. This ether layer is combined with the first ether layer, dried over ~50 g of magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation to ~300 mL of an orange oil. Toluene (500 mL) is added and the solution cooled to 4°C overnight. Fine white crystals (70–71 g) are collected by filtration and washed twice with 20-mL portions of cold toluene. The filtrate is concentrated to ~600 mL by rotary evaporation and cooled once again to 4°C. The additional 10 g of crystals which form are collected by filtration and washed twice with 20-mL portions of toluene. Recrystallization of the combined crystals from 375–400 mL of toluene yields 65–68 g (64–67%) of white crystals, mp 211–213.5°C; [α]D19 −33.2 ± 0.8° (THF, c 0.2); >99% diol (see), >99.9% enantiomeric purity.
C. (5S,6R)-4-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenylmorpholin-2-one. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 33.2 g (0.083 mol) of crude ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl) glycinate, 1.90 g (0.010 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 670 mL of benzene. The reaction flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extractor, which is packed with 65 g of calcium chloride (CaCl2, anhydrous, 30 mesh) and a condenser with a drying tube. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 10 hr. After the first 4 hr, the CaCl2 in the Soxhlet extractor is replaced; the total amount of CaCl2 used in the reaction is 130 g. Ultimately, the reaction mixture becomes a suspension. Removal of benzene under reduced pressure yields white solids that are dissolved in 310 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The solution is washed with water and 5% aqueous NaHCO3 in a separatory funnel until the CH2Cl2 solution becomes clear. After removal of CH2Cl2 under vacuum, the resulting white crystals are dissolved by boiling in 600 mL of absolute EtOH; the resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The white crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold EtOH, and dried at 60°C. Concentration of the mother liquor by rotary evaporation affords a residue that can also be recrystallized in absolute EtOH to provide additional product. The above described procedure is performed in duplicate, providing (5S,6R)-4-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-5,6-diphenylmorpholin-2-one in yields of 21.7 g and 20.3 g (average yield for the two steps: 71%).
The following preparation, through the filtration of the crude solid and washing with water, should be carried out in a hood with a good draft.
B. 2-Chlorothiirane 1,1-dioxide. In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and two pressure-equalizing addition funnels is placed an ethereal solution of 4.6 g. (0.11 mole) of diazomethane. The system is blanked with nitrogen, the stirrer is started, and the solution is cooled to −10° with an ice-methanol bath. A solution of 14.9 g. (0.100 mole) of chloromethanesulfonyl chloride in 40 ml. of ether and a solution of 10.0 g. (0.099 mole) of triethylamine in 40 ml. of ether are simultaneously added dropwise from the two addition funnels. The addition requires about 45 minutes. The insoluble triethylamine hydrochloride is separated by filtration and washed with 25 ml. of cold ether. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated at reduced pressure below 25° to give white crystalline 2-chlorothiirane 1,1-dioxide, m.p. 49–51°; yield 10.0–10.5 g.. (80–84%). The product may be further purified by recrystallization from ether-hexane at −70°; m.p. 53–54° (8.9 g. after two recrystallizations) and.
B. t-Butyl carbazate. In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 388.4 g. (2.0 moles) of phenyl t-butyl carbonate and 120.2 g. (2.4 moles) of a 64% hydrazine solution. The mixture is swirled by hand and heated on a hot plate. When the internal temperature reaches 75–80°, it then rises rapidly and spontaneously to 104–110°, the two layers forming a clear solution. The solution is allowed to cool overnight. The mixture is then diluted with 500 ml. of ether and transferred to a separatory funnel in which it is shaken vigorously for about 10 minutes with a solution prepared from 160 g. (4.0 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 1.2 l. of water. The resulting two layers are placed in a 2-l. continuous extractor and extracted for 48 hours with ether. The ether solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation from a water bath. The last portions of ether are removed with the aid of a water aspirator. The residual oil is then distilled using a Claisen flask with an air bath maintained at 115–125°. After 1 or 2 drops of fore-run the carbazate is collected at 61–65° (1.2 mm.), n24D 1.4518. The yield is 235–256 g. (89–97%).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer are placed 468 g. (530 cc., 6 moles) of benzene and 92 g. (50 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and 164 g. (203 cc., 2 moles) of cyclohexene is added with stirring over a period of one and one-half hours, while the temperature is maintained between 5° and 10°. Stirring is continued for an additional hour after all the cyclohexene has been added.
The mixture of benzene and hexyl alcohol is now distilled in a current of steam; about 7 l. of distillate must be collected before all the product is distilled. The oily layer is separated and the watery portion distilled until free of hexyl alcohol. The oil so obtained is added to the main quantity and the watery portion again distilled. The united product is now stirred on the steam bath for one to two hours with 1 l. of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and again subjected to steam distillation, as before. The oily product so obtained is then distilled under atmospheric pressure with the use of a good fractionating column. The fraction boiling up to 85° is mostly benzene and water. The fraction boiling between 85° and 154° is collected separately for redistillation, and the fraction boiling at 154–157° collected as pure material. There is practically no high-boiling residue. The yield is 368–380 g. (60–62 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mixture is cooled and the anisole layer is separated. The aqueous portion is extracted with about 200 cc. of benzene. The combined anisole-benzene portion is washed once with water, dried over calcium chloride and distilled from a modified Claisen flask (p. 130). The portion boiling at 100–153° is refractionated. The main fraction distils at 153–154°/748 mm. The yield is 388–405 g. (72–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
A 50-mL, round-bottomed flask is charged with 65 g (0.50 mol) of 1-(methoxyvinyl)trimethylsilane and 300 mL of a 4:1 v/v mixture of acetone and 1.0 M aqueous hydrochloric acid. After the pale-yellow-green solution is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature, it is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and 150 mL each of water and diethyl ether are added. After separation, the aqueous layer is washed with diethyl ether (2 × 50 mL), and these extracts are combined with the organic material. The ethereal solution is washed with water (3 × 300 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and distilled to give 45–48 g (78–83%) of acetyltrimethylsilane (bp 112°C, 760 mm), nD20 1.4125 (lit.2 1.4113) and.
Two hundred and sixteen grams (2.07 moles) of nitroguanidine1 and 740 g. (11.3 moles) of purified zinc dust are thoroughly ground together in a mortar, and then enough water (about 400 ml.) is added with stirring with the pestle to form a thick paste. The paste is transferred to a 3-l. enameled can or beaker surrounded by an ice bath. A solution of 128 g. (2.14 moles) of glacial acetic acid in 130 ml. of water is cooled to 5° in another 3-l. beaker, which is fitted with a strong mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath. The paste of nitroguanidine and zinc dust, cooled to 5°, is added slowly with mechanical stirring, the temperature of the reaction mixture being kept between 5° and 15°. A total of about 1 kg. of cracked ice is added to the mixture from time to time as the mixture becomes too warm or too thick to stir. The addition of the paste takes about 8 hours, and the final volume of the mixture is about 1.5 l.. The mixture is then slowly warmed to 40° on a water bath with continued stirring, and this temperature is maintained for 1–5 minutes, until reduction is complete.
A filtered solution of the crude product in 200 cc. of hot absolute alcohol is treated with 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Most of the hydrochloride precipitates at once and is filtered, washed with alcohol, and dried. The filtrate is cooled in an ice-salt bath and again filtered, and the precipitate is washed, dried, and added to the previous portion. The yield is 46–48 g. of material melting at about 215°. The hydrochloride is dissolved in three times its weight of water, previously heated nearly to boiling. The solution is filtered if necessary and then treated with sodium hydroxide solution (2.2 g. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution for each gram of hydrochloride used). The free base separates at once, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath and filtered. This product melts at 120–123°. The yield of pure base is 28–30 g. (37–40 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The crude aminonaphthol is washed into a beaker containing a solution at 30° of 2 g. of stannous chloride dihydrate and 53 cc. (0.63 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water. When the mixture is stirred the amine soon dissolves, leaving in suspension a small amount of fluffy material which is easily distinguishable from the original lumps. The solution is clarified by stirring (without heating) for five minutes with 10 g. of decolorizing carbon, and it is then filtered by suction. The pale yellow solution is treated with 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to the boiling point, a second 50 cc. of the acid being added as the heating progresses. The color becomes somewhat fainter during this process. The vessel containing the hot solution is transferred to an ice bath and allowed to cool undisturbed, and the 1-amino-2-naphthol hydrochloride soon separates in the form of large, perfectly colorless needles. When fairly cold, 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the solution is cooled to 0° before collecting the product. The hydrochloride is washed with a cold solution of 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 cc. of water and dried on a filter paper at a temperature not above 30–35°. The yield is 70–83 g. (72–85 per cent of the theoretical amount). The material will remain colorless, or very nearly so, if protected from the light in storage. The fresh solution in water is only faintly colored and leaves but a trace of residue on filtration.
The crude product, which is yellow in color, is dissolved in 40 cc. of hot water, decolorized with 1 g. of charcoal, and treated with 33 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After standing overnight in the refrigerator, the first crop, weighing about 23 g., is obtained. This melts with decomposition at 208–209° (corr.). On concentrating the mother liquors two further crops of equal purity can be obtained, giving a total yield of 26–27 g. of glutamic acid hydrochloride of satisfactory quality.
A. Chloromethyl methyl ether as a solution in toluene. A three-necked 500-mL flask is fitted with a magnetic stirbar, thermometer, reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and addition funnel. The vessel is charged with dimethoxymethane (22.1 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv), toluene (66 mL, 3 volumes) and ZnBr2 (5.6 mg, 0.01 mol%). The zinc bromide dissolves shortly after addition. Acetyl chloride (17.8 mL, 250 mmol, 1 equiv) is placed in the addition funnel and then introduced into the reaction mixture at a constant rate over 5–15 minutes. The addition funnel is rinsed with a minimum volume of toluene (5 mL) directly into the reaction mixture. The reaction self-heats slowly to 40–45 °C and then cools to ambient temperature over 2–3 h, at which time the exchange reaction is typically complete. This clear, colorless solution of chloromethyl methyl ether in toluene is employed directly in the subsequent step without further manipulation.
The benzene solution is placed in a 5-l. flask, and 3–3.5 l. of benzene is removed by distillation. The residual liquid is set aside and allowed to cool. The dibenzoylbutane which crystallizes after several hours is filtered; it melts at 104–107°. An equal volume of ether is added to the light brown filtrate, and a second crop of crystals is obtained.
A. 2-(Trichloromethyl)bicyclo[3.3.0]octane. To a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer are added 325 g. (3.0 moles) of cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene, 3 l. of chloroform, and 14.6 g. (0.06 mole) of benzoyl peroxide. The resulting solution is stirred and refluxed (63–65°) on the steam bath for a total of 5 days. Four 7.3 g.-(0.03 mole-)portions of benzoyl peroxide are added, one on each consecutive day of reaction. After a total of 5 days at reflux, the reaction mixture is cooled and washed with three 250-ml. portions of aqueous sodium bicarbonate and with 250 ml. of water, all the washes being discarded. The chloroform solution is dried with 30 g. of magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is distilled at atmospheric pressure using a short (8-in.) Vigreux column to collect 2760–2790 ml. of chloroform, b.p. 55–64°, which is discarded. The pressure is reduced and distillation continued to obtain two fractions: (1) b.p. 31° (47 mm.) to 65° (0.2 mm.), 300 g.; (2) b.p. 65–153° (0.2 mm.), 169 g.. Fraction 2 is refractionated with the same Vigreux column to obtain 106–117 g. (approximately 35% based on unrecovered cis,cis-1,5-cyclooctadiene) of 2-(trichloromethyl)bicyclo[3.3.0]octane, b.p. 116–125° (5 mm.), n25D 1.5110–1.5115. The product is pure (by gas chromatography) and may be used in the next step.
After this interval, a solution of benzophenone (25.5 g, 140 mmol) in anhydrous ether (200 mL) is added dropwise over a period of 1.25 hr. The dark green to greenish-yellow suspension is maintained at −70°C for 2.0 hr, and the reaction is then quenched by dropwise addition of glacial acetic acid (8.5 mL, 150 mmol) over a period of 15 min. The resulting lemon-yellow suspension is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of 12 hr, during which time the mixture becomes cream colored.
1,5-Dichloro-2,4-pentanedione . A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is charged with bis(1,5-dichloro-2,4-pentanedione)copper(II) complex (22.0 g, 55.1 mmol) followed by diethyl ether (200 mL) and 10% sulfuric acid (200 mL). The reaction is stirred vigorously until all the solid dissolves (ca. 45 min). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (2 × 200 mL). The combined ether layers are washed with brine (2 × 300 mL) and dried (Na2SO4 ). The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether phase is concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude material (ca. 20 g) is hydrogenated without further purification.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stirrer, are placed 231 g. (0.5 mole) of the addition compound of β-naphthalenediazonium chloride and mercuric chloride (p. 432), 700 cc. of acetone (b.p. 55–57°) and 189 g. (3 moles) of copper powder. The mixture is quickly cooled to 20° and stirred for one hour. Seven hundred cubic centimeters of concentrated aqueous ammonia solution (sp. gr. 0.9) is added, mixed well, and allowed to stand overnight. The supernatant liquid is decanted; the solid is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed successively with 25-cc. portions of water, acetone, and ether. After air-drying, the crude material is recrystallized from xylene, using decolorizing carbon. The crystals thus obtained are slightly yellow and melt at 241.5–243.5°. The yield is 51–55 g. (45–48 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the addition compound used).
(B) Nitrosomethylurea.—A mixture of 49 g. (0.42 mole) of acetyl methylurea and 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is heated, with hand stirring, on a steam bath until it is apparent that no more solid is dissolving. Heating is continued for three or four minutes longer (total time on steam bath—eight to twelve minutes), after which the solution is diluted with an equal volume of water and cooled below 10° in an ice bath. A cold saturated solution of 38 g. (0.55 mole) of sodium nitrite in 55 cc. of water is then run in slowly with stirring. The mixture is allowed to remain in the ice bath for several minutes, after which the nitrosomethylurea is filtered and washed with about 8–10 cc. of ice-cold water. Air drying gives 33–36 g. (76–82 per cent of the theoretical amount) of nitrosomethylurea as pale yellow crystals melting at 123–124°.
B. 5-(3,4-Dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2,5-trimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (2). An oven-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an oval magnetic stir bar, a 50-mL addition funnel, a two-tap Schlenk adaptor connected to a bubbler and an nitrogen/vacuum manifold and a rubber septum is charged with 1 (21.9 g, 74.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and potassium carbonate (15.4 g, 112 mmol, 1.5 equiv) by temporary removal of the septum. Freshly distilled N,N-dimethylformamide (74 mL) is added into the reaction flask. After complete dissolution of the reactants, iodomethane (9.3 mL, 149 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added via syringe to the addition funnel, and added dropwise to the reaction mixture.
A. Preparation of Cyclopropane-1,1-dicarboxylic acid (1). To a 1-L solution of aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide, mechanically stirred in a 2-L, three-necked flask, is added, at 25°C, 114.0 g (0.5 mol) of triethylbenzylammonium chloride. To this vigorously stirred suspension was added a mixture of 80.0 g (0.5 mol) of diethyl malonate and 141.0 g (0.75 mol) of 1,2-dibromoethane all at once. The reaction mixture is vigorously stirred for 2 hr. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask by rinsing the flask with three 75-mL portions of water. The mixture is magnetically stirred and cooled with an ice bath to 15°C, and then carefully acidified by dropwise addition of 1 L of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The temperature of the flask is maintained between 15 and 25°C during acidification. The aqueous layer is poured into a 4-L separatory funnel and extracted three times with 900 mL of ether. The aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted three times with 500 mL of ether. The ether layers are combined, washed with 1 L of brine, dried (MgSO4), and decolorized with activated carbon. Removal of the solvent by rotary evaporation gave 55.2 g of a semisolid residue. The residue was triturated with 100 mL of benzene. Filtration of this mixture gave 43.1–47.9 g (66–73%) of 1 as white crystals, mp 137–140°C.
About two-thirds of the carbon tetrachloride is distilled. The solution is cooled, and the crystals of p-nitrophenyl isocyanate are filtered as quickly as possible in order to avoid prolonged exposure of the compound to the moisture of the air. By concentration of the mother liquor a further crop is obtained. The product is recrystallized from dry carbon tetrachloride and is obtained in the form of light yellow needles melting at 56–57°. The yield after one recrystallization is 152–170 g. (85–95 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. o'-(1,1-Difluorohex-1-en-2-yl)-p-toluenesulfonanilide. A 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask containing o-(1,1-difluorohex-1-en-2-yl)aniline (4.94 g, 23.4 mmol) is equipped with a glass stopper, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar, and a stopcock inlet connected to the argon line. Pyridine (50 mL) is introduced and the solution is cooled to 0 °C. p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride (TsCl, 6.69 g, 35.1 mmol) is added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 h. Water (5 mL) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.5 h. Water (50 mL) and ether (100 mL) are added to the mixture before 2 M aqueous HCl solution (400 mL) is introduced. Organic materials are extracted with ether (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed successively with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL), and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g). After filtration through filter paper and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, a brown liquid (8.77 g) is obtained. This is used in the next step without further purification.
A mixture of 100 g. (0.55 mole) of benzophenone (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 95), 60 g. (0.86 mole) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 318), 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and 40 cc. of water is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask. To this is added in portions, with shaking, 110 g. (2.75 moles) of powdered sodium hydroxide. If the reaction becomes too vigorous, cooling with tap water may be necessary. After all the sodium hydroxide has been added, the flask is connected to a reflux condenser, heated to boiling, and refluxed for five minutes. After cooling, the contents are poured into a solution of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 2 l. of water. The precipitate is filtered with suction, thoroughly washed with water, and dried. The yield is 106–107 g. (98–99 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 141–142°. On crystallizing 20 g. from 80 cc. of methyl alcohol, 13 g. of crystalline material of the same melting point is obtained.
The watery mother liquors from the crude methyl red are rendered alkaline with sodium hydroxide and distilled until no more dimethylaniline passes over. In this way 250 to 400 g. of moist dimethylaniline is recovered.
Sodium arsonoacetate is prepared by adding the freshly filtered and washed barium arsonoacetate as obtained above (without drying) to a solution of 108 g. (0.76 mole) of anhydrous sodium sulfate in 500 cc. of hot water. The mixture is mechanically stirred for one hour, the barium sulfate filtered off, and the filtrate concentrated on the steam bath until crystallization commences. Upon cooling and stirring, sodium arsonoacetate separates and is filtered by suction, the filtrate being concentrated to obtain a second crop of crystals. The yield of the combined fractions is 100–110 g. (80–88 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure affords 1.9–2.1 g. of the crude yellow adduct. This crude material is dissolved in 8 ml. of hot dibutyl ether (70–80°) and rapidly percolated through approximately 2.0 g. of Florisil. Cooling and filtering the eluent affords 1.2–1.3 g. (40–44%) of yellow crystals, m.p. 77–80°. An additional recrystallization from dibutyl ether or ethyl acetate–hexane yields pale yellow crystals, m.p. 78.5–80°.
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 34 g. (0.347 mole) of maleic anhydride and 175 g. (200 ml., 2.24 moles) of dry, thiophene-free benzene. Stirring is started, and, when the maleic anhydride has dissolved, 100 g. (0.75 mole) of anhydrous reagent grade aluminum chloride powder is added in 6–8 portions through the third neck of the flask at a rate so that the benzene refluxes moderately. The addition requires about 20 minutes. The mixture is then heated under reflux on a steam bath and stirred for 1 hour. The reaction flask is cooled thoroughly in an ice bath, a 250-ml. dropping funnel is attached to the third neck, and the mixture is hydrolyzed by adding 200 ml. of water with stirring and cooling (the first 50 ml. during 15–20 minutes and the balance in about 10 minutes), followed by 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Stirring is continued for an additional 40 minutes, during which time it may be necessary to use a spatula to scrape adhering particles of the red-brown aluminum chloride addition compound from the walls of the flask.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 35-cm. reflux condenser are placed 250 g. (0.74 mole) of N-grade wood rosin, 740 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 42 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). A stream of carbon dioxide is passed over the surface of the solution by means of a glass tube which extends downward through the condenser during this reaction. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 hours. At the end of this time, the ethanol and acid are removed by steam distillation and the water is decanted. The residue is cooled to room temperature and dissolved in 1 l. of ether. The ether solution is extracted with water and dried over 200 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The bulk of the ether is evaporated on the steam bath, and the last traces are removed by fusing the rosin over a free flame and under a vacuum furnished by a water aspirator. The molten rosin, blanketed continuously with carbon dioxide, is most conveniently handled by being poured into a paper boat; yield 245 g.; [α]D24 −35°.
A. Potassium thiotosylate. A solution of 64.9 g. (1.00 mole) of 86.5% potassium hydroxide in 28 ml. of water is cooled in an ice bath, saturated with hydrogen sulfide, and flushed with nitrogen to ensure complete removal of excess hydrogen sulfide and. The freshly prepared potassium hydrosulfide solution is diluted with 117 ml. of water and stirred under nitrogen at 55–60° before 95.3 g. (0.500 mole) of finely ground p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is introduced in small portions at a uniform rate so that the reaction temperature is maintained at 55–60°. A mildly exothermic reaction ensues, and the solution becomes intensely yellow. After about 90 g. of the tosyl chloride has been introduced, the yellow color disappears, and the dissolution of the chloride ceases. The reaction mixture is rapidly filtered with suction through a warmed funnel, and the filtrate is cooled several hours at 0–5°. The crystals of potassium thiotosylate are filtered, dissolved in 200 ml. of hot 80% ethanol, filtered hot to remove traces of sulfur, and cooled several hours at 0–5°. The recrystallized salt is filtered and air-dried, providing 48–55 g. (42–49%) of white crystals.
A. N-Nitroso-β-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone. In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, is placed 250 ml. (2.1 moles) of 30% aqueous methylamine. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the solution has dropped to 5°, 196 g. (2 moles) of mesityl oxide is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains below 20° and. After the mesityl oxide has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand without cooling for 30 minutes.
C. n-Pentadecanal. The crude acetal from Part B is dissolved in 600 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, and 150 ml. of water containing 2 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is added. The resulting pale mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hour and cooled. The hydrolysate is poured into 600 ml. of water and extracted with three 300-ml. portions of pentane. The colorless pentane extracts are combined, washed three times with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and once with water, and dried over sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent furnishes an oil which upon distillation under reduced pressure yields 18.7–22.5 g. of n-pentadecanal, b.p. 103–106° (0.2 mm.). The overall yield from 1-bromotetradecane is 47–55%. The product solidifies eventually and should be kept under an inert atmosphere in the refrigerator.
One kilogram (805 cc., 9.8 moles) of 90 per cent glycerol (sp. gr., 1.243) and 20 g. of acetic acid are placed in a weighed 2-l. flask which is immersed in an oil bath heated to 100–110°. The flask is fitted with a two-holed stopper, which carries a long tube reaching to the bottom of the flask and a short exit tube. The long tube is connected to a hydrogen chloride generator; the short one, to a catch-bottle and some system for absorbing any excess of hydrogen chloride (see Fig. 7 on p. 97). A stream of dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. The absorption of gas is very rapid at the start but gradually falls off towards the end of the reaction; the stream of hydrogen chloride should be regulated accordingly. The flask is removed from time to time and weighed; when the absorption of gas practically ceases, the increase in weight will be about 875 g. (25 per cent more than the theoretical amount).
A. Coumarin dibromide. In a 1-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a condenser fitted with a trap for hydrogen bromide, are placed 146 g. (1 mole) of coumarin and 200 ml. of chloroform. A solution of 160 g. (1 mole) of bromine in 85 ml. of chloroform is added dropwise to the well-stirred solution of coumarin at room temperature over a period of 3 hours. Excess bromine is removed by adding approximately 200 ml. of a 20% solution of sodium sulfite through the dropping funnel. The colorless chloroform layer is separated, washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, and dried over magnesium sulfate. After the mixture has stood for only a few minutes, the magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and the solution of the dibromide is evaporated to 100 ml. in a rapid stream of dry air. The coumarin dibromide is collected on a filter, and the mother liquor is evaporated nearly to dryness by an air blast. This mixture is filtered, and the slightly yellow mother liquor is evaporated to dryness. The product of the third evaporation is slightly discolored, and it is washed with two 15-ml. portions of ether. The combined precipitates weigh 215 g. (70%) and melt at 102–105°.
A. Purification of technical phenanthrene. One and one-half kilograms of technical 90% phenanthrene is dissolved in 9 l. of ethanol in a 12-l. flask on a steam bath, and the hot solution is decanted from any insoluble material. The product crystallizes upon cooling of the solution. One kilogram of the crystallized product is dissolved in 2.2 l. of hot glacial acetic acid in a 5-l. three-necked flask provided with an efficient reflux condenser and a dropping funnel. To the boiling solution is gradually added 72 ml. of an aqueous solution containing 60 g. of chromic anhydride, and then 30 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly from the dropping funnel. The solution is refluxed for 15 minutes. The hot solution is then poured with vigorous stirring into 4.5 l. of water in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask. After cooling, the mixture is filtered, and the product is washed with water and air-dried. The product is distilled at 148–149°/1 mm. The distillate is recrystallized from ethanol to give 800–900 g. of nearly white phenanthrene, m.p. 98.7–99°.
B. Preparation of di-μ-chlorobis[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclo-butadiene)cobalt]dipalladium ([COP-Cl]2). A single-necked, 250-mL round-bottomed flask is fitted with a stirring bar. The flask is charged with di-μ-acetatobis[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt]dipalladium (8.9 g, 5.9 mmol) and 59 mL of acetone. Aqueous sodium chloride (2 M, 30 mL) is then added, and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred at room temperature. After 4 h, the yellow solid is collected by filtration of the reaction mixture. This solid is washed with 125 mL of water followed by 20 mL of acetone and then dried under vacuum to provide 8.2 g (5.6 mmol, 95% yield) of di-μ-chlorobis[(η5-(S)-(pR)-2-(2'-(4'-methylethyl)oxazolinyl)cyclopentadienyl, 1-C, 3'-N)(η4-tetraphenyl-cyclobutadiene)cobalt]dipalladium, [COP-Cl]2, as a mustard-colored solid.
The lower, yellow layer of diketone in the distillate is separated; the water layer is then saturated with salt and extracted with ether, one 80-ml. and two 25-ml. portions being used for each liter of the aqueous solution. The ether extracts are combined with the diketone proper and dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed on the steam bath, and the residual material is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. Acetylbenzoyl is collected at 114–116°/20 mm.. The yield is 30–32 g. (66–70% of the theoretical amount).
The resulting milky suspension is distilled with steam until about 2 l. of distillate has collected. The distillate is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with three 100-cc. portions of benzene. The extract is dried thoroughly overnight with flaked potassium hydroxide and decanted from the spent drying agent. After removal of the solvent by distillation, the amine is distilled under reduced pressure. Practically all the material distils at 111–112°/20 mm., or 115.5–117°/26 mm. The pure amine forms a practically colorless, highly refringent liquid and weighs 51–53 g. (63–66 per cent of the theoretical amount). It develops color rapidly on standing.
A. 1,1-Bis(benzyloxy)propan-2-one (2). A one-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with pyruvic aldehyde dimethyl acetal (12.1 mL, 100 mmol) in cyclohexane (50 mL), benzyl alcohol (22.8 mL, 220 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (0.95 g, 5 mmol). The resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h using a Dean–Stark separator for the removal of methanol. When the reaction is complete (approximately 2 h), approximately 8.1 mL (200 mmol) of MeOH is obtained. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and washed with saturated potassium carbonate solution (25 mL) and water (20 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted twice with cyclohexane (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic phase is dried (Na2SO4), filtered, evaporated and the crude black oil is purified by column chromatography using a 10-cm diameter column packed with 900 g silica gel and eluting with 2.1 L of MTBE/cyclohexane (1:20) to afford keto acetal 2 as a yellowish oil (22.3 g, 83%).
After 556 g. (2 moles) of methyl isothiourea sulfate (p. 411) is placed in the three-necked flask, a very slow current of air is drawn through the apparatus by means of the suction pump while 800 cc. of cold 5 N sodium hydroxide is added to the methyl isothiourea sulfate through the dropping funnel. The mixture is warmed very slowly to generate the methyl mercaptan. As the reaction nears completion (after about two hours), the mixture is heated strongly for about thirty minutes.
A. sec-Butyl crotonate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 258 g. (3 moles) of crotonic acid, 370 g. (5 moles) of sec-butyl alcohol in which has been dissolved 6–7 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 300 ml. of benzene. A few boiling chips are added, and the flask is fitted with a suitable water separator in the top of which is placed a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated under reflux for about 12 hours or until no further separation of aqueous phase occurs. About 65 ml. of water is collected. The cooled reaction mixture is diluted with 200 ml. of ether, washed with 10% sodium carbonate solution until neutral to litmus, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, and finally dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is distilled, and the ester is fractionated under reduced pressure through a small column. The yield of sec-butyl crotonate, b.p. 74–75°/30 mm. or 83–84°/45 mm., n25D 1.4261, is 360–390 g. (85–90%).
B. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal.3 A 1000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a gas inlet, an acetone–dry ice condenser with a drying tube containing potassium hydroxide pellets, a stopper, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is placed in an acetone–dry ice bath and anhydrous ammonia is condensed into the flask (400 mL). A small piece of potassium metal (ca. 0.5 g) is added to the liquid ammonia and the cooling bath is removed. A catalytic amount of anhydrous ferric chloride (0.1 g) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to reflux temperature, at which time the deep blue color turns to gray. The remaining potassium metal (12.2 g, 0.31 g-atom total) is added in 0.5-g pieces over ca. 30 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to stir until a gray suspension results (20–30 min). A −50°C cooling bath is placed under the flask and the stopper is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalized dropping funnel containing 22.9 g (0.1 mol) of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane in 50 mL of anhydrous ether. This solution is added dropwise to the solution of freshly generated potassium amide over 15 min while the temperature is maintained at −50°C. After the solution is stirred for 3 hr at −50° to −60°C, solid ammonium chloride is added slowly to quench the excess potassium amide. The cooling bath is removed and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. During the course of the evaporation, anhydrous ether (350 mL total) is added dropwise through the addition funnel to replace the ammonia. After the temperature has reached 0°C, the brown reaction mixture is filtered by suction through a coarse fritted-glass filter to remove the inorganic salts and the salts are washed twice with 25 mL of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrate and washes are concentrated under reduced pressure (80–100 mm, 30°C) to constant weight (ca. 4–5 hr). The residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled, short-path distillation head, and the product is distilled (1.25 mm; 30–35°C) into an ice-cooled receiver. Cyclopropenone 1,3-propanediol ketal is obtained as a colorless liquid (6.1–7.8 g, 55–70% yield,).
A solution of 57 g. (0.88 mole) of potassium cyanide in 570 ml. of water is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a reflux condenser. Fifty-eight grams (0.15 mole) of N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene methiodide2 is added and the mixture is heated to boiling with good stirring. As the mixture is brought to boiling, the solid goes into solution. Within a few minutes of the onset of boiling, evolution of trimethylamine begins and a steam-volatile oil starts to separate from the solution. The reaction mixture is boiled vigorously with stirring for 2 hours and then is allowed to cool to room temperature. During the cooling the oil that has separated solidifies.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask with glass joints are placed 850 g. of commercial glacial acetic acid and 100 ml. of water. The flask is fitted with a stirrer. One of the side necks carries a reflux condenser and a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask; the other is provided with a stopper which can be replaced by a powder funnel. The flask is surrounded by a water bath. At room temperature 156 g. (1.53 moles) of 98–99% chromium trioxide is added, and the mixture is stirred for about 15 minutes to effect solution of the oxidizing agent.
Using 180 g. of pyridine in place of the 130 g. suggested, and a corresponding increase in the other chemicals except the sodium and alcohol, a yield of 300–326 g. of benzoyl piperidine is obtained. This is a smaller percentage yield (70–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) but the actual yield more than repays for the excess of pyridine used.
Recovery of (R,R)-(+)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyltartaric acid diamide. The aqueous layer from the above extraction is concentrated under reduced pressure, and the crude product is recrystallized by an initial dissolution in hot dichloromethane (5 mL) followed by the addition of ethyl acetate (10 mL) to afford between 600 mg to 750 mg (33-41% yield) of the (R,R)-(+)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyltartaric acid diamide and.
B. Methoxymethyl vinyl ether. A 200-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stopper, magnetic stirring bar, and an efficient reflux condenser that is attached through a thick rubber tube to a clean trap, cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath, whose outlet is equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube. The flask is charged with 74.2 g (440 mmol) of 2-bromoethyl methoxymethyl ether, 58 g (880 mmol) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets, and 7.09 g (2.2 mmol) of tris[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethyl]amine (TDA-1). The mixture is heated to 140°C with stirring. The clear liquid phase gradually becomes cloudy and begins to reflux. After heating for 27 hr, consumption of the starting material is confirmed by GLC. The calcium chloride tube is replaced with an additional cold trap that is attached to a water aspirator. The reaction mixture is cooled to 110°C and a vacuum is applied using the water aspirator for 2 hr, during which time volatile material is collected in the first cold trap. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the first trap is disconnected and allowed to warm to room temperature. The liquid is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask. A small amount of water (about 1 mL) is usually present and is removed with a syringe. The organic layer is distilled at atmospheric pressure into an ice-cooled receiver to afford 26.6–28.2 g (69–72%) of methoxymethyl vinyl ether as a colorless liquid, bp 64–70°C. The product is dried and kept over 4 Å molecular sieves.
A. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone.2 3 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an argon inlet adaptor, a low temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with tetrahydrofuran (1.1 L) and triphenylphosphine (42.1 g, 160 mmol). The triphenylphosphine is dissolved with stirring, and the flask is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath maintained at that temperature. Distilled diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) (27.86 g, 160 mmol) is then added dropwise with a syringe over 10 min. The resulting pale yellow solution is stirred at −75°C to −78°C for 10 min, at which point a milky slurry is obtained. The rubber septum on the flask is quickly replaced with a 1-L, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing a solution of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-serine (32.8 g, 160 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (240 mL), and which is then added dropwise to the mixture over 30 min. After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at −75°C to −78°C for 20 min, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is slowly warmed with stirring to room temperature over 2.5 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 35°C. The residual pale yellow syrup is suspended in hexane/ethyl acetate (85/15, 20 mL), slurried, and the solid is removed by filtration. The filtrate is diluted with ethyl acetate (30 mL) to give a solution which is applied to a 10 × 23-cm column of flash silica gel4 (800 g) packed in hexane/ethyl acetate (85/15). The flask and the sides of the column are rinsed with additional ethyl acetate (20 mL), which is added to the column that is then eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate (85/15, 2.7 L). The solvent is changed to hexane/ethyl acetate (7/3) and 500-mL fractions are collected. Concentration of fractions 6–12 on a rotary evaporator gives 12.07 (40%) of pure N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone and.
C. t-Butyl diazoacetate. Into a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed a solution of 92.6 (0.50 mole) of t-butyl α-diazoacetoacetate in 150 ml. of methanol. After this solution has been cooled to 2–3° in an ice bath, a solution of sodium methoxide, prepared from 11.5 g. (0.50 g. atom) of sodium and 150 ml. of methanol, is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the reaction mixture remains within the temperature range 0–5° (about 30 minutes is required for the addition). After the addition is completed, the mixture is stirred in the ice bath for an additional 30 minutes. The red reaction solution is poured into 1 l. of ice water, and the resulting mixture is extracted with 500 ml. of ether. The aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with two 500-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with 500 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After the mixture has been filtered and the residue has been washed with ether, the bulk of the solvent is removed from the combined ethereal filtrates at 30° and water aspirator pressure with a rotary evaporator. The remaining ether is removed by distillation under slightly reduced pressure while the stillpot is heated with a water bath at 50°. The residual red oil is distilled. (Caution! See above.). After a small forerun the diazo ester distills during which time the temperature of the water bath is raised from 60° to 75°. The yield is 48–50 g. (68–70%) of yellow-orange liquid, b.p. 51–53° (12 mm.), n20D 1.4551, Rf = 0.56 (chloroform).
Urea (4.0 g., 0.067 mole) is dissolved in 50 ml. of distilled ethylene glycol contained in a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Finely divided recrystallized tetracyanoethylene (p. 877) (25.6 g., 0.20 mole) is added, and the flask is heated on a steam bath at 70–75° with frequent stirring by hand with a thermometer until solution is complete (about 15 minutes). The resultant brownish yellow solution is then cooled in ice water, and the precipitated dicyanoketene ethylene acetal is collected on a Büchner funnel. The acetal is first washed with two 25-ml. portions of cold ethylene glycol and then washed thoroughly with cold water to remove the ethylene glycol. The dicyanoketene ethylene acetal, which may be dried in air or in a vacuum desiccator, is obtained in the form of large slightly pink needles, m.p. 115–116.5°; yield 21–23 g. (77–85%).
A mixture of 28.6 g. (0.251 mole) of 2-heptanone, 51.0 g. (0.500 mole) of acetic anhydride, and 1.9 g. (0.010 mole) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate contained in a stoppered 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes before 55 g. (0.43 mole) of the solid 1:1 boron trifluoride-acetic acid complex is added, resulting in the evolution of heat. The amber-colored solution is stirred in the stoppered flask at room temperature for 16–20 hours, and a solution of 136 g. (1.00 mole) of sodium acetate trihydrate in 250 ml. of water is added. After the flask has been fitted with a reflux condenser, the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 3 hours and cooled, and the product is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°). The combined organic extracts are washed successively with aqueous 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate and saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate (Drierite). The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residual oil is distilled, yielding 25–30 g. (64–77%) of 3-n-butyl-2,4-pentanedione as a colorless liquid, b.p; 84–86° (6 mm.), nD25 1.4422–1.4462.

(5 ml./g.) of 70% sulfuric acid are heated in an oil bath; when the temperature of the bath reaches 175–180°, steam is passed rapidly through the mixture. The hydrolysis is continued in this way for 2 hours; small amounts of the dibromoaniline distil. The bath is then allowed to cool to 105–110°. At this temperature the main mass of the product is steam-distilled. The slightly colored 2,6-dibromoaniline melts at 84–86° and weighs 25–30 g. (66–79% based on 3,5-dibromosulfanilamide). It may be purified by recrystallization from 70% alcohol (7 ml./g.); after recrystallization the product is obtained as long colorless needles which melt at 87–88°. The recovery is 85–90%.
The crude, moist sulfonamide is dissolved in 1.6 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid by warming on the steam bath for 15 minutes. The sulfuric acid solution is divided into two equal parts, each of which is placed in a 4-l. beaker. The beakers are cooled in ice baths while 1.6 kg. of ice is added slowly and with stirring to the contents of each beaker. During the addition of the ice, phenyl p-tolyl sulfone separates. A total of 50 g. of Norit is added, and the solution is filtered and.
The crude quinone is dissolved in 250 ml. of chloroform and added to a solution of 40 g. of sodium hydrosulfite in 300 ml. of water.

C. (R)-(+)-2-(Diphenylhydroxymethyl)pyrrolidine. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 325 mL of absolute ethanol and NaOH (27.0 g, 675 mmol). The NaOH is dissolved with vigorous stirring, and (R)-(+)-2-(diphenylhydroxymethyl)-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pyrrolidine (22.0 g, 62.3 mmol) is added. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the resulting milky white suspension is heated to reflux for 2.5 hr. The suspension is cooled to room temperature, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure. To the residual off-white solids are added ether (800 mL) and deionized water (400 mL). The suspension is stirred until the solids are dissolved, and the resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The layers are partitioned, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (4 × 200 mL). The organic phases are combined, dried over K2CO3 (ca. 100 g), filtered, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure to afford 14.5–15.8 g (92–100%) of the pure title compound as a white solid.
A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. Sodium hydride dispersion, [19.2 g. of a 50% w/w suspension in mineral oil, 9.6 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium hydride] is placed in the flask, and 100 ml. of anhydrous pentane is added. After the dispersion has been stirred, the sodium hydride is allowed to settle, and the supernatant liquid is removed with a pipet or a siphon. This washing operation is repeated with two additional 100-ml. portions of pentane, and 400 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide is then added to the reaction flask. To the vigorously stirred suspension of sodium hydride in N,N-dimethylformamide is added, dropwise over 30 minutes, 68 g. (0.60 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate. The mixture is stirred until a clear solution is obtained before all of the previously prepared crude (E)-4-hexen-1-yl p-toluenesulfonate, dissolved in 100 ml. of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide, is added in one portion. The resulting solution is slowly heated to 100°, with continuous stirring, over a period of 3 hours. During this time the reaction becomes dark red, and crystalline sodium p-toluenesulfonate separates. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature, then transferred to a 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, and most of the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual semisolid is mixed with 700 ml. of water and extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column. After removal of a low-boiling forerun, b.p. 54–57° (0.2 mm.), containing mainly ethyl cyanoacetate, 34.5–38.4 g.

A. (Z)-1,1,1-Trifluoro-2-ethoxy-5-phenyl-2-pentene (3). A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring and with a rubber septum, argon inlets, and calcium chloride drying tube, is flushed with dry argon and charged with 2.31 g (77 mmol) of an 80% suspension of sodium hydride (NaH) in mineral oil. The suspension is washed free of oil with two portions of dry pentane . The flask is then charged with 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 32.3 g (70 mmol) of 3-phenylpropyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (1), and equipped with a condenser bearing the calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is stirred under reflux for 5 hr and then cooled to ~ 0°C with an ice bath. By syringe, 10.0 g (70 mmol) of ethyl trifluoroacetate (2) is slowly added through the septum inlet to the stirred reaction mixture. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hr, cooled, and diluted with 300 mL of pentane . The supernatant liquid from the resulting suspension is decanted and filtered through a short silica gel column. The residual solids are washed twice with 50 mL of pentane , and the combined pentane solutions are passed through the same column. The column is then eluted with 200 mL of a 5:1 (v/v) mixture of pentane-diethyl ether . Evaporation of the solvents from the combined eluates under reduced pressure and bulb-to-bulb vacuum distillation of the residual liquid (oven temperature 120-130°C at 10 mm) provides 12.0-12.8 g (70-75%) of 97% pure (by gas chromatography) (Z)-1,1,1-trifluoro-2-ethoxy-5-phenyl-2-pentene (3) as a clear, colorless liquid, bp 80°C (10 mm).
A 4-L beaker equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and thermometer is charged with a solution of 125 g of ferrous sulfate and 50 g of tartaric acid in a total volume of 500 mL of deionized water. The solution is stirred and cooled by means of an ice–water bath to 10°C. When the epoxidation reaction mixture reaches 0°C, it is immediately poured into the stirred contents of the beaker. The resulting reaction is mildly exothermic, causing a temperature rise to ca. 20°C. After the exothermic reaction has subsided and the temperature has begun to drop (ca. 5 min), the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min. The contents of the beaker are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 250-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 35°C (70 mm) to give 85.9–89.9 g of pale-amber oil.
(C) Dimethylhydrazine Dihydrochloride.—In a 2-l. flask, a mixture of 67 g. (0.25 mole) of dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine and 250 cc. of 32 per cent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.16) is refluxed gently for two hours under a hood. To remove the benzoic acid, the mixture is steam-distilled until 10 l. of distillate has collected; the residual liquor is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath. The crystalline dihydrochloride is treated with 25 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, and the mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. This treatment is repeated, and the dihydrochloride is crushed with a mixture of 25 cc. of absolute alcohol and 2–3 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, filtered, and washed with 10–15 cc. of cold absolute alcohol. The first fraction of dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride, after being dried in a vacuum desiccator, weighs 22–23 g. By evaporation of the mother liquors and further treatment with 5–6 cc. of absolute alcohol and a little hydrochloric acid, a second fraction of 3 g. of the hydrochloride is obtained. Repetition of this procedure yields a third fraction amounting to about 0.5 g.. The total yield is 25–26 g. (75–78 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After cooling to 20°C, the solution is filtered through a 1-cm mat of Celite pressed into a coarse-porosity sintered-glass filter. The yellow filtrate is cooled to 10°C (with an ice bath and magnetic stirring) and 37.3 g (0.21 mol) of hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) is added dropwise over 5 min, resulting in the formation of a yellow crystalline precipitate. Stirring is continued for a total of 15 min at 10°C, and the product is filtered using a Büchner funnel and pressed dry with a spatula. After 30 min in the funnel (aspirator vacuum), the filtercake is transferred to a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask. Methanol (20 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred in the 40°C bath. More methanol is slowly added until the crystals have dissolved. Cooling the saturated solution in the refrigerator gives yellow needles. The crystal mass is broken up with a spatula, the product is filtered and washed with 20–30 mL of cold methanol to give MoO5·H2O·HMPA, 46–50 g (59–64%) and.
B. 1-Phenylnaphthalene. A mixture of 6 g. (0.18 mole) of powdered sulfur and 35 g. (0.17 mole) of 1-phenyldialin in a 200-ml. Claisen flask having a modified side arm is heated for 30 minutes in a metal bath the temperature of which is 250–270°. At the end of this time the evolution of hydrogen sulfide will have ceased. The heavy oil is then distilled from the same flask; the yield is 32–33 g. (91–94%); the boiling range of the product is 134–135°/2 mm. or 189–190°/12 mm. and"/>.
The pressure vessel is heated with agitation at 100° for 4 hours and at 130° for 6 hours. The vessel is allowed to cool to room temperature and the volatile by-products [ Caution! Toxic!] are vented. The crude, fuming, liquid product is poured into a stirred suspension of 10 g. of finely divided sodium fluoride in 60 ml. of pentane, the mixture is filtered, and the filtrate is fractionated through a 6-in. Vigreux column. 1,1,1-Trifluoroheptane is collected at 100–101°/760 mm., nD25 1.3449. The yield is 21.7–24.6 g. (70–80%).
The distillate is then dried over solid potassium hydroxide for twenty-four hours and finally over metallic sodium. The allylamine is distilled from a water bath held at 70–78°, through a 12-in. fractionating column, into a receiver immersed in an ice bath. Two fractions are collected: up to 54°/746 mm., and 54–57°/746 mm. The lower fraction amounts to 14–16 g. and on redistillation yields 6–8 g. of pure material. The total yield of pure allylamine boiling at 54–57°/746 mm. is 200–210 g. (70–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 5-(3,4-Dimethoxybenzyl)-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (1). An oven-dried 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an oval magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum and a two-tap Schlenk adaptor connected to a bubbler and an nitrogen/vacuum manifold is charged with 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (20.0 g, 120 mmol, 1.0 equiv), 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum's acid) (17.7 g, 123 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and ethanol (250 mL) and) by temporary removal of the septum. After complete dissolution of the reactants, piperidine (1.2 mL, 12.3 mmol, 0.1 equiv) and acetic acid (0.7 mL, 12.3 mmol, 0.1 equiv) are added sequentially by syringe and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Sodium triacetoxyborohydride (52.1 g, 246 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is then added in four equal portions, one after the other on a 30 min interval by temporarily removing the septum. The reaction mixture is stirred for another 60 min at room temperature, after which it is cooled using an ice bath and quenched by the addition of saturated ammonium chloride solution (60 mL).
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a gas-inlet tube, a rubber septum, a reflux condenser connected to a mineral oil bubbler, and a sealed mechanical stirrer. The system is flamed with a Bunsen burner as it is flushed with dry nitrogen. The reaction vessel is cooled under nitrogen in an ice bath, and 7.25 g. (0.125 mole) of 2-propen-1-ol, 70 ml. of pentane, and 1.16 g. (0.0100 mole) of N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-1,2-ethanediamine are added successively through the rubber septum with a syringe. While maintaining a positive nitrogen pressure, 180 ml. of 1.5 M (0.270 mole) n-butyllithium in pentane is added from a syringe over a 20-minute period. The ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour. The ice bath is then restored, the gas-inlet tube replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 70 ml. of water is added, cautiously at first, and then more rapidly after the exothermic reaction ceases. The resulting mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the pentane layer is washed with a 10-ml. portion of 3 N hydrochloric acid, then two 10-ml. portions of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. Distillation of the residual oil through a short-path distillation apparatus yields 9.3–9.6 g. (64–66%) of 2-methyl-1-hexanol, b.p. 166–167° and.
The stirrer and thermometer are removed and the flask is fitted with a condenser for reflux. The mixture is heated under reflux for 15 minutes, and the solution, while still hot (90°), is acidified by the cautious addition of 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The clear yellow solution is kept at 5° for 24 hours. The crystalline precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried at 100° at atmospheric pressure. The yield of 3β-hydroxyetienic acid, m.p. 274–276°, is 18–20 g. An additional 3–5 g. of product can be obtained by subjecting the filtrate to steam distillation until a white precipitate is formed. The etienic acid collected from the cooled solution melts at 268–272°. The total yield is 23–24 g. (91–95%).
B. Methyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylidenacetate. A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 60 mL of methylene chloride, 3.5 g of a strongly acidic ion-exchange resin, and 11.0 g (0.057 mol) of trimethyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylidenorthoacetate. The mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature. The ion-exchange resin is removed by filtration and washed with three 10-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove the solvent. The residue is distilled through a short-path column under reduced pressure to give 6.2–6.7 g (74–80%) of methyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylidenacetate, bp 95–97°C (10 mm),(Note 7)(Note 8).
To a solution of 500 g. (1.46 moles) of cane sugar in 1 l. of water in a 2-l. flask is added 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.16). The flask is heated on a steam bath for twenty-four hours, during which time considerable carbonization takes place. The black solid is filtered off with suction and washed with 300 cc. of water. The filtrate is placed in a large evaporating dish on a steam bath and allowed to evaporate overnight. The black solid residue obtained on the following morning is ground to a powder and placed in a folded filter paper of 34-cm. diameter. This is placed in a 25-cm. funnel fitted with a water-cooled 12-l. flask as described on p. 375. The solid is extracted with 500 cc. of ether for six to eight hours. The ether is distilled and the residue fractionated under reduced pressure. The fraction distilling at 150–160°/15 mm. or 135–140°/10 mm. forms a rather dark liquid which does not completely solidify on cooling.
In a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a gas-inlet tube are placed 45.6 g. (0.4 mole) of 2-chloropyrimidine (p. 182) and 150 ml. of absolute ethanol. The mixture is refluxed for 6 hours while anhydrous dimethylamine is bubbled into the solution. The solution is cooled, and 100 ml. of ethanol is removed by distillation using a water aspirator. The residue is chilled in an ice bath for 1 hour, and 75 ml. of ether is added to cause precipitation of dimethylamine hydrochloride. After the removal of dimethylamine hydrochloride and solvent, the residue is distilled at reduced pressure from a Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 85–86°/28 mm. is collected; yield 40–42.5 g. (81–86%), n25D 1.5420.
B. 2-(4-Methoxyphenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-one . A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 1.5-in. Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and an argon inlet adaptor, is charged with 10.02 g (45.1 mmol) of 2-iodo-2-cyclohexen-1-one , 10.69 g (70.4 mmol, 1.56 eq) of 4-methoxyphenylboronic acid, 16.72 g (72.1 mmol, 1.6 eq) of silver(I) oxide (Ag2O), 0.85 g (2.8 mmol, 6 mol %) of triphenylarsine, 0.53 g (1.4 mmol, 3 mol %) of palladium(II) bis(benzonitrile)dichloride, 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 25 mL of water. The reaction mixture, flushed with argon, is stirred for 1 hr and then quenched by the addition of 125 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride . After the solution is stirred for 1 hr, the resulting two-phase mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel. The upper (organic) and lower (aqueous) phases are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with 300-mL portions of diethyl ether . The combined organic phases are washed successively with two 500-mL portions of water and 200 mL of brine . The resulting organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid.
The resulting mixture is then heated on a steam cone or an air bath with constant stirring until the temperature of the mixture reaches 70°. The mixture is filtered, while hot, through a previously heated Büchner funnel. The filtrate is immediately placed in a large beaker or evaporating dish for the crystallization of the diacetonamine hydrogen oxalate. The residue is treated with boiling alcohol and filtered, the filtrate containing a small additional quantity of the amine hydrogen oxalate. The mother liquor is distilled until nothing further passes over at 78°, and the residue is allowed to stand for a day in a cool place. The crystals that separate are washed with cold absolute alcohol and dried. A total yield of 285–320 g. (63–70 per cent of the theoretical amount) of product that melts at 126–127° is obtained.
A 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a gas outlet tube protected by a calcium chloride drying tower is surrounded by an ice-water bath. The system is flushed slowly with acetylene for 3 minutes. Carbon tetrachloride (260 g.) is poured into the flask, and acetylene is bubbled through at a saturation rate for 3 minutes. Aluminum chloride (98 g., 0.74 mole) is added, and acetylene is bubbled continuously through the mixture with stirring for 5 minutes.
Five hundred forty-five grams (4.00 moles) of 2,4,6-trimethylphenol is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 90-cm. Vigreux column, and dropping funnel (not of the pressure-equalizing variety). The Vigreux column must extend sufficiently into the top of a well-ventilated hood to entrain effectively the fumes that will be generated later in the operation. The phenol is melted with the aid of an external oil bath or Glascol® heating mantle and heated to about 100°. The heating bath is removed, and 27.6 g. (1.20 g. atoms) of sodium in cubes about 1 cm. on a side or smaller is added to the stirred mixture at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 150–160°. The molten mass gradually becomes dark red in color as the sodium dissolves. While the addition and solution of the sodium is proceeding, a cold solution of about 0.25 mole of chloramine in 250 ml. of ether is prepared.
The residual mixture is allowed to cool, and the phthalic acid which crystallizes is removed by filtration and washed with 350 ml. of 1% hydrochloric acid. The combined filtrate and washings are distilled nearly to dryness on a steam bath under reduced pressure; the bulk of the hydrochloric and acetic acids remaining is removed by slowly adding 300 ml. of water through a dropping funnel while the distillation under reduced pressure is continued. The dark brown residue is warmed on a steam bath with 700 ml. of water, is allowed to cool, and is filtered to remove a small amount of black insoluble matter. The filtrate is decolorized with 2 g. of Norit, 200 ml. of hot water being used to wash the Norit. The volume of the combined filtrate and washings, amounting to about 1.2 l., is measured accurately, and a small portion is analyzed for chloride. An amount of pyridine corresponding exactly to the chloride content is added, diluted with 500 ml. of 95% ethanol. The DL-aspartic acid, which crystallizes at once, is separated by filtration after the mixture has stood for 24 hours at room temperature and is washed with 50–100 ml. of cold water.
C. N-Benzyl-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)azetidin-2-one . Into a flame-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser, addition funnel, and a large magnetic stirring bar, is placed 12.24 g (0.50 mol) of magnesium turnings and 400 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. tert-Butyl chloride (60.0 mL, 0.55 mol) is placed in the addition funnel and slowly added to the magnesium turnings as the reaction mixture spontaneously begins to reflux. When the addition is completed, heating is continued for 1 hr more. A solution of 30.0 g (0.13 mol) of methyl 2-(benzylamino)methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is slowly added dropwise to the well stirred Grignard solution over a period of 3 hr at room temperature. The mixture is then carefully neutralized with 300 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution and the separated aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 300 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (500 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting orange oil is purified by passing it down a short silica gel column (elution with 5% methanol in dichloromethane). The appropriate fractions are pooled and freed of solvent under reduced pressure to give 19.45-21.85 g (73-82%) of N-benzyl-3-(1-hydroxyethyl)azetidin-2-one as a yellowish oil.
The material is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 0.15 mm and an oven temperature of 95–105°C to give 15.0 g (59% overall yield) of material with GC purity of 98.3%.
The combined filtrates and washings for the two portions of the oxidation mixture are evaporated to a volume of about 4 l., and this solution is cooled in ice. The crystals which separate are filtered with suction, washed once with cold water, and dried. The yield is 70–80 g. of material having a melting point that may vary from 95 to 105°.
The mixture is allowed to cool, and 75 ml. of water is added slowly to destroy the acetic anhydride. Excess acetic acid and water are now removed on a boiling water bath under a pressure of approximately 35 mm. When the evaporation is complete, the residue will crystallize on cooling; this residue, which is almost pure bromoacetic acid, weighs 845–895 g..
B. Preparation of (R)-(+)-BINAP .3 An oven-dried, 250-mL, single-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with [1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane]nickel(II) chloride] (NiCl2dppe, 1.1 g, 2 mmol). The flask is purged with N2 (using a vacuum and nitrogen manifold) and anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF, 40 mL) is added via a syringe, followed by diphenylphosphine (2.0 mL, 12 mmol) at room temperature. The resulting dark red solution is heated at 100°C for 30 min. A solution of the chiral ditriflate of binaphthol (11.0 g, 20 mmol) and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO, 9.0 g, 80 mmol) in anhydrous, degassed DMF (60 mL) is transferred in one portion to the reaction flask via cannula, and the resulting dark green solution is kept at 100°C. Three additional portions of diphenylphosphine (3 × 2 mL) are added by syringe after 1 hr, 3 hr, and 7 hr. The reaction is heated at 100°C until the ditriflate of binaphthol is completely consumed (2ndash;3 days). The dark brown solution is cooled to −15 ~ −20°C with an ice/acetone bath and stirred for 2 hr. The product is filtered, and the solid is washed with methanol (2 × 20 mL) and dried under vacuum. The isolated product (9.6 g, 77%) is a white to off-white crystalline compound with a chemical purity of ~97 area% (HPLC, 220 nm) containing ~1% of the monooxide of BINAP,,,.4
Approximately 1.5 l. of anhydrous liquid ammonia is introduced into a dry 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser which is connected through a sodalime tube to a gas-absorption trap. Freshly cut sodium (47.2 g., 2.05 gram atoms) is converted to sodium amide by addition to the liquid ammonia in the presence of a small amount of ferric nitrate, according to p. 219. A 1-l. dropping funnel and a gas inlet tube connected to a source of dry nitrogen are attached to the third neck of the flask, and, after the blue color of the solution has disappeared and a gray suspension of sodium amide remains, 1.2 l. of dry ether is added as rapidly as the rate of vaporization of ammonia will permit. The ammonia is removed by warming the flask on a steam bath until refluxing of the ether occurs. Cyclohexanone (220 g., 2.24 moles) is added through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux on a steam bath for 3 hours. Nitrogen is then introduced through the gas inlet tube to maintain an inert atmosphere, and the mixture is cooled in an ice bath. A solution of 246 g. (2.03 moles) of allyl bromide in 1 l. of anhydrous ether is added rapidly through the dropping funnel with stirring. If the reaction does not start soon after the completion of this addition the mixture is warmed cautiously on the steam bath. When the exothermic reaction has started it is controlled by cooling in the ice bath while refluxing continues for 20–30 minutes. The mixture is finally heated under reflux on the steam bath for 3 hours.
The reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L, round-bottomed flask with ethanol washing and the ethanol is removed by rotatory evaporation. Diethyl ether (1 L) is added to precipitate the electrolyte salt, which is collected by filtration and washed with ether. The crude electrolyte is obtained as a white solid (32–32.5 g, theory 34.1 g). The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated to give a viscous brown oil, which was vacuum-distilled through a short Vigreux column (15 cm × 2.5 cm). After a forerun of 70 mL of material boiling below 150°C (0.15 mm), the product (92–96 g, 53–56%), bp 150–155°C (0.1 mm), is collected and. The forerun contained diethyl maleate, diethyl fumarate, diethyl succinate, and diethyl ethoxysuccinate. The product is a mixture of diastereomers; on standing some meso isomer, mp 74–75°C, crystallizes.
In a 3-l. Erlenmeyer flask are placed about 500 g. of crushed ice, 110 ml. (1.3 equivalents) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 100 ml. of ether. This mixture is vigorously swirled and shaken while the Grignard reaction mixture is cautiously added in small portions. More ice is added to the Erlenmeyer flask as required to keep the temperature near 0°. The resulting mixture is poured into a separatory funnel and shaken thoroughly. The water layer is separated and extracted three times with 100 ml. of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 100 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and then with 100 ml. of water. The solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the ether distilled on a water bath. The residue is fractionated at reduced pressure through a modified Claisen flask to yield 54–62 g. (68–78%) of sec-butyl 3-methylheptanoate, b.p. 92–93°/9 mm., n25D 1.4190.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient dry-ice condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a gas-inlet tube is immersed in an acetone–dry ice bath, and 600 ml. of anhydrous ammonia is introduced. After replacing the inlet tube with a stopper, the cooling bath is lowered but kept beneath the flask. To the slowly stirred ammonia is added 0.5 g. of hydrated iron(III) nitrate. Air, dried by passing through calcium chloride, is bubbled through the solution for about 10 seconds after a small piece of freshly cut sodium is added. Once hydrogen evolution has ceased, the blue color is discharged, leaving a finely divided, black precipitate. Small pieces of freshly cut sodium are then added over a 20 minute period until 36.0 g. (1.56 g.-atom) has been added. After the formation of sodium amide is complete, the stopper is replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 76.1 g. (0.499 mole) of chloroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal, and the addition is made over a period of 20 minutes. After 30–60 minutes the mixture becomes light gray, and 120 g. (1.10 mole) of freshly distilled ethyl bromide is added rapidly through the addition funnel. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 2.5 hours, after which 30 ml. of cooled, saturated ammonium chloride solution is cautiously added through the addition funnel, followed by 120 ml. of pentane and an additional 370 ml. of the cooled, saturated ammonium chloride solution. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel (in the hood); the lower aqueous layer is removed and extracted with two 75-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic layers are filtered through glass wool to dissipate any emulsions, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered through a coarse-fritted funnel with gentle suction into a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. A magnetic stirring bar is added, and the pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure through a 20 × 2 cm. column packed with glass beads and fitted with a well-cooled fractionating head. With an acetone–dry ice trap between the receiver and the vacuum source, the yellow residue is distilled under reduced pressure, with rapid magnetic stirring, into dry-ice-cooled receivers, giving 1-ethoxy-1-butyne as a clear, colorless liquid at 43–45° (50 mm.). A lower-boiling fraction collection at 20–42° (50 mm.) is combined with any material removed from the dry-ice trap and redistilled, yielding additional product, for a total of 30.2–32.3 g. (62–66%).
The dark red-brown reaction mixture is cautiously poured onto a mixture of 2 kg. of ice and 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated and discarded. The acid solution is extracted with three 500-ml. portions of ether, which are discarded; then it is treated with 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide until the aluminum hydroxide which first forms redissolves. After cooling, the organic material is extracted with five 300-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are washed with water, the solvent is removed by distillation on the steam bath, and the product is distilled. The yield of 3-benzoylpyridine, b.p. 107–110°/0.3 mm. or 141–145°/4 mm., is 165–175 g. (90–96%), nD26 1.6088.
In a dry 2-l. three-necked flask are placed 600 g. (4 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl benzoate and 60 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled acetophenone. The flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer which must be rugged enough to stir the reaction mixture even after it becomes very viscous. A condenser for downward distillation is attached to one of the necks, and a 500-ml. filter flask is used as the receiver. This receiver is connected to a water pump through a suction flask carrying a two-holed rubber stopper, one hole of which is left open. The reaction flask is heated in an oil bath kept at 150–160°, and, after the mixture is hot, 44 g. (0.65 mole) of sodium ethoxide is added through the third arm of the flask in 1- to 2-g. portions. The ethoxide addition can be conveniently accomplished with a spoon shaped to enter the arm of the flask or by placing a very short-stemmed large funnel in the third neck and pushing the ethoxide through the funnel with a small glass rod or wire spatula. The reaction mixture becomes orange immediately; ethanol distils after the first few additions, and thereafter the evolution of ethanol is quite vigorous. The additions are made as rapidly as evolution of the ethanol permits. During the ethoxide addition a gentle stream of air is kept passing through the flask by means of a water pump attached to the receiver in order to prevent the ethanol vapor from rising in the third arm of the flask and interfering with the addition.
A. 7,7-Dichloro-1-methylbicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel topped with a gas inlet, and a condenser connected to a Nujol-filled bubbler. The system is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is then charged with 10.0 g (ca. 150 mmol) of zinc–copper couple, 200 mL of anhydrous ether, and 10.5 mL (8.2 g, 100 mmol) of 1-methyl-1-cyclopentene, and the addition funnel is filled with a solution of 13.4 mL (21.8 g, 120 mmol) of trichloroacetyl chloride and 11.2 mL (18.4 g, 120 mmol) of phosphorus oxychloride in 100 mL of anhydrous ether. Magnetic stirring is begun and the solution is added dropwise over 1 hr to the reaction flask at room temperature. After being stirred for an additional 14 hr, the reaction mixture is filtered under water pump pressure through 30 g of filter aid, which is then washed with 120 mL of ether. The filtrate is concentrated to ca. 100–120 mL, treated with 400 mL of hexane, and then briefly stirred to precipitate the zinc chloride. The supernatant solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and the viscous residue is washed with two 75-mL portions of 3 : 1 hexane–ether. The combined solution is washed successively with 200 mL of cold water, 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and 2 × 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation at 25°C to give 17.0–17.8 g of a brown oil. Vacuum distillation of this material without fractionation provides 14.9–16.0 g (77–83%) of 7,7-dichloro-1-methylbicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one as a clear, light-yellow oil, bp 38°C (0.2 mm), nD20 1.4970.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed stirrer, a thermometer, and a connecting tube with parallel side arm to which is attached an addition funnel and a reflux condenser are placed 56 g. (0.81 mole) of 96% cyclopentadiene, 106 g. (1.0 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 500 ml. of methylene chloride. A solution of 2 g. of sodium acetate in 76 g. of 40% peracetic acid (0.40 mole) is added, with stirring, over a period of 30–45 minutes, and the temperature is maintained at 20° by intermittent external cooling. The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional hour at room temperature. The solid in the reaction is removed by suction filtration, and the filter cake is washed three times with 75 ml. of methylene chloride. The combined filtrate and washings are added, with rapid stirring, over a period of 1 hour, to 250 ml. of cold distilled water (maintained at 5–10° by external cooling) contained in a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a condenser, a sealed stirrer, and an addition funnel. The stirring is continued for 1 hour as the temperature is allowed to rise to room temperature, the layers are separated, and the lower methylene chloride layer is extracted twice with 25 ml. of distilled water. The aqueous extracts are combined with the aqueous phase obtained from the hydrolysis reaction, and the combined solution is distilled at approximately 30 mm. pressure to remove the water. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to give 26–28 g. of colorless oil, b.p. 82–105°/1 mm.. The yield of mixed cyclopentenediols is 65–70% based on the quantity of peracetic acid used.
C. Methyl n-hexylcarbamate. In a dry, 100-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, to which a calcium chloride drying tube is attached, are placed a boiling chip, 14.8 g. (0.0622 mole) of the inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide, and 6.0 g. (0.058 mole) of freshly distilled 1-hexanol. After a mildly exothermic reaction (occasionally there is a 5-minute induction period), the viscous, yellow reaction mixture is heated with an oil bath at 95° for 1 hour. The mixture is cooled to 30°, diluted with 50 ml. of water, and extracted with three 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic extracts are combined, washed successively with 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid and 50 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, dichloromethane is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residue is triturated with 50 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and filtered; the recovered solid is triturated with two further 50-ml. portions of ether. The three ethereal filtrates are combined and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, affording 8.0 g. of crude product. Fractionation of this oil through a short-path distillation apparatus gives 4.8–4.9 g. (51–52%) of methyl n-hexylcarbamate as a colorless oil, b.p. 59–60° (0.08 mm.); nD20 1.4361.
The carbon disulfide is distilled off; it amounts to about 1200 cc.. The residual liquid is then slowly distilled under reduced pressure with a good fractionating column in a 1.5- or 2-l. Claisen flask which must be slightly modified (Fig. 9, p. 130) so that the p-bromophenol after coming in contact with cork or rubber will not be carried into the condenser; if it does, it becomes pinkish. The yield is 1475–1550 g. (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of p-bromophenol boiling at 145–150° /25–30 mm. In addition, there is obtained 250–350 g. of lower-boiling material consisting of a mixture of o-bromophenol and p-bromophenol from which it is very difficult to extract either constituent in pure form, and a small quantity of high-boiling material consisting chiefly of 2,4-dibromophenol. The p-bromophenol on cooling solidifies to a solid white mass containing practically no oil. By centrifuging the product, perfectly dry white crystals are obtained, m.p. 63°. There is also produced in this preparation about 1.5–1.6 l. of hydrobromic acid with a specific gravity of about 1.3.
The 3-bromo-4-acetaminotoluene separates in crystalline flocks. It is filtered by suction and washed well with water and pressed dry. The wet crude material is dried until its weight does not exceed 500 g. before proceeding with the hydrolysis.
A small amount (50–100 g.) of higher-boiling material remains in the flask. This is mainly diphenyl sulfone, which may be isolated by distillation under reduced pressure (b.p. 225° /10 mm.) and recrystallization from methyl alcohol. It forms colorless crystals which melt at 128°.
B. Cholesterol from the dibromide. The acetic acid-moist filter cake of dibromide from 150 g. of cholesterol is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and covered with 1.2 l. of U.S.P. ether, and the suspension is stirred mechanically above a bucket of ice and water that can be raised as required,. Forty grams (0.61 g. atom) of fresh zinc dust is added in the course of 5 minutes. The first 5- to 10-g. portion is added without cooling; when the reaction has started, as evidenced by solution of part of the dibromide and by ebullition, the cooling bath is raised during the remainder of the addition. At the end, the ice bath is lowered, and the mixture, which soon sets to a paste of white solid, is stirred for 15 minutes longer. Then 50 ml. of water is added to dissolve the white solid, and the ethereal solution is decanted into a separatory funnel and washed with 400 ml. of water containing 25 ml. of 36% hydrochloric acid. After three more washings with 400-ml. portions of water, the solution is shaken thoroughly with 300 ml. of water and 150 ml. of 25% sodium hydroxide solution, and the ethereal solution is tested with moist blue litmus paper to make sure that all the acetic acid is removed. The solution is then dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to a volume of 600 ml., methanol (600 ml.) is added, and the solution is evaporated to the point where crystallization just begins (about 1 l.). After standing at room temperature and then at 0–4°, the main crop of cholesterol is collected and dried at room temperature; yield 108–110 g., m.p. 149.5–150°. A second crop of 8.4–10.4 g., m.p. 148–149°, is obtained after evaporation of the mother liquor to a volume of 250 ml.; total yield 117–120 g. (78–80% from commercial cholesterol).
When one-half the sodium cyanide solution has been added, all the ammonium chloride will be in solution. At this point, the addition of 380 cc. of glacial acetic acid is started at such a rate (2–2.5 cc. per minute) that the addition of both the acid and the remainder of the sodium cyanide solution will be completed at the same time. The methyleneaminoacetonitrile begins to separate in white crystals shortly after the addition of the glacial acetic acid has commenced. After all the sodium cyanide solution and acetic acid have been added, the mixture is stirred for one and one-half hours longer; then the precipitate is filtered off, transferred to a beaker, and stirred with 1.5 l. of water. The product is filtered with suction, washed with 500 cc. of water, and dried on filter paper. The yield is 410–475 g. (61–71 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 129°,, and.
The combined organic phases are washed with 50 mL of saturated potassium carbonate solution and dried over solid potassium carbonate. Evaporation with a rotary evaporator affords 13.7 g of crude product. The residue is put on a column (silica, 3 × 10 cm) and eluted with 600 mL of ether–pentane–triethylamine (47.5 : 47.5 : 5). The main fractions are collected to give 8.15 g (73%) of essentially pure E-1-acetoxy-4-diethylamino-2-butene (>94% E). No 1,2-isomer could be detected. The product is further purified by Kugelrohr distillation to afford 7.81–8.21 g (70–74%).
A. 2-(2-Bromoethyl)-1,3-dioxane (1). A 2-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and gas inlet tube. In the flask are placed 750 mL of dichloromethane, 112 g (2.00 mol) of acrolein, and 0.10 g of dicinnamalacetone indicator under nitrogen. The yellow solution is cooled to 0–5°C with an ice bath. Gaseous hydrogen bromide is bubbled into the solution with stirring until the indicator becomes deep red. The ice bath is removed and 1.0 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and 152.2 g (2.00 mol, 144 mL) of 1,3-propanediol are added. The yellow solution is stirred at room temperature for 8 hr and then concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual oil is washed with two 250-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Vacuum distillation through a 30-cm Vigreux column yields 252 g (65%) of 1 as a colorless liquid, bp 72–75°C (2.0 mm), nD2 1.4809.
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with a 250-mL addition funnel and a distillation assembly set for downward distillation to a 500-mL receiver flask. Rubber septa are used to isolate the system from atmospheric contact. Under a nitrogen purge, vented to an exhaust hood through a mercury bubbler, the entire system is thoroughly flame-dried. After the 2-L flask is cooled to room temperature, it is charged with 500 mL of pure, dry 1,2-dimethoxyethane and 153 mL (1.53 mol) of borane-methyl sulfide complex employing a double-ended needle to effect the transfer. With a similar technique, 164 g (1.52 mol) of 1,5-cyclooctadiene is transferred to the addition funnel. To the stirred borane solution, 1,5-cyclooctadiene is added dropwise over ca. 1 hr to maintain a reaction temperature of 50–60°C during which time a small amount of dimethyl sulfide (bp 38°C) distills slowly from the reaction mixture. After the addition is completed, the addition funnel is replaced with a glass stopper and approximately 300 mL of the solution is distilled to reach a final distillation temperature of 85°C, indicating the complete removal of dimethyl sulfide from the reaction mixture. If the distillate temperature does not reach 85°C, 150 mL of additional 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added and the distillation is continued until the distillate temperature reaches 85°C. The distillation assembly is replaced with a rubber septum and 1,2-dimethoxyethane is added to the reaction flask to bring the total liquid volume to 1 L. The mixture is warmed to effect the dissolution of the solid and allowed to cool very slowly to 0°C, which results in the formation of crystalline 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN) dimer. The supernatant liquid is decanted from the product using a double-ended needle and the 9-BBN dimer is dissolved in 1 L of fresh 1,2-dimethoxyethane. After the flask is cooled to 0°C, the supernatant liquid is removed as above and the large needles are dried under reduced pressure for 12 hr at 0.1 mm to give 158–165 g (85–89%) of product (mp 152–154°C, sealed capillary),(Note 7),(Note 8).
The reaction mixture is decanted into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask which is attached to a fractionating column. The solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure while the oil bath is heated finally at 160°. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to furnish four fractions: (a) acetic acid and other materials boiling below 95°/16 mm.; (b) ethyl cyanoacetate, b.p. 95–110°/16 mm.; (c) intermediate, b.p. 110–124°/16 mm.; and (d) ethyl sec-butylidenecyanoacetate, b.p. 124–126°/16 mm., nD25 1.4640–1.4648. Fraction d amounts to 117–122 g., and refractionation of fraction c yields an additional 18–24 g.; total yield, 135–146 g. (81–87.5%).
The mixture is transferred (Hood) while still hot to a fluted filter paper in a 20-cm. glass funnel, leaving behind as much mercury as possible. The funnel is made part of a special extraction apparatus as described on p. 375. The diphenylmercury is extracted with 600 cc. of boiling benzene for about ten hours.
The reaction mixture, which becomes rather dark, is diluted with an equal volume of cold water and cooled to 0° or below. The solution is filtered; the precipitate is washed several times with ice water and then dissolved in 1600 cc. of boiling water. This solution is filtered as rapidly as possible through a large folded filter, preferably with a steam funnel. In spite of all precautions, however, some solid usually separates on the filter. This must be redissolved in a minimum quantity of boiling water, and this solution then filtered into the main solution. The p-nitrophenylacetic acid separates in long, pale yellow needles, which melt at 151–152°. The yield is 103–106 g. (92–95 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Diethyl tert-butylmalonate. A 1-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen inlet tube is dried in an oven at 110–120°, then flushed with nitrogen and allowed to cool; an atmosphere of nitrogen is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the subsequently described reactions. After 18.3 g. (0.753 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings have been placed in the flask, a solution of 113.5 g. (0.7993 mole) of methyl iodide in 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added dropwise with stirring. The resulting solution of methylmagnesium iodide is cooled to 0–5° with an external ice–salt bath, and 1.0 g. (0.010 mole) of copper(I) chloride is introduced with stirring. The temperature of the resulting mixture is kept at −5° to 0° while a solution of 100 g. (0.500 mole) of diethyl isopropylidenemalonate in 100 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, dropwise and with stirring over a period of 80–90 minutes. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed; the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and poured onto a mixture of 500–1000 g. of ice and 400 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled through a short Vigreux column, yielding 93.5–102 g. (87–94%) of diethyl tert-butylmalonate as a colorless liquid, b.p. 60–61° (0.7 mm.), n20D 1.4250.
D. 3-Benzyl-3-methylpentanoic acid. A solution of 112 g. (1.6 moles) of potassium hydroxide (85%) in 400 ml. of ethylene glycol is added to 93.6 g. (0.5 mole) of 3-benzyl-3-methylpentanenitrile in a 1-l. round-bottomed copper or stainless-steel flask. A condenser with a rubber stopper is attached, and the solution is heated under brisk reflux for 6 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled, diluted with 400 ml. of water, and extracted with three portions of ether (250 ml., 100 ml., 100 ml.). The ether extracts are washed successively with two 75-ml. portions of water and then discarded.
The crude product is purified by dissolving it in an equal volume of methyl alcohol and then cooling the solution in a freezing mixture until crystallization is complete. The crystals are filtered with suction, and the mother liquors are again cooled in a freezing mixture. If necessary this process is repeated a third time or until no further crop of crystals separates on chilling the mother liquors. The crystals are transferred from the funnel to a beaker, stirred with about 70 cc. of petroleum ether (b.p. 32–45°), filtered, pressed dry, and washed with a little petroleum ether. The yield of fine, snow-white crystals melting at 43–45° is about 40–42 g. (40–42 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The crude carbinol is acetylated and dehydrated by refluxing its solution in 1 l. of glacial acetic acid and 500 ml. of acetic anhydride for 1 hour. The solution is then concentrated to about 500 ml. by distillation. After cooling overnight, the crystalline 3,12-diacetoxy-bisnor-cholanyldiphenylethylene is collected on a filter and washed with acetic acid. The yield is 95–105 g. (63.5–70.0%) of material melting at 154–157°. This product is sufficiently pure to be used for the preparation of nor-desoxycholic acid (p. 234); one crystallization from acetone gives white crystals which melt at 156–157.5°; fully purified material melts at 159.5–160.5°.
Alternatively, the crude vinyl ether (0.81 g.) is transferred with petroleum ether into a 50-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a long gas-inlet tube. After the petroleum ether is removed at reduced pressure, the flask is filled with argon and heated under a positive argon pressure at 220–225° for 5 hours; little or no bubbling should occur. After cooling, the oil is chromatographed on 75 g. of silica gel using 10% diethyl ether in petroleum ether as the elution solvent,,. The first 175 ml. of eluant contains side products and is discarded; elution with another 175 ml. of the solvent gives 0.45–0.55 g. (50–53% overall yield from cholest-4-en-3β-ol) of 5β-cholest-3-ene-5-acetaldehyde as white prisms, m.p. 66.5–68°.
Three grams (0.13 atom) of metallic sodium is dissolved by warming for one-half hour in 70 g. (0.65 mole) of pure benzyl alcohol, and after the mixture has cooled to room temperature the solution is added gradually, with thorough mixing, to 454 g. (4.3 moles) of c.p. benzaldehyde (which must contain less than 1 per cent of benzoic acid). The reaction mixture has a tendency to become warm, but the temperature should be kept slightly below 50–60° by cooling, if necessary. A pasty gelatinous mass results. After about one-half hour the temperature of the mixture no longer rises; it is then warmed on the water bath for about one or two hours, with occasional shaking.
A. (Tributylstannyl)methanol. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, an argon inlet adapter, and a 150-mL, pressure-equalizing, dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 13.7 mL (0.098 mol) of diisopropylamine and 120 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and then cooled with an ice-water bath while 58.4 mL (0.093 mol) of a 1.60 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is added dropwise via syringe over 15 min. After 30 min, a solution of 24.75 g (0.0850 mol) of tributyltin hydride in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 50 min. After 30 min, 3.57 g (0.119 mol) of paraformaldehdye is added in one portion, the ice bath is removed, and the heterogeneous yellow reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature. The resulting clear, colorless solution is diluted with 500 mL of petroleum ether and washed with 300 mL of water. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with 150 mL of petroleum ether, and the combined organic layers are washed with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to afford approximately 30 g of (tributylstannyl)methanol as a colorless oil, which was used in the next step without further purification.
B. tert-Butylphthalimide. Thirty-five grams (0.3 mole) of tert-butylurea and 100 g. (0.675 mole) of phthalic anhydride are ground together in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask which is then immersed in a metal bath previously heated to 200°. The mixture melts and effervesces vigorously; after 10 minutes the temperature of the bath is raised to 240° (internal temperature 200°) and held there for 5 minutes. The flask is removed and cooled to 60–70°, and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to dissolve the contents partially. A 20% solution of sodium carbonate is added until the solution is alkaline to litmus paper, and the mixture is diluted with water to 1 l. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel with the aid of suction and pressed as dry as possible. The filter cake is warmed on a steam bath with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) in a 1 l. flask, and the hot mixture is filtered. Any water layer that may separate from the filtrate is removed, and the filtrate is cooled to 25° and again filtered. The clear filtrate is concentrated by distillation to about one-third of its original volume and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The crystalline material is collected on a filter, and as much as possible of the solvent is removed by suction. After air drying, this first crop weighs 40–43 g. and melts at 58–59°. By concentration of the filtrate an additional 2–4 g. may be obtained. The total yield of tert-butylphthalimide is 43–46.5 g. (72–76%).
The water-dihydropyran fraction separates into two layers. The lower aqueous layer is separated and discarded. The upper layer, consisting of fairly pure dihydropyran, is dried over 5–6 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, decanted, refluxed for 1 hour with 2–3 g. of metallic sodium, and then distilled from sodium. The yield is 110–118 g. of dihydropyran, boiling at 84–86° (66–70%).
(B) From Cholesteryl Acetate.—Five grams of cholesteryl acetate and 0.1 g. of platinum oxide are suspended in 25 cc. of absolute ether and 50 cc. of purified glacial acetic acid, and the hydrogenation is conducted at room temperature at a slight positive pressure. The reaction is complete in ten to fifty minutes. The solution is filtered, using ether to dissolve any crystallized material, and, after removing the solvent by distillation at reduced pressure, the residue is either saponified as above or purified in the following manner.
After the mixture has been cooled to 15–20° it is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and the crude product is washed first with two 1-l. portions of water cooled to 5–15°, then with 500 ml. of cold 10% potassium carbonate solution, and finally with 500 ml. of cold water. The product is the lower layer in all the washings. After the addition of 200 ml. of ether, the solution is given a preliminary drying by being allowed to stand over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, with frequent shaking, for 1 hour. The lower aqueous layer which forms is separated, and the ether solution is again dried over 20 g. of potassium carbonate for 8–10 hours and.
B. (E)-tert-Butyl benzylidenecarbamate (2).3 A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a reflux condenser capped with an inlet adaptor connected to an argon-vaccum manifold, is charged with anhydrous potassium carbonate (71.48 g, 517.2 mmol, 6.0 equiv). The solid is placed under vacuum (0.5 mmHg) and flame-dried. The flask is purged with argon and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (600 mL) is added via cannula under argon at 25 °C. Then, the septum is removed and compound 1 (29.95 g, 86.20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added into the flask. The septum is exchanged for a glass stopper, and the resulting suspension is heated to reflux at 80-85 °C (oil bath temp) with vigorous stirring under argon. After 15 h, the reaction is cooled to 25 °C and the solid is filtered off through alternating layers of Celite (1 cm thick)/Na2SO4 (1 cm thick)/Celite (1 cm thick) using a Büchner funnel (diameter 100 mm), and washed with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated at 30 °C (water bath temperature) by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg) and dried under vacuum (0.5 mmHg) to give 17.68 g (>99%) of the corresponding N-Boc-imine 2 as colorless oil.
After 45 min at reflux, a reaction aliquot checked by 1H NMR indicates that the reaction is complete, and. The heat source is removed and 350 mL of water is added while the mixture is still hot. The nitrogen gas source is removed and the reaction is allowed to stir open to the atmosphere for 2.5 hr while cooling to room temperature. The darkened mixture is diluted with 500 mL of ethyl acetate and transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The two phases are separated and the aqueous layer is back-extracted with two additional 250-mL portions of ethyl acetate . The combined organic layers are washed with 250 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) followed by saturated brine, 2 × 250 mL. The organic solution is placed in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask with a magnetic stirring bar, treated with 25.0 g of Darco G-60 and stirred at room temperature for 30 min. To the mixture is added 50.0 g of sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 200-cc. dropping funnel and a 30-cm. column filled with glass beads, and connected to a 40–50 cm. condenser, are placed 124 g. (2 moles) of boric acid, 666 g. (9 moles) of technical n-butyl alcohol, and a few chips of porous plate. The reaction mixture is heated to gentle boiling, and the rate of heating is adjusted so that 90–100 cc. of distillate is collected per hour. The temperature of the vapor at the top of the column remains constant at 91° over a period of three to three and one-half hours while the azeotropic mixture of n-butyl alcohol and water distils. After two hours, the upper layer of n-butyl alcohol in the distillate is separated from the water, dried with a little anhydrous potassium carbonate or magnesium sulfate, and returned to the reaction mixture through the separatory funnel. Likewise, after the third hour of heating, the n-butyl alcohol in the distillate is separated, dried, and returned to the reaction flask.
A mixture of 12.95 g. (0.10 mole) of aniline hydrochloride, 6.6 g. (0.12 mole) of acrylonitrile, and 9.1 g. (0.12 mole) of diethylamine is placed in a 100-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser and heated for 2.5 hours in a bath maintained at 180°.
B. In situ lithiodibromomethane preparation/addition. An oven-dried, 2-L, round-bottomed flask with three vertical necks, containing 20.0 g (0.100 mol) of ethyl 1-naphthoate, is equipped with a 2-1/2 × ¾-inch, egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a −100°C to +50°C thermometer and a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using a nitrogen bubbler system that allows pressure release. The flask is charged through the septum (via syringe) with 200 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 15.5 mL (38.3 g, 0.220 mol) of dibromomethane. The thermometer (in a side neck) is adjusted so that the bulb is submerged when the liquid is stirred. The flask is immersed almost to the necks in a dry ice-acetone bath using about 2 L of acetone, and the contents are stirred vigorously for good heat transfer.
B. Cyclohexylidenecyclohexane. In a Hanovia 450-watt immersion photochemical reactor, equipped with a side arm attachment to monitor gas evolution, is placed 15 g. (0.068 mole) of dispiro[5.1.5.1]tetradecane-7,14-dione dissolved in 150 ml. of methylene chloride. The sample is irradiated, and carbon monoxide starts to evolve rapidly after a few minutes. Irradiation is continued until gas evolution has ceased, usually about 8–10 hours. After the irradiation most of the solvent is removed on a steam bath. The residual oil is transferred to a sublimator. The sublimator, with the cold finger removed, is placed in a vacuum desiccator, and the system is evacuated to remove any remaining methylene chloride. The semisolid residue is then sublimed at 45° (1 mm.) to yield 7 g. (63%) of crude cyclohexylidenecyclohexane. The product after recrystallization from methanol weighs 5.5 g. (49%), m.p. 53–54°.
The combined dark-brown filtrates are washed with two 300-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid saturated with sodium chloride, with one 300-ml. portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and with one 300-ml. portion of saturated salt solution, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The benzene is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, and then all material boiling at 70–97°/56 mm. is collected. Fractionation of this material through a 20-cm. heated column packed with steel saddles gives, after a fore-run of benzene, 100–109 g. (45–49% yield from 2-methylcyclohexanone) of colorless 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone, b.p. 98–101°/77 mm., nD25 1.4830–1.4835, d425 0.972, λmaxalc 234 mμ (ε 9660).
C. 5,6-Dimethoxy-2-methyl-1-indanone (3). An oven-dried 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an oval magnetic stir bar, a 500-mL addition funnel, a reflux condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adaptor connected to a bubbler and an nitrogen/vacuum manifold on the top, and a glass stopper is charged with 2 (12.0 g, 38.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) by temporary removal of the glass stopper. Freshly distilled nitromethane (390 mL) and) is added into the reaction flask via the addition funnel. When the reaction mixture begins to reflux at 100 °C, TMSOTf (0.7 mL, 0.1 equiv) is added via the addition funnel, which is rinsed with nitromethane (approximately 5 mL). After 60 min the reaction mixture is allowed to cool for 15 min before it is placed in an ice bath. After stirring for 5 min, saturated ammonium chloride solution (10 mL) is added.
The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the ether is distilled. There remains a slightly yellow oil which soon solidifies. The yield is 164–173 g. (82–87 per cent of the theoretical amount) of veratraldehyde melting at 43–44.5°. This product is sufficiently pure for many purposes, but it can be purified further with slight loss by distillation under diminished pressure. From 164 g. of the above product there is obtained 156 g. of pure veratraldehyde, boiling at 153°/8 mm. and melting at 46°. Since this aldehyde is easily oxidized in the air it should be stored in a tightly corked or sealed container.
A mixture of 870 g. (5 moles) of p-phenetidine hydrochloride and 1.2 kg. (20 moles) of urea is placed in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask. To this mixture are added 2 l. of water, 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 40 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and the well-shaken suspension is heated to boiling. The dark purple solution thus obtained is boiled vigorously for 45–90 minutes until the reaction is complete. The liquid remains clear during the first half of the heating period. Separation of the product begins during the last half and proceeds with increasing rapidity until the entire contents of the vessel suddenly set to a solid mass. The source of heat is immediately withdrawn at this point.
A solution of 123 g. (67 cc., 1.2 moles) of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 370 cc. of water is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser. To this is added 98.5 g. (0.81 mole) of diallylcyanamide (p. 203) and a few pieces of clay plate to prevent bumping. The mixture is refluxed gently for six hours. During the first fifteen minutes of heating, some bumping occurs. However, the mixture gradually becomes homogeneous and the boiling then proceeds smoothly.
The distillate is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts are washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 150 ml. of 10% sodium bicarbonate solution. The phenol is then extracted from the ether layer by use of one 200-ml. and two 50-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution. The combined alkaline solutions are acidified, with cooling, by the addition of 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The phenol is extracted with one 200-ml. and two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts are washed with 100 ml. of water and dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The mixture is filtered, and the ether is removed from the filtrate by distillation on a water bath. The residue, 65–72 g. of a brown oil, is then distilled from a Claisen flask with modified side arm; b.p. 102–104°/20 mm. The yield is 60–69 g. (80–92%).
The crude product is chromatographed on 350 g of silica using 1 : 1 ether-petroleum ether (40–60) as eluant. The chromatography is monitored by TLC and the appropriate fractions are combined. Removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator gives a pale-orange oil, which was further purified by distillation to give 11.7 g (68%) of the O-ester, bp 69–72°C (0.2 mm).
A 1500-cc. flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a 200-cc. separatory funnel. In the flask are placed 372 g. (4 moles) of aniline, 105 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium bicarbonate, and 100 cc. of water. The flask and contents are then heated on a steam bath to 90–95°, and 127 g. (115 cc., 1 mole) of benzyl chloride is run in slowly from the separatory funnel, vigorous agitation being maintained. The addition of benzyl chloride should take not less than one and one-half to two hours, and the reaction is complete in four hours.
B. Cyclobutanecarboxylic acid. The above dibasic acid is placed in a 75-ml. distilling flask carrying a thermometer and attached to a 75-ml. Claisen flask as a receiver. The receiver is cooled with running water while the flask containing the dibasic acid is heated in a metal or oil bath (bath temperature, 160–170°) until no more carbon dioxide is evolved. Then the temperature of the bath is raised to 210–220°, and the material that boils at 189–195° is collected. The crude cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (19–22 g.) is redistilled from the Claisen flask in which it was collected. The pure acid boils at 191.5–193.5°/740 mm. and weighs 18–21 g. (18–21% based on malonic ester). There is a small higher-boiling fraction, which comes over at 193.5–196°/740 mm.
B. Diethyl (R)-(−)-[1-((N-(R)-(1-phenyl-2-methoxyethyl)amino)-3-methylbutyl)]phosphonate (4) . To an oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar are added isovaleraldehyde (3) (9.4 g, 109 mmol) and dry toluene (100 mL) under an argon atmosphere. The solution is cooled to 0°C (ice bath) and a solution of (R)-(−)-1-amino-1-phenyl-2-methoxyethane (2) (16.5 g, 109 mmol) in dry toluene (160 mL) is introduced dropwise over 45 min via a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The cooling bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The resultant turbid solution is treated with anhydrous sodium sulfate (125 g, 0.88 mol), stirred for 1 hr, and then filtered through a fritted glass funnel, washing the residue with toluene (150 mL). The filtrate is concentrated, first by rotary evaporation and then at ≤1 mm for 1 hr, yielding 23.3 g of the imine as a slightly yellow oil.
B. p-Hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid. Crude 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin (8.5 g., 0.042 mole) and a few chips of porous plate are placed in a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a gas-inlet tube. A slow stream of oxygen-free nitrogen is introduced. As soon as the air has been swept out of the apparatus, 240 ml. of 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution (w/v) is added through the dropping funnel. The mixture is boiled for 3 hours in an oil bath at 170–180°. The 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin dissolves rapidly, and a clear orange solution is obtained that becomes less deeply colored during the reaction. The reaction mixture is cooled by replacing the oil bath by a bath of cold water. Without interrupting the stream of nitrogen, 100 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid is added through the dropping funnel at such a rate that foaming and heating of the mixture are not excessive. The flask is disconnected, and 5 g. of sodium bicarbonate is dissolved in the mixture.
A. trans-9,10-Dihydro-9,10-phenanthrenediol (1). Phenanthrenequinone (6 g., 0.03 mole) is placed in a fritted-glass (coarse porosity) extraction thimble of a Soxhlet apparatus over a 1-l. flask containing a suspension of 3 g. of lithium aluminum hydride in 500 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. Extraction of the quinone over a period of 16 hours affords a green solution. The reaction is quenched by the cautious addition of water and neutralized with glacial acetic acid. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed consecutively with aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and water, then dried over magnesium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gives the crude product, which is recrystallized from benzene, giving 3.8–4.1 g. (62–68%) of pure diol 1 as fluffy, white needles, m.p. 185–190°,.
A solution is then prepared from 8.1 g. (0.05 mole) of 2,6-dichloroaniline and 80 ml. of methylene chloride. This solution is added dropwise over a 30-minute period to the previously prepared peroxytrifluoroacetic acid reagent. During this addition the exothermic reaction causes the mixture to reflux. After addition is complete, the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. It is then cooled and poured into 150 ml. of cold water. The organic layer is separated, washed with 100 ml. of water, with two 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution, and finally with 50 ml. of water. The organic extract is treated with activated charcoal and anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After standing overnight, the volatile solvent is removed at aspirator pressure with the aid of a warm water bath. There is obtained 8.6–8.8 g. (89–92%) of yellow 2,6-dichloronitrobenzene, m.p. 63–68°. The product is recrystallized from a minimum volume (12–15 ml.) of ethanol and washed on the filter with 10 ml. of cold ethanol to give 5.7–7.0 g. (59–73%) of a slightly off-white product, m.p. 69–70° (reported,2 70.5°).
C. 2-Ethyl-3-Quinolinecarboxylic Acid Hydrochloride. The above solution is made acidic, (pH of 1 as determined by pH paper) through the addition of 50 mL of 12 N hydrochloric acid which results in a dense, yellow slurry which is gently stirred for 5 min. The susupension is chilled to 0 °C in an ice bath (internal temperature). A fritted glass funnel (60 mm) is fitted with filter paper, and the slurry is filtered with suction. The filter cake is washed with chilled (0 °C) HPLC grade ether (2 × 20 mL). The solids are transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and placed on a vacuum line (22 °C, 0.2 mmHg) for 24 h to remove traces of water. The title compound is isolated as a light yellow solid 11.2-11.4 g (71-72%).
A solution of sodium methoxide is prepared by dissolving 6.3 g. (0.27 atom) of sodium in 150 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol in a 1-l. flask provided with a reflux condenser. To this is added a solution of 50 g. (0.23 mole) of 1,3,5-trinitrobenzene (p. 541) in 550 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol. The mixture is boiled for about twenty minutes. The reflux condenser is then replaced by a still head and condenser, and about 300–350 cc. of alcohol is distilled. The residue in the flask is cooled to 20° and filtered.
B. Cyclization. The above oil is poured dropwise into a well-stirred mixture of 110 ml. of 90% phosphoric acid (sp. gr. 1.75) and 23.4 ml. of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.83) which is kept at −10°. The temperature is allowed to rise to 0–10°, and the stirring is continued for 2 hours. The viscous reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml. of ice and water, and the acid is partially neutralized with 300 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide solution with efficient cooling. The viscous cream-colored oil is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of ether; the ether extract is washed well with water and sodium bicarbonate solution to remove the last traces of acid and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The cyclized ester, after removal of the ether, is a red oil which solidifies upon cooling. The yield is 23–24 g.
The yield of pure white mandelic acid melting at 118° is 229–235 g. (50–52 per cent of the theoretical amount based on benzaldehyde).
D. Benzoylcholine chloride. Silver chloride is prepared by dissolving 160 g. (0.94 mole) of silver nitrate in 500 ml. of boiling distilled water and adding 120 ml. of analytical reagent hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) from a dropping funnel in a period of 15 minutes, with continuous stirring. The silver chloride is washed by decantation with three 300-ml. portions of boiling distilled water. The moist silver chloride is suspended in 750 ml. of water warmed to 50–60° in a 2-l. beaker, and 210 g. (0.63 mole) of benzoylcholine iodide is added in a period of 1 hour, with good mechanical stirring. After the addition is completed, stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes without the application of heat. The mixture is cooled and filtered with suction. The silver salts on the filter are washed with 200 ml. of hot water, and the combined filtrates are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (water pump). The residue is dried by twice distilling to dryness with 250 ml. of absolute ethanol and then once with 250 ml. of dry acetone, the last of the acetone being removed under reduced pressure. The product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 240 ml. of isopropyl alcohol and allowing the solution to cool in a refrigerator. It is filtered and dried, first at 100° and then in a vacuum desiccator over silica gel. The yield of pure product, m.p. 207° (dec.), is 125–132 g. (82–87%).
A. 2-Nitro-6-methoxybenzonitrile. Five hundred grams (2.97 moles) of technical m-dinitrobenzene (m.p. 88–89°) is dissolved in 7.5 l. of absolute methanol in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The temperature is raised to 40° by means of a water bath and maintained there while a solution of 230 g. of potassium cyanide in 400 ml. of water is added with stirring. The dark purple mixture is stirred for 2 hours and then is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2–3 days. The black precipitate is collected with suction on a Büchner funnel, pressed as dry as possible, and then spread out in the air to dry. It weighs about 185–188 g.
The amine is recrystallized by dissolving it in 250 ml. of 95% ethanol, boiling a few minutes with 5 g. of Norit, and filtering. The clear filtrate is either concentrated to a small volume or is diluted by the addition of 200–250 ml. of water and allowed to stand overnight in the icebox. The crystalline amine (m.p. 176°) is then filtered and air-dried. The yield is 55–57 g. (74–77%).
(A) Preparation of Thiocarbonyl Perchloride.—In a 5-l. bottle arranged for cooling by running water is placed 500 g. (398 cc., 6.58 moles) of dry carbon disulfide to which 0.5 g. of iodine has been added. Dry chlorine is passed into the cooled carbon disulfide at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 25°, until the liquid weighs 1770 g. (17.9 moles of chlorine). The time required is about forty hours. The product, a mixture of impure thiocarbonyl perchloride and sulfur chloride, is a deep red liquid.
C. (4R,5S)-4,5-Diphenyl-3-vinyl-2-oxazolidinone . A 500-mL filter flask is charged with (4R,5S)-3-(1-methoxyethyl)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolidinone (8.9 g, 30 mmol) and solid ammonium chloride, NH4Cl (0.32 g, 6.0 mmol). The flask is stoppered and heated behind a blast shield in a sand bath to 150°C - 170°C under reduced pressure via a water aspirator (ca. 11 mm) for 3 hr. The crude material is dissolved in CH2Cl2 and run through silica gel with CH2Cl2 ( 40 g of SiO2 , 250 mL of CH2Cl2 ) to afford the product as a white solid (6.68 g, 84.2%). (A second treatment with silica is sometimes required to give completely clean product.)
The solution is cooled to −78°C in a dry ice–acetone bath, and 38.19 g (0.23 mol) of tetrafluoroboric acid–diethyl ether complex is added dropwise by syringe over a 30-min period. The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. The yellow precipitate is filtered off and collected in a 250-mL Schlenk tube, washed with ether, and dried under a stream of nitrogen and finally under reduced pressure (oil pump). The bright-yellow salt 1 weighs 43.2–57.6 g (60–80%) and may be used without further purification. It may be stored indefinitely under nitrogen at 0°C without decomposition.
B. Adamantane. In a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask having a 24/40 standard taper joint are placed 200 g. (1.47 moles) of molten endo-tetrahydrodicyclopentadiene and a magnetic stirring bar. A well-greased inner joint (2.2 × 15 cm., 24/40) is fitted into the top of the flask to serve as an air condenser, and 40 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride is added through the opening. The reaction mixture is simultaneously stirred and heated at 150–180°, by means of a combination magnetic stirrer-hot plate. Aluminum chloride sublimes to the top of the flask, especially at the beginning of the reaction, and the accumulated sublimate is, from time to time, pushed down into the reaction liquid. After the mixture has been heated for 8–12 hours, the flask is removed from the hot plate-stirrer and the black contents upon cooling separate into two layers. The upper layer, a brown mush of adamantane and other products, is decanted carefully from the lower black tarry layer into a 600-ml. beaker. The Erlenmeyer flask is rinsed five times with a total of 250 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°) with decantation into the same beaker,. The petroleum ether suspension is warmed until all the adamantane is in solution; there should be an appreciable excess of solvent. The solution is decolorized by careful addition of 10 g. of chromatography-grade alumina, the hot solution filtered, and the alumina and the beaker washed thoroughly with solvent. The nearly colorless filtrate is concentrated to a volume of about 200 ml. by distillation and then cooled in a Dry Ice-acetone bath. The solid adamantane is removed by suction filtration and there results 27–30 g. (13.5–15.0%) of crystals, melting point about 255–260°,. One recrystallization from petroleum ether raises the melting point to 268–270°,.
D. 4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazoline-3,5-dione. A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a gas-inlet tube, a calcium chloride-containing drying tube, and a magnetic stirrer is flushed with oxygen-free nitrogen and charged with 12 ml. of ethyl acetate and 4.4 g. (0.025 mole) of 4-phenylurazole. The stirrer is started, and 2.5 g. (2.8 ml., 0.023 mole) of tert-butyl hypochlorite and is added to the flask over a period of approximately 20 minutes, the reaction mixture being maintained close to room temperature with a cold-water bath and. After the addition is complete, the resulting suspension is stirred for 40 minutes at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 100-ml., round-bottomed flask, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, keeping the temperature below 40°. The last traces of solvent are removed with a high-vacuum pump (about 0.1 mm.). The product is sublimed onto an ice-cooled cold finger under vacuum (100° at 0.1 mm.), yielding 2.7–2.8 g. (62–64%) of the triazoline as carmine-red crystals which decompose (165–175°) before melting; IR cm.−1 1760 and 1780; UV (dioxane) nm (ε) 247 (2300), 310 (1020), and 532 (171) and.
B. Dicarbonyl(cyclopentadientyl)(trans-3-methyl-2-vinylcyclohexanone)iron tetrafluoroborate (3). Under a nitrogen atmosphere, cuprous iodide (24.76 g, 0.13 mol) and 150 mL of ether are placed in a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar, and cooled to 0°C in an ice–salt bath. First 172 mL (0.26 mol) of methyllithium in ether is added by syringe, then 12.60 g (0.13 mol) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one is added dropwise by syringe while the mixture is stirred at 0°C. A bright yellow precipitate forms immediately. After 15 min, 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added and the mixture is cooled to −78°C in a dry ice–acetone bath. While vigorous stirring and a strong flow of nitrogen are maintained, one septum is removed and 43.70 g (0.13 mol) of complex salt 1 is added at once. The septum is replaced and 50 mL of fresh tetrahydrofuran is used to wash solid 1 from the neck and sides of the reaction vessel. After 1 hr at −78°C, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature while stirring is continued. Stirring is halted to allow insoluble copper salts to settle, leaving a red supernatant liquid. A 250-mL, coarse-frit, Schlenk filter is prepared with a Celite mat, topped with 2 in. of activity-IV neutral alumina, which is further deactivated by washing in the Schlenk tube with 100 mL of diethyl ether. The supernatant solution is transferred to the Schlenk tube by cannula and filtered by suction into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar. The copper salts remaining in the reaction vessel are repeatedly washed with fresh ether until the filtered washings are nearly colorless. Removal of solvent from the filtrate leaves product 2 as a deep red oil.
The solution is now cooled to 20° by the addition of about 1 kg. of ice and 500 cc. of technical concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.16) is added with stirring. This precipitates the aminonaphthol as a voluminous, almost white precipitate which is collected on two 20-cm. Büchner funnels. It is rapidly pressed as free from mother liquor as possible and transferred quickly to an 8-l. (2-gal.) crock containing 2.5 l. of water and 250 cc. of technical concentrated hydrochloric acid. The large lumps are broken up with a rod, steam is passed in, and the stirrer is started. Steam is introduced at such a rate that a temperature of 85–90° is reached within ten minutes; the mixture is stirred at this temperature for one hour longer. The hot mixture is then filtered through a 15-cm. Büchner funnel, and the filtrate is cooled to 35–40° in an ice bath.
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer and a constant water separator surmounted by a reflux condenser are placed 120 g. (1 mole) of acetophenone, 113 g. (1 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate, 15.4 g. (0.2 mole) of ammonium acetate, 48.0 g. (0.8 mole) of glacial acetic acid, and 200 ml. of benzene. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 9 hours during which time 28–33 ml. of lower layer is collected in the water separator. To the cooled reaction mixture is added 100 ml. of benzene, and the whole is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of water. The combined aqueous layers are extracted with 30 ml. of benzene, which is then added to the organic layer from the previous extraction. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (15 g.) is added, and, after swirling occasionally for 10 minutes, the mixture is filtered by suction and the magnesium sulfate washed with two 25-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene is removed by distillation at reduced pressure and the residual oil distilled rapidly through a 15-cm. column. The yield of ester is 113–125 g. (52–58%), b.p. 135–160° (0.35 mm.).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer and a 1-l. separatory funnel, is placed 2800 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, and to this is added 125 g. (5.4 atoms) of sodium over a period of one to two hours. The stirrer is started and the mixture allowed to cool to room temperature, and a mixture of 730 g. (673 cc., 5 moles) of ethyl oxalate and 290 g. (366 cc., 5 moles) of acetone is added slowly over a period of two to three hours. At first a white precipitate forms; this is followed by a yellow precipitate that darkens as the reaction proceeds and later turns yellow again. The temperature rises to about 40°. Toward the end the mixture becomes so thick that stirring is difficult. Stirring is continued for one hour after the addition of the oxalate and acetone mixture. The yellow sodium salt is filtered by suction on two 20-cm. Büchner funnels. The reaction flask is rinsed with 200 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, which is then used to wash the salt. The filtrate is turbid as a rule, but there is not enough sodium salt in suspension or solution to warrant recovery.
A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser is charged with 5 g. (0.013 mole) of tricarbonyl[(1,2,3,4,5-η)-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-yl]iron(1+) hexafluorophosphate(1−), 150 ml. of water, and 50 ml. of ethanol and heated on the steam bath with occasional swirling until the salt is dissolved. Dimedone (1,3-Cyclohexanedione, 5,5-dimethyl-) (2.5 g., 0.018 mole) is dissolved in 50 ml. of ethanol by warming. The two solutions are mixed and refluxed for 15 minutes. After cooling to about 25°, the mixture is poured into 500 ml. of water with stirring, and the precipitate is collected, washed with water, and air-dried, yielding 4.4 g. of crude product. The product is recrystallized by first dissolving in a minimum volume of boiling ethanol and adding water until the first sign of turbidity. On standing under refrigeration overnight, crystallization occurs. After collection by filtration, the product is washed with water and air-dried, yielding 3.7 g. of small, white to buff-colored crystals, which darken above 140° but do not melt. On addition of water to the filtrate a crop of 0.6 g. is obtained, giving a total yield of 4.3 g. (87%).
The crude mixture is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a calcium chloride drying tube. To the flask is added 450 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the mixture is cooled to −78°C in a dry ice–acetone bath. The drying tube is removed for a brief period, and 28.5 g (0.25 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide is quickly added in one portion using a powder funnel. The reaction is stirred for 1 hr at −78°C, warmed to 0°C, stirred for 3 hr, and then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr. At the end of this time 60 mL of water is added slowly to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 25°C to a volume of ca. 150 mL. The mixture is taken up in 160 mL of ether and washed successively with six 60-mL portions of water and one 60-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ether layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The resulting dark-brown oil is chromatographed through a 4-cm × 41-cm column of silica gel with eluting with hexane. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure at 25°C affords 10.5–11.5 g (80–88%) of 1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropene as a pale yellow oil.
The catalyst is allowed to cool under nitrogen, and 400 ml. of bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether is added from the dropping funnel. The stopper is then temporarily removed to add 20.6 g. (0.0497 mole) of bis(4-methoxyphenyl)tellurium dichloride. The mixture is refluxed for 8 hours and filtered while still hot. The filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure (10–20 mm.), giving a residue which when recrystallized from ethanol yields 8.5–9.8 g. (78–90%) of the product, m.p. 175–176°.
B. Iodocyclohexane. A 500-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 124 g. (107 ml., 0.400 mole) of triphenyl phosphite and 85 g. (37 ml., 0.60 mole) of methyl iodide. A thermometer of sufficient length extends into the liquid contents of the flask. The mixture is heated under gentle reflux with a heating mantle until the internal temperature has risen to about 120°. At this point the mixture is dark and viscous. The flask is cooled, and 40 g. (0.40 mole) of cyclohexanol is added to the oily methyltriphenoxyphosphonium iodide. The mixture is shaken gently until homogeneous and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The mixture is distilled through a 13-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 62.5–63 g. (74–75%) of iodocyclohexane, b.p. 66–68° (12 mm.), nD22 1.5475.
Derivatization and enantiomeric excess determination of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane: A 13 × 100-mm test tube is charged with 25 mg of the diammonium tartrate salt , 1.5 mL of methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), and 0.5 mL of 4 N aqueous sodium hydroxide . The two phases are mixed thoroughly for 30 sec using a vortex mixer, then m-toluoyl chloride (50 μL) is added and the two phases are mixed for an additional 30 sec. The phases are allowed to separate and a 250-μL sample of the lower organic layer is removed. The sample is diluted to 10 mL with isopropyl alcohol and the resultant solution (10 μL) is analyzed by HPLC. The enantiomers are separated using a Pirkle covalent L-Leucine-DNB column and eluting with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (90:10; v/v) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and at ambient temperature. The enantiomers are detected by measuring the absorbance of the eluent at 254 nm.
In a dry, 1-l., two-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube, are placed 17.8 g. (0.100 mole) of anthracene, 27.2 g. (0.202 mole) of anhydrous cupric chloride, and 500 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 18–24 hours. The brown cupric chloride is gradually converted to white cuprous chloride, and hydrogen chloride is gradually evolved. At the end of the reaction the cuprous chloride is removed by filtration, and the carbon tetrachloride solution is passed through a 35-mm. Chromatographic column filled with 200 g. of alumina. The column is eluted with 400 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined eluates are evaporated to dryness to give 19–21 g. (89–99%) of 9-chloroanthracene as a lemon-yellow solid, m.p. 102–104°. Crystallization of the product from petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°) gives 16–17 g. (75–80%) of 9-chloroanthracene as yellow needles, m.p. 104–106°.
The methylene chloride phase is washed with two 150-mL portions of saturated sodium disulfite solution and dried over magnesium sulfate and sodium sulfate. After a negative peroxide test, the solvent is removed. The crude product (255 g) is fractionated through a 30-cm Vigreux column. The material boiling at 85–85°C (13 mm) is collected to give 210 g of butenolide, which is yellow because of some high-boiling residues. Redistillation through the 30-cm Vigreux column and collection of the material boiling at 100–102°C (30 mm), 95–97°C (19 mm), 89–91°C (16 mm), or 79–81°C (9 mm) gives colorless butenolide. In this way 170.2 g (41%) of pure butenolide is obtained.
A. (S)-2-Amido-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (2). An oven-dried, three-necked, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with an argon inlet, septum, thermocouple and a stirring bar is charged with Cbz-l-proline (1) (20.0 g, 80.2 mmol), di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (22.7 g, 104 mmol, 1.3 equiv), ammonium bicarbonate (7.60 g, 96.2 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and acetonitrile (400 mL) under an argon atmosphere. After all reagents are combined, a cloudy, white mixture forms. Pyridine (3.89 mL, 48.1 mmol, 0.6 equiv) is added in one portion via syringe and the mixture is stirred for 5 h at room temperature. After complete consumption of the starting material (as monitored by thin layer chromatography, Notes 8 and 9), the reaction mixture is transferred to a one-necked, 1-L, round-bottomed flask and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (25 °C, 15 mmHg) until approximately 100 mL remains. Ethyl acetate (200 mL) and water (200 mL) are added, the mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted further with ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (200 mL), then are dried (MgSO4, 16 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (23-40 °C, 30 mmHg) to give a white solid. Recrystallization of the solid from ethyl acetate affords 17.98–18.95 g (90-95%) of 2 as white cubes.
(b) Lithium chloride method. A 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed Hershberg wire stirrer, a thermometer, and a tube leading to a source of nitrogen, is charged with 26 g. of lithium chloride, 250 ml. of dimethylformamide and crude 2-chloro-2-methylcyclohexanone prepared as described above (part A, half-scale) from 112 g. of 2-methylcyclohexanone. The stirrer is started, the air swept out with nitrogen, and the flask immersed in an oil bath maintained at 100°. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 100° in about 10 minutes, then to 112° and back to 105° in another 25 minutes. At the end of this time the mixture is cooled, 1-l. each of ether and of 2.5% sulfuric acid is added, and the mixture is stirred for about 4 hours to hydrolyze the dimethylformamide. The aqueous layer is separated, saturated with sodium chloride, and extracted with four 150-ml. portions of ether. These extracts are combined with the original ether layer, washed with saturated sodium chloride solution and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and finally dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, and then a fraction boiling at 79–107°/28 mm. is collected. Redistillation through a 20-cm. heated column packed with steel saddles gives 47–50 g. (43–45% yield from 2-methylcyclohexanone) of colorless 2-methyl-2-cyclohexenone, b.p. 83–85.5°/35 mm., nD25 1.4833–1.4840, λmaxalc 234 mμ (ε 9680).
A. (S)-3-(tert-Butyloxycarbonylamino)-1-diazo-4-phenylbutan-2-one . A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen gas inlet, bubble counter and a rubber septum on the center neck. The apparatus is dried under a rapid stream of nitrogen with a heat gun. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the rate of nitrogen flow is reduced and Boc-phenylalanine (25.0 g, 94.2 mmol, Note 1) and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL, Note 2) are added. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath and triethylamine (13.1 mL, 94.0 mmol, Note 3) is added. After 15 min ethyl chloroformate (9.45 mL, 94.0 mmol,Note 4) is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for another 15 min, and a white precipitate of triethylammonium chloride appears; the stirring is then stopped. The septum is replaced by a funnel Note. An ethereal solution of diazomethane (about 125 mL, Note 6) is added through the funnel, stirring is resumed for about 5 seconds and the nitrogen stream is stopped. After 45 min, the remainder of the diazomethane solution (about 85 mL) is added. The cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to react for 3 hr without stirring. With stirring, 75 mL of 0.5 N acetic acid is added carefully to destroy unreacted diazomethane and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (75 mL) is added carefully. The aqueous layer is separated in a separatory funnel and the organic layer is washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (75 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and the solvents are removed under vacuum on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is placed under high vacuum for 3 hr. The crude material is used directly in the next step.
2-Heptyl-2-cyclohexenone. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 15.2 g (0.1 mol) of o-anisic acid and 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran. An acetone–dry ice condenser and mechanical stirrer are put in place, the flask is immersed in an acetone–dry ice bath, and 400 mL of ammonia is distilled in,. The resulting thick white suspension (the ammonium salt of the acid) is stirred mechanically. Sodium, washed sequentially with xylenes and ether, is added in small pieces. The suspension dissolves to give a pale yellow solution which, upon introduction of more sodium, changes to the characteristic blue color of excess sodium. When the deep blue color persists, a mixture of 1-bromoheptane (21.49 g, 0.12 mol) and 1.0 mL (2.4 mmol) of 1,2-dibromoethane is added in one portion. The blue color is discharged immediately, leaving a yellow solution. The acetone–dry ice bath and the condenser are removed, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate under a gentle stream of nitrogen.
B. N-1-(Chloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)acetamide (2). A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a glass stopper and a condenser. The top of the condenser is fitted with a T-joint allowing argon to sweep the effluent gases (HCl and sulfur dioxide) from the reaction into the exit duct of a well ventilated fume hood. The flask is charged with compound 1 (8.98 g, 57 mmol), thionyl chloride (7.1 g, 60 mmol) and heptane (65 mL). The resulting suspension is stirred and heated to 85 °C in an oil bath under argon until a clear solution has formed. Stirring is continued for 15 min before the mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, whereupon the product starts to crystallize. After standing for 30 min, the crystals are collected by filtration, rinsed with heptane (2 × 25 mL) and dried under vacuum (25 °C, 1 mmHg) for 1 h to provide product 2 (9.3 g, 93%) as colorless crystals, which were used without further purification in the next step.
The well-stirred solution of Caro's acid is poured into the suspension of nitroaminotoluene. The mixture is stirred and warmed, but as soon as the temperature reaches 40°, heating is discontinued. After the solution has been stirred for 2 hours longer, an additional 100 g. (0.37 mole) of powdered potassium persulfate is added in one portion. The heat of reaction is sufficient to maintain the temperature at 40°. Stirring is continued for 2 hours more, and the suspension is then diluted with water to 4 l. The solid is filtered with suction and washed with 400 ml. of water. The wet material is transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, about 700 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is steam-distilled. The 2-nitroso-5-nitrotoluene is filtered from the distillate. The total yield of air-dried product is 30–39 g. (55–71%).
A. Methyl (chlorosulfonyl)carbamate. A dry, two-necked, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a 125-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with a solution of 70.8 g. (43.6 ml., 0.580 mole) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in 150 ml. of anhydrous benzene. A solution of 16.0 g. (20.2 ml., 0.500 mole) of anhydrous methanol in 25 ml. of anhydrous benzene is placed in the dropping funnel. The flask is immersed in a water bath, stirring is begun, and the methanol–benzene solution is added dropwise over 0.5 hour. Cold water is added to the bath as required to maintain a temperature of 25–30°. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 0.5 hour before 125 ml. of olefin-free hexane is added from the addition funnel over a 5-minute period while cooling the flask to 0–5° with an ice bath. The moisture-sensitive product is removed by filtration, washed twice with 40 ml. of hexane, and dried under reduced pressure, giving 76–80 g. (88–92%) of methyl (chlorosulfonyl)carbamate as white crystals, m.p. 72–74°. This material should be stored in a brown bottle protected from light.
B. (1R,4S)-(−)-Camphorquinone monoxime . A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 10.0 g (0.060 mol) of crude (1R)-(−)-camphorquinone (2), 240 mL of ethanol , 40 mL of pyridine and 5.44 g (0.078 mol) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (NH2OH·HCl). The solution is stirred for 20 min, and the ethanol is removed by rotary evaporation at 40°C. The resulting oil is diluted with 100 mL of hexane and 100 mL of ethyl acetate , and the solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic phase is separated and washed successively with 125 mL of 5% hydrochloric acid solution, 300 mL of water, and 300 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution. The organic solution is dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is taken up in 65 mL of heptane and heated to reflux. After reflux is maintained for 2 min, the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. The solid is collected by vacuum filtration, and the filter cake is dried under high vacuum to provide 8.63 g (79%) of (1R)-(−)-camphorquinone oxime (3) as an off-white solid. This is a mixture of syn- and anti-oxime isomers, mp 148-151°C [α]D 22 +184° (CH2Cl2, c 3.5).
A solution of 82.2 g. (0.2 mole) of acetobromoglucose (p. 11) in 125 ml. of dry acetone in a 250-ml. flask is cooled to 0° in an ice bath. To the cold solution is added 2.3 ml. of water and then 46.5 g. (0.17 mole) of silver carbonate in small portions in the course of 15 minutes. The mixture is shaken well during the addition and for 30 minutes longer. The mixture is then warmed to 50–60° and filtered. The mass of silver salts is washed with 65 ml. of dry acetone, removed from the funnel, warmed in a flask with 65 ml. more of acetone, filtered, and washed again on the funnel.
A mixture of 58.5 g. (0.5 mole) of acetylglycine (p. 11), 30 g. (0.37 mole) of anhydrous sodium acetate, 79 g. (0.74 mole) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde, and 134 g. (1.25 moles) of 95 per cent acetic anhydride in a loosely corked 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask is warmed on the steam bath with occasional stirring until solution is complete (ten to twenty minutes). The resulting solution is boiled for one hour under reflux, cooled, and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The solid mass of yellow crystals is treated with 125 cc. of cold water and broken up with a stirring rod. The crystals are then transferred to a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with cold water. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide and potassium hydroxide, the crude azlactone weighs 69–72 g. (74–77 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product melts at 148–150°, and is sufficiently pure for preparative purposes.
Seventy grams (1 mole) of freshly prepared potassium methoxide and 41 g. (1 mole) of freshly purified acetonitrile are placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask. A cold-finger condenser which extends into the bulb of the flask is inserted through a rubber stopper in the neck of the flask, and a short piece of rubber tubing carrying a Hofmann clamp is connected to the side arm of the flask. The tubing is connected to an aspirator, and suction is applied until the acetonitrile begins to boil, whereupon the tubing is closed by means of the clamp and the flask is heated for 5 hours in an oil bath maintained at 140°.
A 1-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser bearing a nitrogen inlet, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer is charged with 5.40 g. (0.222 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings. The flask is flame dried while being flushed with nitrogen and kept dry and oxygen-free with a static nitrogen atmosphere throughout the preparation. After 150 ml. of diethyl ether is introduced into the flask with a syringe, 54.9 g. (28.2 ml., 0.222 mole) of bromopentafluorobenzene is added dropwise over ca. 45 minutes at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux. The reflux is maintained for another 15 minutes by heating at 35°. The resulting black solution is cooled to room temperature, and 63.1 g. (0.440 mole) of powdered, anhydrous copper(I) bromide is added in three 21-g. portions at 1-minute intervals. An exothermic reaction occurs after each addition.
C. 1,4,8,11-Tetrathiacyclotetradecane. A dry, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a double-necked adapter for a thermometer and the 250-mL addition funnel shown in Figure 1, a reflux condenser, and a mechanical stirrer with a 7-cm blade of Teflon. The entire system is kept under positive nitrogen pressure. The flask is charged with 2.2 L of N,N-dimethylformamide and 13.04 g (40 mmol) of cesium carbonate. The mixture is stirred and heated to 55–60°C.
D. Δ5-Cholesten-3-one. The moist 5α,6β-dibromocholestan-3-one from 150 g. of cholesterol is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and covered with 2 l. of U.S.P. ether and 25 ml. of acetic acid. The suspension is stirred mechanically, and ice bath is raised into position, and the temperature is brought to 15°. The ice bath is then lowered, and 5 g. of fresh zinc dust is added. As soon as the exothermic reaction of debromination sets in, the temperature is controlled to 15–20° by cooling during the addition (in about 5 minutes) of 35 g. more zinc dust. The ice bath is then lowered, and the ethereal solution containing suspended zinc dust is stirred for 10 minutes longer. With continued stirring, 40 ml. of pyridine is added; this precipitates a white zinc salt. The mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel, and the filter cake is washed well with ether. The colorless filtrate is washed with three 600-ml. portions of water and then shaken thoroughly with 600 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution until free from acetic acid as indicated by testing the ethereal solution with moist blue litmus paper. The solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to a volume of about 1 l.; 500 ml. of methanol is added, and the evaporation is continued until the volume is approximately 1.2 l. Crystallization is allowed to proceed at room temperature, then at 0–4°, and the large colorless prisms are collected by suction filtration; yield in the first crop 87–94 g., melting point in the range 124–129° (camphorlike odor), [α]D25 −2.5° chloroform (c = 2.03), no selective absorption at 242 mμ. Concentration of the mother liquor gives a second crop of 12–19 g. melting in the range 117–125° and suitable for conversion to Δ4-cholesten-3-one; total yield 106–108 g. (71–72% from cholesterol).
A. Dimethyl 3-chloro-2-pentenedioate. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a ground-glass stopper, a condenser provided with a gas bubbler, a gas-inlet adapter attached to a nitrogen (or argon) source, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 60.0 g. (0.297 mole) of diethyl acetone-1,3-dicarboxylate. A steady, gentle flow of nitrogen is started through the reaction vessel, and 65.0 g. (0.313 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride is added in thirteen, approximately equal portions through the stoppered joint to the neat diester at 3-minute intervals with vigorous stirring. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is warmed to 40° in a water bath for 30 minutes. The red solution is cooled in an ice bath and poured onto ca. 100 ml. of ice in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath. A 1 : 1 mixture of water and dichloromethane is used to rinse traces of the product from the reaction vessel into the Erlenmeyer flask, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. After separating the two layers, the aqueous phase is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane, and the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration through glass wool and removal of solvents with a rotary evaporator affords ca. 60 g. of a red oil, which is placed in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask containing 20 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 ml. of anhydrous methanol, and the solution is refluxed using a heating mantle for 18 hours. Excess methanol (200 ml.) is distilled, and the residual yellow solution is cooled to room temperature and poured into 100 ml. of water. Sodium chloride is added to saturation, and the solution is extracted with eight 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined extracts are washed successively with 150 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and 150 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Concentration of the extract with a rotary evaporator affords a yellow oil which is distilled, yielding 33.5–34.4 g. (59–60%) of dimethyl 3-chloro-2-pentenedioate2 as a colorless liquid, b.p. 50–60° (0.02 mm.).
A. Lithium phenylthio(tert-butyl)cuprate. A dry, 200-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, the top of which is connected to a nitrogen inlet. After the apparatus has been flushed with nitrogen, 50 ml. of 1.60 M (0.080 mole) n-butyllithium solution is placed in the flask and cooled with an ice bath. Under a nitrogen atmosphere, a solution of 8.81 g. (0.0801 mole) of freshly distilled thiophenol in 30 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise to the cooled, stirred solution. An aliquot of the resulting solution is standardized by quenching in water, followed by titration with 0.10 N hydrochloric acid to a green end point with a bromocresol indicator. The concentration of lithium thiophenoxide prepared in this manner is typically 1.0 M.
C. 4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-2-[2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl]-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole ((S)-tert-ButylPHOX). A 150-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a glass valve, a glass stopper, and a 1.7 cm × 0.7 cm, egg-shaped, teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is dried with a heat gun under vacuum and cooled under argon atmosphere. The glass stopper is removed under a positive pressure of argon and the flask is charged with copper(I) iodide (19.0 mg, 0.10 mmol, 0.005 equiv), diphenylphosphine (4.35 mL, 25.0 mmol, 1.25 equiv), N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (53 μL, 0.50 mmol, 0.025 equiv) and toluene (20 mL). The flask is sealed with the glass stopper and the colorless contents are stirred at ambient temperature for 20 min. The glass stopper is then removed under a positive pressure of argon and the flask is charged with 2-(2-bromophenyl)-4-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-4,5-dihydro-(4S)-oxazole (5.64 g, 20.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv), cesium carbonate (9.78 g, 30.0 mmol, 1.50 equiv), and toluene (20 mL, 0.50 M total) to wash the neck and walls of the flask. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold. The now yellow heterogeneous reaction is placed in a 110 °C oil bath and vigorously stirred under argon atmosphere. Following consumption of starting material, the reaction is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, filtered through a pad of celite, and the filter cake is washed with dichloromethane (2 × 40 mL). The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 °C, 15 mmHg) to a pale yellow semi-solid. The residue is dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane (ca. 40 mL), dry-loaded onto silica gel (10 g), and purified by silica gel chromatography eluting with 24:1 hexanes/diethyl ether until excess Ph2PH elutes, then with a 9:1 dichloromethane/diethyl ether mixture until the desired product elutes. The combined fractions are concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (40 °C, 14 mmHg) to a viscous, pale yellow oil and layered with acetonitrile (ca. 5 mL) to facilitate crystallization. The flask is swirled while crystals form within seconds. After approximately 15 minutes, the flask is placed under high vacuum to remove volatiles to afford 6.81 g (17.6 mmol, 88% yield) of (S)-tert-ButylPHOX as white blocks.
The mother liquor from the recrystallization is placed in a 250-ml. flask and is concentrated to a volume of 8–10 ml. under reduced pressure at not over 30–40°. The concentrate, when cooled overnight at 0°, deposits a solid which is filtered, recrystallized from its own weight of boiling water, and dried over sulfuric acid. This solid weighs about 2 g. The mother liquors from the two crystallizations are combined with the original mother liquor from the oxidation, and the whole is evaporated to dryness under diminished pressure at not above 30–40°. This solid residue is somewhat yellow and possesses a strong odor of nitric acid. It is kept on a tray for several days until the odor of nitric acid disappears, and then it is dissolved in its own weight (2–3 g.) of boiling water, and the solution is cooled for several days below 0°. The solid is removed, recrystallized from water, and dried over sulfuric acid. This crop weighs about 0.5 g. The total yield of alloxan monohydrate is 18–19 g. (72–76%).
This salt mixture is dissolved in 270 cc. of water, and the acid potassium salt is precipitated by adding 8 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 30 cc. of water. After standing for three hours, or overnight, the mixture is filtered with suction. The acid salt is then dissolved in 240 cc. of water to which 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid has been added, and the solution is extracted with five 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are evaporated to dryness on a steam bath, leaving pure hydrated crystals of acetylenedicarboxylic acid. After drying for two days over concentrated sulfuric acid in a vacuum desiccator the crystals decompose sharply at 175–176°. The yield is 30–36 g. (73–88 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Oxodiperoxymolybdenum(pyridine)(hexamethylphosphoric triamide) MoO5·Py·HMPA=MoOPH.2 The recrystallized product from above is dried over phosphorus oxide (P2O5) in a vacuum desiccator, shielded from the light, for 24 hr at 0.2 mm to give a somewhat hygroscopic yellow solid, MoO5·HMPA. A 36.0-g (0.101 mol) portion of MoO5·HMPA is dissolved in 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the solution is filtered through a Celite mat, if needed, to remove a small amount of amorphous precipitate. The filtrate is then stirred magnetically in a 20°C water bath while 8.0 g (0.101 mol) of dry pyridine is added over 10 min. The crystalline, yellow product is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with dry tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) and anhydrous ether (200 mL) and dried in a vacuum desiccator (1 hr, 0.2 mm) to yield 36–38 g (51–53% overall from MoO3) of finely divided yellow crystalline MoO5·Py·HMPA.
A. α-Bromo-α-phenylacetone. A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a water-cooled reflux condenser provided with a short inverted U-tube on the open end; the equipment is assembled in the hood. In the flask are placed 200 ml. of dry, thiophene-free benzene and 37 g. (36.89 ml., 0.276 mole) of phenylacetone. The stirrer is started, and 45 g. (14.42 ml., 0.28 mole) of reagent bromine is added dropwise during a period of 1 hour. The reaction mixture first becomes cloudy but changes to a clear orange-red solution by the time all the bromine is added. After the addition of bromine is complete, a rapid stream of dry nitrogen or carbon dioxide is passed through the solution by means of an inlet tube which now replaces the dropping funnel. The hydrogen bromide issuing from the inverted U-tube at the top of the condenser may be trapped in water in an Erlenmeyer flask or other container adjusted so that the water surface is about 1 cm. below the outlet of the tube. The reaction is complete when no more hydrogen bromide fumes can be detected in the gas issuing from the condenser. This operation requires 3–6 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes yellow to green. The benzene solution of α-bromo-α-phenylacetone is then transferred to a dry 500-ml. separatory funnel.
A. 2,2-Dichloronorbornane. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a calcium sulfate drying tube is charged with 91.3 g. (0.665 mole) of phosphorus trichloride and 90.0 g. (0.817 mole) of norcamphor. The solution is stirred and cooled to 0° in an ice–salt bath, then 193 g. (0.927 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride is added in portions over a 1-hour period. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stand overnight. The contents of the flask are poured carefully onto 1000 g. of crushed ice. The mixture is thoroughly dispersed and extracted with four 500-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane layers are washed with two 600-ml. portions of water, and the aqueous layers are extracted with one 500-ml. portion of pentane. The pentane extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residual brown liquid affords 111–114 g. (82–85%) of 2,2-dichloronorbornane as a clear liquid, b.p. 70–74° (14 mm.), which solidifies on standing.
After standing overnight the syrupy liquid is poured slowly with stirring into 3 kg. of ice in a 3-gal. crock. The solution is then neutralized by adding barium carbonate in 100-g. portions, stirring occasionally until the gas evolution slackens before each addition: 2.4–2.5 kg. is required. The pasty mass is filtered by suction on a 30-cm. Büchner funnel, and the barium sulfate is washed with five 300-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrates are evaporated nearly to dryness on a steam bath and finally dried in an oven at 125–140°. The yield of crude barium salt is 640–800 g.
B. 3-(1,1-Dimethylethyl) 4-methyl-(S)-2,2-dimethyloxazolidine-3,4-dicarboxylate (3) . To a solution of N-Boc-L-serine methyl ester (10.0 g, 45.6 mmol) in acetone (165 mL) is added 2,2-dimethoxypropane (50 mL, 400 mmol) and boron trifluoride etherate (BF3·OEt2, 0.35 mL, 2.8 mmol) and. The resulting orange solution is stirred at room temperature for 2.5 hr when TLC analysis indicates the reaction to be complete. The reaction mixture is treated with 0.9 mL of 99% triethylamine and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The residual brown syrup is partitioned between diethyl ether (150 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (250 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 150 mL) and the combined organic phases are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure (7 mm and 65°C bath temperature) to give 10.4-10.8 g (88-91% crude yield) of oxazolidine methyl ester 3 as a pale yellow oil. Analysis of crude 3 by 1H NMR indicates a chemical purity of > 95%. The product can be used without further purification.
A. (S)-( + )-2-Hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. In a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, an overhead stirrer bearing a two-bladed propeller (ca. 2.5-cm diameter), an effective reflux condenser with a drying tube packed with silica gel, and a plastic stopper are placed 2.5 L of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF,) and 60 g (1.56 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4,). The suspension is heated under reflux for 15 min, the heating mantle is switched off, and 115.1 g (1 mol) of powdered (S)-proline is added in small portions (ca. 2 g,) to the boiling mixture at such a rate as to maintain reflux. The addition requires ca. 45 min and the contents of the flask are kept boiling for an additional 1 hr. Excess lithium aluminum hydride is then decomposed by cautiously adding a solution of 28 g of potassium hydroxide in 112 mL of water (without external heating) through a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to the boiling mixture. On hydrolysis, white salts precipitate and stirring becomes difficult. After the addition is complete (ca. 25 min), the mixture is refluxed for 15 min and the hot solution is filtered by suction through a large Büchner funnel (18-cm diameter). The precipitate is pressed dry with a beaker. Any remaining prolinol is extracted from the precipitate by refluxing with 1.5 L of tetrahydrofuran for 1 hr under mechanical stirring, followed again by suction filtration. The combined filtrates are concentrated in a 2-L flask at 30°C under reduced pressure to yield 115–125 g of the crude hydroxymethylpyrrolidine as a pale-yellow oil.
The yellow distillate (ca. 40 g., m.p. 85–95°) is recrystallized from 75 ml. of methanol, cooled in an ice bath and filtered, yielding 22.5–24 g. (45–48%) of white, crystalline 2-acetyl-6-methoxynaphthalene, m.p. 106.5–108° (lit. 104–105°).3
The product is filtered on a 10-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with three successive 100-cc. portions of cold water. It is then crystallized from 2 l. of hot water, filtered, and washed twice with 100-cc. portions of cold water, once with 25 cc. of acetone, and once with 25 cc. of ether. After drying at 110° for one hour, there remains a pure white, anhydrous product weighing 110–120 g. (40–43 per cent of the theoretical amount). An arsenic analysis shows the product to be about 99 per cent pure.
A solution of 56.7 g (0.56 mol) of triethylamine in 60 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 1 hr, and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hr.
A. Ethyl 5,5-dimethylhexa-2,3-dienoate ( 1 ). A flame-dried 2-L 3-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (Teflon paddle, 6 × 2 × 0.3 cm), a temperature probe, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with ethyl (triphenylphosphoranylidene)acetate (46.4 g, 133 mmol, 1.00 equiv), dichloromethane (665 mL), and triethylamine (20.4 mL, 146 mmol, 1.10 equiv). The mixture is stirred under nitrogen until a homogeneous solution is achieved. 3,3-Dimethylbutyryl chloride (18.5 mL, 133 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added over 1 h using an addition funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 18 h during which time a precipitate forms, resulting in a cloudy heterogeneous mixture. The reaction mixture is added in three portions to a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated to a volume of ca. 230 mL using a rotary evaporator (20 °C, 20-25 mmHg). Hexanes (300 mL) is added, and the flask is manually swirled for 2 min, resulting in a precipitate. The heterogeneous suspension is filtered through silica gel (100 g) in a 600-mL glass-fritted medium porosity Büchner funnel into a 2-L round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is rinsed with hexanes (600 mL). The resulting slightly yellow solution is concentrated under rotary evaporation (20 °C, 20-25 mmHg) until 750 mL of the solvent has been removed. The heterogeneous mixture is filtered through silica gel (100 g) in a 600-mL glass fritted medium porosity Büchner funnel into a 2-L round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is rinsed with 500 mL of hexanes/diethyl ether (19:1). The solution is concentrated (20 °C, 20-25 mmHg) and left on vacuum overnight to give ethyl 5,5-dimethylhexa-2,3-dienoate (1) (16.4-16.6 g, 73-74%) as a pale yellow oil.
C. 4-Hydroxy[1-13C]benzoic acid . A 25-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 1.25 g (7.50 mmol) of ethyl 4-hydroxy[1-13C]benzoate and 11.3 mL (22.5 mmol, 3 equiv) of 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH). After the solution is stirred for 24 hr at room temperature, 17 mL of 2 M HCl is added slowly, whereby the product precipitates. Water is added (10 mL), and the mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with 1 M HCl (2 × 30 mL). Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator and drying under reduced pressure affords 1.02 g (7.34 mmol, 98%) of 4-hydroxy[1-13C]benzoic acid (mp 212-213°C), which can be used for feeding experiments without further purification.
In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 250 mL of water, 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 49.5 g (0.65 mol) of cyclopropylcarbinol; the reaction mixture is refluxed for ca. 100 min. The formation of cyclobutanol can be observed nearly instantaneously, as this alcohol is only partially soluble in water and soon separates. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel (using a three-way adapter, parallel sidearm), and the reflux condenser is replaced by an ethanol–dry ice trap connected to a U-tube immersed in an ethanol–dry ice bath to ensure condensation of the very volatile cyclobutanone. The flask is charged with an additional 48 mL (ca. 0.55 mol) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 200 mL of water and 440 g (3.5 mol) of oxalic acid dihydrate. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for ca. 15 min to saturate the solution with oxalic acid. A solution of 162 g (1.62 mol) of chromium trioxide in 250 mL of water is added dropwise with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept between 10°C and 15°C (NaCl–ice bath, −5°C to −10°C) and the generation of carbon dioxide remains gentle. The reduction of each drop of chromic acid is practically instantaneous. As the addition of the reagent proceeds (1.5–2 hr), oxalic acid gradually dissolves and a dark-blue solution containing chromium(III) salts results. Just before the end of the oxidation (ca. 10 mL of the chromic acid solution left), the cyclobutanone (with traces of cyclobutanol) trapped in the U-tube (a few milliliters) is added to the reaction mixture. After the oxidation is completed, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for ca. 1 hr to bring the reaction mixture to room temperature and to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the solution.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, are placed 1620 g. (1.5 l., 18.9 moles) of technical formaldehyde (sp. gr. 1.078/20°) and 540 g. (10 moles) of ammonium chloride. A thermometer is placed in the liquid, which is cooled to 0°. This temperature is maintained throughout the entire reaction. Stirring is commenced, and a solution of 490 g. (9.8 moles) of 98 per cent sodium cyanide in 850 cc. of water is dropped into the mixture of ammonium chloride and formaldehyde at such a rate (about 90 drops per minute) that at least six hours will be required for this addition.
In a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed stirrer having a Teflon® blade and, on the two side necks, with gas-outlet tubes connected by rubber or plastic tubing to an efficient hydrogen chloride absorption trap, 464 g. (2 moles) of D,L-10-camphorsulfonic acid is mixed with 416 g. (2 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride. The flask is immersed in ice water and, as soon as the mixture has liquefied sufficiently, the stirrer is started but must be run slowly at first because of lumps. When the vigorous reaction has subsided, the cooling bath is removed and stirring continued until the chloride is completely dissolved. The mixture is then allowed to stand for 3 or 4 hours. It is poured (Hood!) onto 500 g. of crushed ice contained in a 2-l. beaker. This mixture is immediately poured into a second beaker containing a similar quantity of crushed ice. The mixture is then poured back and forth between the two beakers until all evidence of reaction has disappeared. The fine white product is collected on a suction filter and washed several times with cold water. The yield is essentially quantitative (500 g.) of moist sulfonyl chloride which is pure enough to be used for the preparation of D,L-ketopinic acid (p. 55). When carefully dried, the crude material has m.p. 81–83° and and may be preserved in a desiccator.
The 500-ml. flask is dried by warming with a soft flame as a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the system. A solution of ethylmagnesium bromide is prepared in this flask from 12 g. (0.5 g. atom) of magnesium turnings, 60 g. (0.55 mole) of ethyl bromide (dried over calcium chloride), and 300 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask attached to a Dean and Stark constant water separator which is connected to a reflux condenser are placed 46.5 g. (45.5 ml., 0.5 mole) of redistilled aniline, 65 g. (63.5 ml., 0.5 mole) of commercial ethyl acetoacetate, 100 ml. of benzene, and 1 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The flask is heated in an oil bath at about 125°, and the water which distils out of the mixture with the refluxing benzene is removed at intervals. Refluxing is continued until no more water separates (9 ml. collects in about 3 hours) and then for an additional 30 minutes. The benzene is then distilled under reduced pressure, and the residue is transferred to a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask with an insulated column. The flask is heated in an oil or metal bath maintained at a temperature not higher than 120° while the fore-run of aniline and ethyl acetoacetate is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and at 140–160° during distillation of the product. The yield of ethyl β-anilinocrotonate boiling at 128–130° /2 mm., nD25 1.5770, is 78–82 g. (76–80%).
The crude product is best purified by distillation from a 250-cc. distilling flask fitted with an air condenser. A very small fraction (10–15 g.) of low-boiling material is obtained, and the dichloroacetone (170–175°) is then collected. It solidifies in the receiver to a white crystalline mass which weighs 200–220 g. (68–75 per cent of the theoretical amount). A few grams more may be obtained by chilling the low-boiling fraction and filtering off the water.
The crude product is dissolved in 50 mL of diethyl ether and adsorbed onto 20 g of Celite 521 by evaporation of the diethyl ether under reduced pressure. The dry Celite 521 is then added to the top of a column containing 200 g of silica gel (32–63 micron) and the column is eluted with a mobile phase of 9:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate. The fractions containing the product (Rf = 0.50, 9:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate) are collected and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 17.7 g (91%) of 1 as a colorless, crystalline, solid.
After the flask and contents have been allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 days with occasional shaking, the liquid is decanted. Three hundred milliliters of methanol> is then added carefully, and the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for 4 hours. Then 800 ml. of water is added to dissolve the salt, and the hydrocarbon layer is separated and added to the decanted liquid. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 250 ml. of ether, and the combined hydrocarbon fraction, decanted solution, and ether extract are dried over 40 g. of calcium chloride. Most of the ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residual liquid is distilled through an electrically heated, jacketed column. The fraction that boils at 180–182.5°/750 mm. is collected as n-butylbenzene and; the yield is 261–281 g. (65–70%).
B. Bis(trifluoromethyl)diazomethane. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The third neck is connected with pressure tubing to a 50-ml. capacity cold trap immersed in an acetone-dry ice cooling bath and protected from the atmosphere with a calcium chloride drying tube. The system is purged with nitrogen, and 375 ml. of benzonitrile and 120 g. (0.271 mole) of lead tetraäcetate are placed in the flask. Stirring is started and the flask is cooled with an ice bath before a solution of 45 g. (0.25 mole) of hexafluoroacetone hydrazone in 50 ml. of benzonitrile is added with the dropping funnel over a period of 1 hour. The ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour at room temperature. During this time some product collects in the cold trap. The remaining product is distilled into the trap at 10 mm. pressure by removing the drying tube and connecting the trap to a pump or aspirator (a small amount of acetic acid and other impurities can be removed by trap-to-trap distillation), yielding 20–21 ml. or 34–35 g. (76–79%) of bis(trifluoromethyl)diazomethane as a yellow liquid, b.p. 12–13°. The product is neither impact- nor static-sensitive and is stable to long storage at −78°; however, it partly decomposes with loss of nitrogen after several weeks at room temperature.
Water is added to the residue if necessary to make the volume 700 ml., and the solution is treated with 2 g. of Norit and filtered with suction. The filtrate is extracted with 100 ml. of ether (which is discarded), and acidified by the addition of 80 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After thorough chilling, preferably overnight in a refrigerator, the precipitated atrolactic acid is collected on a suction filter and air-dried at a temperature not exceeding 65°.
D. 2,3-Diaminopyridine. In an apparatus for catalytic hydrogenation 56.4 g. (0.3 mole) of 2,3-diamino-5-bromopyridine suspended in 300 ml. of 4% sodium hydroxide solution is shaken with hydrogen in the presence of 1.0 g. of 5% palladized strontium carbonate. When absorption of hydrogen is completed, the catalyst is removed by filtration, and, after saturation with potassium carbonate (about 330 g. is required), the resulting slushy mixture is extracted continuously with ether until all the precipitate completely disappears (usually about 18 hours, but this depends on the efficiency of the extraction apparatus). The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue of crude 2,3-diaminopyridine is recrystallized from benzene (about 600 ml. is required) using 3 g. of activated charcoal and filtering rapidly through a preheated Büchner funnel. The yield of 2,3-diaminopyridine, obtained as colorless needles, m.p. 115–116°, pKa 6.84, is 25.5–28.0 g. (78–86%).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer are placed 236 g. (1.5 moles) of p-chloronitrobenzene, 960 g. (4 moles) of sodium sulfide nonahydrate, and 2.5 l. of water. With rapid agitation, the reaction mixture is slowly heated to the reflux temperature. Heating is continued over a period of 20 hours.
C. 1,2-Dimethylenecyclohexane. An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a stopper is charged with potassium tert-butoxide (59.5 g, 0.53 mol) dissolved in tert-butyl alcohol–tetrahydrofuran (9:1, 400 mL total) and cooled in ice. A solution of 1-bromo-1-methyl-2-(bromomethylsulfonyl)cyclohexane (54.0 g, 0.16 mol) in tert-butyl alcohol–tetrahydrofuran (9:1, 100 mL) is added dropwise over a 1-hr period. After the addition is complete the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hr and then poured into a 2-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of water. This solution is extracted with two 150-mL portions of pentane. The combined pentane extracts are washed 8 times with water (500 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure using an efficient Vigreux column and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 11.4 g (65%) of 1,2-dimethylenecyclohexane as a colorless liquid, bp 69–70° (90 mm) (lit.2 60–61°C, 90 mm) and.
D. 3,6,9-Tris(p-tolylsulfonyl)-3,6,9-triazaundecane-1,11-dimethanesulfonate (4). A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, nitrogen inlet, and low-temperature thermometer is charged with a dried solution of 200 g. (0.306 mole) of diol 3 and 100 ml. of triethylamine in 1500 ml. of dichloromethane. The stirred solution is held at −15 to −20° in an acetone-dry ice bath as 74 g. (50 ml., 0.65 mole) of methanesulfonyl chloride is added over 10 minutes. The dry-ice bath is replaced with an ice bath, and the solution is stirred for 30 minutes, poured into a mixture of 1 l. of crushed ice and 500 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and shaken. The layers are separated, and the organic layer is washed with two 500-ml. portions of water and 500 ml. of saturated salt solution, then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solution is filtered and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure giving a white solid, which is dissolved in 250 ml. of dichloromethane and crystallized by addition of 500 ml. of ethyl acetate and cooling in an ice bath, yielding 215–235 g. (87–95%) of methanesulfonate 4, m.p. 146–148.
C. Generation of benzyne and trapping with furan. A 50-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel equipped with an argon inlet adapter and a magnetic stir bar is charged with 1.51 g (3.00 mmol) of (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2), 10 mL of dichloromethane , and 1.10 mL (15.1 mmol) of furan. The addition funnel is charged with 3.6 mL (3.6 mmol) of 1.0 M tetrabutylammonium fluoride (Bu4N+F−) in tetrahydrofuran (THF). The flask is placed in an ice bath and the tetrabutylammonium fluoride solution is added dropwise over ca. 5 min. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min, and water (20 mL) is added. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with three 10-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are washed with 15 mL of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , and filtered. The solvent is evaporated by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, and the residual oil is purified by column chromatography through 60 g of silica gel packed in a 4-cm diameter column (elution with dichloromethane) to give 0.415-0.418 g (96-97%) of 1,4-dihydronaphthalene 1,4-oxide (3) as colorless crystals, mp 52-55°C.
In a 4-l. beaker equipped with a stirrer which can be operated above the liquid level to break the foam are placed 250 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid and 250 ml. of water. The filtrate obtained above is cooled to about 50° and is added to the hydrochloric acid in small portions and at such a rate that the mixture does not foam over. If efficient stirring is used in the foam layer, this addition can be carried out in 5 minutes. The product is isolated by filtration through a Büchner funnel and is washed on the filter, first with a 250-ml. portion of dilute hydrochloric acid (prepared by diluting 50 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid to about 250 ml.) to remove anthranilic acid, and then with 500 ml. of water. The product is sucked as dry as possible and is then spread in a thin layer and allowed to air dry for about 15 hours. When easily pulverizable, the material is transferred to an oven and dried for 3 hours at 100–120°.
B. Androst-5-en-17-one, 3-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]oxy]-, (3β)- preparation (3β). A 250-mL, single-necked (24/40 joint) Erlenmeyer flask is dried at about 200 °C under vacuum (0.01 mmHg) for approximately 10 min. The flask is charged under the atmosphere of dry nitrogen with 2 (5.00 g, 17.3 mmol) and 1H-imidazole (1.77 g, 26.0 mmol), followed by N,N-dimethylformamide (25.0 mL). The resulting suspension is sonicated at 20 °C with gentle swirling until homogeneous. tert-Butyldimethylsilyl chloride (3.39 g, 22.5 mmol) is added as a solid to the reaction mixture. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar. After about 3 min of stirring, a white precipitate begins to form. The reaction is stirred for 30 min, at which time water (100 mL) is added to ensure complete product precipitation. The white clay-like substance is scraped from the glass walls of the Erlenmeyer flask, filtered under vacuum, and then dried overnight under vacuum (0.01 mmHg) at 20 °C to yield 6.83 g (98%) of 3 as a white powder.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask is placed 50 g. (0.92 mole) of sodium methoxide and. The flask is temporarily stoppered and then fitted with a nitrogen inlet tube, a sealed stirrer, and a 250-ml. pressure-equalized dropping funnel carrying a calcium chloride tube.
An additional 2.2 g. (4%) of cycloöctanone may be obtained by addition of 250 ml. of water to the green salts formed during the reaction, extraction of the mixture with ether, distillation of the ether, and addition of 12 ml. of acetone. To the acetone solution there is added sufficient chromic acid oxidizing reagent to permit the orange color of the reagent to persist, and the mixture is processed as above.
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a long reflux condenser and an efficient mechanical stirrer, are placed 92 g. (4 gram atoms) of clean metallic sodium and about 150 cc. of xylene. The sodium is finely powdered by heating the flask until the sodium melts and then cooling with very vigorous stirring. The cooled xylene is decanted, and the powdered sodium is thoroughly washed with four or five portions of dry, alcohol-free ether. About 1.2 l. of absolute ether is added, and the flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, a 250-cc. separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer.
After stirring has been continued for two hours longer, the crock is surrounded by hot water or steam and warmed to 50° without stirring. The mixture is then allowed to stand until cool, when the aqueous layer is drawn off by means of a siphon. The upper oily layer is transferred to a 12-l. flask and distilled in a current of steam until no more oil passes over; about 10 l. of distillate is collected. The water is drawn off and the benzene removed by distillation, by means of a 2-l. round-bottomed flask and a fractionating column about 90 cm. long. When benzene no longer distils over, the distillation is continued in the same apparatus under reduced pressure, and the fraction that boils at 94–96°/20 mm. is collected. A small amount of dark-colored residue remains in the flask. The yield of almost colorless o-tolunitrile is 300–330 g. (64–70 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The combined crude material is crystallized from 75 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and yields 37–39 g. of slightly colored material, m.p. 123–124°. A second crystallization from alcohol gives 34–36 g. of colorless product melting at the same temperature. By the systematic working of the alcoholic mother liquors, an additional 5–6 g. of pure material is obtained, making the total yield 40–41 g. (57–58 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 2,3-Bis(phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-butadiene (1). A solution of 17.0 g of 2,3-bis(phenylsulfinyl)-1,3-butadiene (56.3 mmol) and 34 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30–35%) in 170 mL of glacial acetic acid is placed in a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and thermometer. The solution is warmed using an oil bath such that a reaction temperature of 90°C is maintained for 5 hr. To the hot solution is added 40 mL of water and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 12 hr. The resulting precipitate is collected, washed with water (50 mL), cold methanol (30 mL), and ether (100 mL). The filter cake (13.9 g) is dissolved in 100 mL of hot dichloromethane and 100 mL of hexane is added slowly. After standing at 25°C for 1 day, the crystalline solid is collected and washed with 100 mL of ether to give 11.6 g (61%) of 2,3-bis(phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-butadiene.2 Concentration and recrystallization of the mother liquor affords an additional 1.7 g (9%) of the disulfone.
A. (Perfluorohexyl)ethylmagnesium iodide . A 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a stirring bar and a reflux condenser is dried in an oven overnight and then cooled under argon. Dry ether (20 mL) and 2-perfluorohexyl-1-iodoethane (1 mL) are added to magnesium (2.91 g, 120 mmol) in the dried flask equipped with a reflux condenser, thermometer and an outlet to argon gas. The reaction is initiated by sonication for 30 min. Additional dry ether (70 mL) is added to the mixture while stirring. In a separate, dry, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask cooled under argon, dry ether (45 mL) is combined with 2-perfluorohexyl-1-iodoethane (13.70 mL, total of 60 mmol). This separate mixture is slowly added to the reaction mixture over 1 hr with stirring. The addition rate is adjusted to keep a constant temperature of about 30°C. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 2.5 hr in an oil bath at 50°C and allowed to stand after removal from the bath until it reaches room temperature.
The solid is suspended in 100 mL of dry hexane and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (24.0 g, 0.16 mol) is added dropwise via a glass syringe over 30 min with constant stirring, during which time vigorous gas evolution occurs; the solid gradually dissolves, and the solution develops a yellow-orange color. Stirring is continued at room temperature for 1 hr, then the reaction mixture is left for 1-2 hr without stirring. A semi-solid phase separates and the top layer is transferred via cannula into a dry, 250 mL round-bottomed flask. The flask is placed in a −20°C freezer for 36 hr. Large crystals form and the mother liquor is transferred via cannula to another dry, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask. The crystals are dried under reduced pressure at 0°C for 5 hr giving 40.8 g (78%) of dicyclohexylboron trifluoromethanesulfonate . The mother liquors are concentrated to dryness under nitrogen (N2) using a rotary evaporator. The residue is redissolved in 20 mL of dry hexane and crystallized in a −20°C freezer as described above to give an additional 7 g of product. The total yield of dicyclohexylboron trifluoromethanesulfonate is 47.8 g (92%). The isolated crystals are dissolved in hexane in a graduated cylinder equipped with a ground glass joint and a stopcock-equipped syringe inlet to make a 1 M stock solution.
A. 1,3-Dibromo-1-phenylpropane. In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed stirrer and two efficient reflux condensers are placed 199 g. (1.0 mole) of 1-bromo-3-phenylpropane, 187 g. (1.05 moles) of N-bromosuccinimide, 3 g. of benzoyl peroxide, and 1.2 l. of carbon tetrachloride. The mixture is heated cautiously with a flame to reflux until a spontaneous reaction starts; ice-bath cooling is then applied if necessary. When the spontaneous reaction subsides, the stirring is stopped; if more than a negligible amount of N-bromosuccinimide remains in the bottom of the flask (succinimide rises to the surface of the solvent), heating and stirring are continued until an evolution of hydrogen bromide is noted. The mixture is cooled, and the solids are removed by suction filtration and washed with carbon tetrachloride. The washings are combined with the original filtrate, and the bulk of the carbon tetrachloride is removed by distillation at water aspirator pressure and a bath temperature of 40–50°. The remainder of the solvent is removed at the same bath temperature and at 0.1 mm. pressure. The orange-yellow residue (nearly 100% of the theoretical yield of 1,3-dibromo-1-phenylpropane) is used without further purification in the next step.
The filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure on a water bath until a semi-crystalline mass remains; this is further desiccated by evaporating twice under reduced pressure with 50-cc. portions of absolute ethyl alcohol. The resulting crystalline cake is crushed with 50 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, filtered, and the process repeated. The white, crystalline product is almost pure methylhydrazine sulfate and contains very little hydrazine sulfate. After drying in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride, the yield is 105–110 g. (76–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). For purification, the sulfate is dissolved in about 250 cc. of boiling 80 per cent ethyl alcohol, and any undissolved material (chiefly hydrazine sulfate) is filtered. On cooling, the methylhydrazine sulfate separates in white plates, which are filtered with suction and washed with a little absolute alcohol. After drying over calcium chloride, the first fraction, m.p. 141–142°, weighs 70–75 g. (51–54 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 5-l. three-necked flask, suspended over a steam bath, are placed 300 g. (1.63 moles) of technical 2,4-dinitrophenol and 2.5 l. of water. The flask is fitted with an efficient stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer which dips below the surface of the mixture. After the stirrer has been started, 600 g. (11.6 moles) of ammonium chloride and 100 ml. of concentrated aqueous ammonia (about 28%) are added, and the mixture is heated to 85°. The steam is turned off, and the mixture is allowed to cool. When the temperature reaches 70°, 700 g. (5.4 moles) of 60% fused sodium sulfide is added in portions of about 100 g. at 5-minute intervals. After two or three such additions the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches 80–85°; it is kept in this range either by adding the remaining portions of sodium sulfide at 10-minute intervals or by wrapping the flask with a wet cloth and continuing the additions at 5-minute intervals. After all the sodium sulfide has been added, the reaction mixture is heated at 85° for 15 minutes and then filtered through a heated 6-in. Büchner funnel.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube is immersed in an ice-salt bath and charged with 38 g. (0.25 mole) of silver cyanate, 34.7 g. of 75% 1,2-dihydronaphthalene (0.20 mole,), and 400 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. Stirring is begun, and when the temperature of the contents of the flask has reached 0°, 50.8 g. (0.200 mole) of iodine is added in one portion. The brown mixture is stirred vigorously for 2 hours at 0–5°, then for 6 hours at room temperature. The resulting mixture, which still retains the color of iodine, is filtered through a layer of filter aid. The filtrate is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel and washed with 75-ml. portions of 15% sodium bisulfite solution until the ether layer is nearly colorless. The resulting ether solution is concentrated to 200 ml. using a rotary evaporator at room temperature (20 mm.).
Water (100 ml.) and ether (350 ml.) are added to the condensate in the receiver D, and the mixture is shaken. The aqueous layer is removed, and the ethereal solution is washed with 75 ml. of 6N sodium hydroxide solution. The ethereal solution is washed with water until the washings are neutral and is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed under reduced pressure by warming with a water bath, and the residue is distilled through a Vigreux or packed column. The azelanitrile is collected at 120–121°/0.2 mm., 175–176°/6 mm., in a yield of 50–54 g. (63–68%), n25D 1.4443–1.4448 and.
The flask A is surrounded by an ice-salt bath and the stirrer is started. When the temperature of the acid has dropped to 10°, 132 g. (3 moles) of ethylene oxide is added over a period of about two and one-half hours. The stirring is continued for one hour after all of the ethylene oxide has been added and the temperature is maintained below 10° during the reaction.
Finally, the sides of the addition funnel are rinsed with approximately 10 mL of ether using a 20-mL plastic syringe, and the ethereal solution of iodine is added dropwise over 25 min to the stirring slurry of acetylide. Upon completion of the addition, a substantial mass of iodine is scraped from the tip of the addition funnel into the reaction vessel using a spatula. The cold bath is removed, and the solution is allowed to warm to 20 &Degree;C over 2.5 h. A septum is removed, and distilled water (100 mL) is added cautiously through the open neck. The resulting biphasic mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the organic phase is isolated. The aqueous phase is extracted with hexanes (100 mL), and the combined organic phases are washed with two 200-mL portions of water, followed by 50 mL of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), filtered through a Büchner funnel (150 mmHg), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear, light yellow oil that is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottom flask and distilled under vacuum using a short-path still to give 19.9 g (84%) of iodoalkyne 4 as a clear, colorless liquid.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a vent is placed in a water bath and charged with 600 ml. of 98% sulfuric acid. Powdered adamantane [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 5, 16 (1973)], (100 g., 0.735 mole), is added in one portion to the stirred acid, and the mixture is heated rapidly (with the water bath) to an internal temperature of 70°. The internal temperature is then raised gradually to 80° over a 2-hour period while vigorous stirring is maintained. After stirring at 80° is continued for an additional 2 hours, the temperature is raised to 82°. When almost all the adamantane is dissolved, the residual sublimed material is scraped and rinsed from the walls of the flask and. When GC analysis indicates that 2–3% of adamantanol is present, the hot reaction mixture is poured immediately onto 800 g. of crushed ice, giving a 1500-ml. suspension containing crude adamantanone.
Dry chlorine gas is admitted into a solution of 104 g. (1.00 mole) of cycloöctatetraene in 150 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride contained in a tared, 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a gas-inlet tube, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is maintained between −28° and −30° throughout the addition, which is terminated after 71 g. (1.0 mole) of chlorine has been added. After the addition, which takes approximately 1 hour, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0° and 50 g. of powdered sodium carbonate is added, and the contents are shaken gently for several minutes. This treatment removes any hydrochloric acid which may have been produced during the reaction. The mixture is then filtered directly into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask containing 135 g. (0.951 mole) of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate. A condenser is fitted to the flask and the solution is heated at gentle reflux for 3 hours. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude Diels-Alder adduct, which will slowly solidify on standing, is used directly in the next step.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a good mechanical stirrer is placed 123 g. (1.5 moles) of cyclohexene (p. 183), and to it is added about one-fourth the calculated amount of the hypochlorous acid solution. The mixture is kept between 15° and 20°, and stirred vigorously until a 1-cc. test portion gives no yellow color when it is treated with potassium iodide solution and dilute hydrochloric acid. When the first portion of the hypochlorous acid has reacted, a second is added and the process is repeated. When all the hypochlorous acid has been added and the reaction is complete, the oily layer should be on the bottom and a very slight excess of hypochlorous acid should be present, as indicated by the potassium iodide test. If these conditions are not fulfilled, 100-cc. portions of the hypochlorous acid solution are added until the reaction is shown to be complete.
E. 3,6-Diazoido-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone. A solution of 10 g. (0.035 mole) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-3,6-dichloro-1,4-benzoquinone in 375 ml. of methanol is cooled to 5–15°. To the solution is added, over 1–2 minutes, a solution of 5 g. (0.08 mole) of sodium azide in 15 ml. of water. The initial yellow solution becomes orange during addition of the azide. The flask is then cooled to −5° to −10° for at least 4 hours. The product precipitates from the solution and is collected by filtration, yielding 8.3–8.8 g. (80–85%) of 3,6-diazido-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone, m.p. 88.9–90° (dec.), which is recrystallized at room temperature by dissolving it in a minimum amount of chloroform, filtering, and adding 2 parts of 95% ethanol to the chloroform solution. The resulting solution is cooled to −5° to −10°; the crystalline precipitate is isolated (86% recovery) by filtration, with no appreciable change in melting point.
C. (R)-3-(tert-Butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropanal . A 500-mL, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 10.00 g (84.67 mmol) of methyl (R)-(−)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpropionate, and 100 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The solution is cooled to 0°C and 14.4 g (211 mmol) of imidazole is added. Upon dissolution of the imidazole, 23.1 mL (88.9 mmol) of tert-butyldiphenylchlorosilane (DPSCl) is added dropwise via syringe. After 10 min, the cooling bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction is quenched by the addition of 200 mL of pentane and 40 mL of water (H2O). The layers are separated and the pentane layer is washed with brine (75 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with pentane (3 × 75 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Filtration and concentration under reduced pressure followed by purification by flash chromatography yield 29.9 g (99%) of methyl (R)-3-(tert-butyldiphenylsilyloxy)-2-methylpropionate as a clear oil.
B. N-p-Tolylsulfonyl (E)-1-phenylethylideneimine (3). Into a round-bottomed 300-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added N-p-tolylsulfinylketimine 2 (5.2 g, 20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and CH2Cl2 (75 mL). The solution is cooled to 0 °C and commercially available m-CPBA (4.5 g, 20 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added slowly (portions of 1.0 g per min) to the solution, which is open to the atmosphere. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and the reaction is monitored by TLC. After five min, the mixture is diluted with CH2Cl2 (50 mL), transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (5 × 25 mL), and the organic phase is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solution is filtered into a single-necked, 300-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 10 mmHg) to afford crude 3 as a white solid, which is diluted with 7 mL of CH2Cl2 and charged on a silica gel column (150 g, 5.5 cm × 18 cm). The column is eluted initially with AcOEt/hexanes (10:90) until the N-sulfinylketimine 2 emerges, and then the elution is then continued with AcOEt/hexanes (10:50). The product-containing fractions are concentrated to afford N-sulfonylketimine 3 (4.23 g, 77%) as a white solid.
A rubber tube from an inverted cylinder of liquid ammonia is attached to a glass tube which extends beneath the surface of 325 ml. of 90% ethanol in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Ammonia is passed into the ethanol until the weight increases by 41 g. (2.4 moles). The flask is cooled in ice water occasionally in order to hasten the absorption of the ammonia.
A 100-mL glass autoclave is charged with 34 g (0.50 mol) of isoprene and 7.3 g (0.10 mol) of diethylamine under nitrogen. The contents are cooled to 3–5°C using an ice–salt bath, and 3.7 mL (0.006 mol) of a 1.62 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is added dropwise by syringe while stirring. The resulting slightly yellow solution is blanketed carefully with dry nitrogen, and the vessel is sealed. The solution is heated to 65°C and stirred for 13 hr. The vessel is then cooled using an ice–salt bath, the contents are poured into 15 mL of water, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 30 mL of diethyl ether. The organic layers are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 16.1–18.0 g (77–86%) of N,N-diethylnerylamine as a colorless liquid, bp 83–84°C (1.5 mm) and.
The malononitrile begins to distil at 113°/30 mm. (125°/50 mm.). The temperature of the oil bath is slowly raised over a period of twenty-five minutes to 180° and the nitrile collected between 113° and 125°. When the distillation has almost ceased, the oil bath is removed so as to prevent discoloration of the product. The yield of crude nitrile is 80–95 g. (67–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). The nitrile may be purified by vacuum distillation with about 10 per cent loss; it is collected between 113° and 120°/30 mm. One distillation yields a water-clear liquid, which quickly freezes to an ice-like solid melting at 28–30°. The product has a faint odor resembling that of acetamide.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed, short-necked flask, 1363 g. (10 moles) of anhydrous zinc chloride is dissolved in 864 cc. (10 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, the flask being cooled to prevent loss of hydrogen chloride. To this solution is added 371 g. (5 moles) of n-butyl alcohol. The flask is attached to a vertical, water-cooled reflux condenser, the top of which carries a thermometer and a goose-neck tube connected with an efficient downward condenser. To the end of the downward condenser is attached a 1-l. Florence flask which is connected to a 250-cc. Erlenmeyer flask by a bent tube. A tube from the second receiving vessel is connected with a gas-absorption trap or to a funnel inverted over 800 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution in a 1-l. beaker. Rubber stoppers are used throughout. Both the receiving vessels are cooled in a large ice-salt bath.
A mixture of 22 g. (0.1 mole) of iodosobenzene (p. 483), 24 g. (0.1 mole) of iodoxybenzene (p. 485), and 200 ml. of 1 N sodium hydroxide is gently stirred for 24 hours. The resulting brown slurry is thoroughly stirred with 1 l. of cold water, and, after the mixture settles, the supernatant solution of diphenyliodonium iodate is decanted through a filter. The solid residue is extracted twice with 500-ml. portions of water, and the extracts are separated, by decantation through a filter, from the small amount of tarry residue. An aqueous solution of 20 g. (0.12 mole) of potassium iodide is added to the combined filtrates. After the bulky white precipitate of diphenyliodonium iodide has stood for an hour or two, with occasional shaking, it is filtered with suction, washed with water, and dried on porous tile at room temperature. The product weighs 29–30 g. (70–72%) and melts at 172–175° with vigorous decomposition.
B. 3-Acetyl-2,4-dimethylfuran. To a solution of 8.7 g. (0.087 mole) of acetylacetone in 175 ml. of 0.5 M ethanolic sodium ethoxide (0.087 mole), contained in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, fitted with a condenser topped with a calcium chloride drying tube, is added a solution of 15.75 g. (0.0870 mole) of dimethyl-2-propynylsulfonium bromide in 150 ml. of ethanol. The mixture is refluxed until the odor of dimethyl sulfide is no longer appreciable. The reaction flask is then fitted with a 30-cm., helix-packed column, and by heating the flask with a water bath, ethanol is distilled through the column. The residue is treated with 200 ml. of ether, and the suspension is filtered. Ether is distilled from the filtrate at atmospheric pressure, and the residue is distilled, giving 9.7 g. (81%) of 3-acetyl-2,4-dimethylfuran and, b.p. 90–95° (12 mm.), n24D 1.4965.
(A) Isonitrosoacetanilide.—In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 90 g. (0.54 mole) of chloral hydrate and 1200 cc. of water. To this solution are then added, in order: 1300 g. of crystallized sodium sulfate; a solution of 46.5 g. (0.5 mole) of aniline in 300 cc. of water to which 51.2 g. (43 cc., 0.52 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) has been added to dissolve the amine; and, finally, a solution of 110 g. (1.58 moles) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 500 cc. of water. The flask is heated over a wire gauze by a Meker burner so that vigorous boiling begins in about forty to forty-five minutes. After one to two minutes of vigorous boiling the reaction is complete. During the heating period, some crystals of isonitrosoacetanilide separate. On cooling the solution in running water the remainder crystallizes, is filtered with suction, and air-dried. The yield is 65–75 g. (80–91 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 175°.
B. 3-Chloro-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone. A 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with a solution of 112 g. (0.385 mole) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-5,6-dichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione in 800 ml. of diethyl ether. A solution of 28.4 g. (0.383 mole) of diethylamine in 50 ml. of ether is added in one portion to the vigorously swirled flask. The reaction is instantaneous, resulting in a voluminous precipitate. The mixture is washed with two 1-l. portions of water, then with 500 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride. The yellow ether solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 96–97 g. (98–99%) of 3-chloro-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone as a yellow oil which is used without further purification.
The deep red solution is cooled in an ice bath and neutralized by the addition, with shaking, of an ice-cold solution of 15 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 200 cc. of water. The ether layer is separated, washed with water, and dried over sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by dropping the solution from a separatory funnel the stem of which extends to the bottom of an evacuated Claisen flask heated on the steam bath. The residue is a pale yellow oil consisting of a mixture of ethyl α-ethoxalyl-γ-phenylbutyrate and unchanged ethyl oxalate.
C. 2,5-Di-tert-butyl-3,5,6-trichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione. A 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with a solution of 96.6 g. (0.379 mole) of crude 3-chloro-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone in 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The reaction flask is equipped with an efficient magnetic stirring bar, and chlorine gas is introduced. The reaction is complete in 4-5 hours, at which time the solution is flushed with nitrogen to expel excess chlorine. Approximately 1 l. of water is added, and the resulting mixture is extracted with 300 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane solution is washed three times with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 116–117 g. (94%) of 2,5-di-tert-butyl-3,5,6-trichloro-2-cyclohexene-1,4-dione as a lemon yellow oil which is used directly in the next step.
After the addition is complete, stirring is continued at −30°C for 10 min to produce a gray–blue or dark-blue solution of the cuprate.
An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum. The flask is purged with argon and is charged with the crude α-silyl ketone (from 30.00 g, 118 mmol of α-silyl chloride) and dry THF (500 mL). Methyllithium (1.4 M, 118 mL, 165 mmol) is added to the addition funnel via cannula. The α-silyl ketone solution is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and methyllithium is added dropwise over approximately 1 hr after which the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr. A second, oven-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is charged with 27 g of potassium hydride (35% wt/wt dispersion in oil which is rinsed with three 100-mL portions of dry diethyl ether), and diluted with 100 mL of dry THF, and 0.200 g of 18-crown-6 (0.76 mmol) is added. The β-alkoxysilane solution prepared above is added to the potassium hydride slurry via cannula, and the mixture is stirred for 16 hr. Excess potassium hydride is quenched with isopropyl alcohol (~50 mL) until no further hydrogen gas is evolved. Saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (250-mL) is added to the reaction mixture which is then combined with 250 mL of diethyl ether in a separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed successively with three 250-mL portions of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 250 mL of brine, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the residue via flash column chromatography (silica gel 230-400 mesh, 450 g, eluant hexanes) provides 11.19–11.62 g (E)-6-methyl-6-dodecene, (52–54% from the α-silyl chloride) as a 95:5 E/Z ratio of isomers and.
On cooling to room temperature, a large mass of dirty-yellow crystals separates. The liquid layers are decanted from the yellow solid, and the aqueous (lower) layer is separated and discarded. The solid is washed in the reaction flask by stirring with 500 ml. of benzene. This slurry of solid in benzene is filtered and the solid sucked dry on a Büchner funnel. This filtrate is combined with the upper organic layer from the original reaction mixture, and the combined benzene solution is washed with 500 ml. of water, 500 ml. of 2–3% aqueous sodium carbonate, and 200 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution. Benzene and water are removed from this solution by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The still residue is cooled to room temperature, and precipitated solid is removed by filtration and added to the large crop of solid from the original reaction mixture. The combined solids are washed twice with 300 ml. of water, once with 400 ml. of 2–3% aqueous sodium carbonate, and once with 300–400 ml. of water and sucked dry on a Büchner funnel.
Crotnaldehyde (70 g., 1 mole) and 300 ml. of water are stirred with a glass-enclosed bar magnet while chlorine gas is passed in from a cylinder. The reaction vessel, equipped with a water-cooled reflux condenser, is cooled in an ice bath to maintain the temperature at about 10°, and the introduction of chlorine is continued for about 2 hours until the temperature does not rise rapidly when the bath is removed. At this point, the total weight increase is 70–80 g. and the upper oil layer has been converted entirely to a lower layer of viscous white oil. The reaction mixture is heated for 30 minutes at reflux temperature with slow stirring to dehydrate the chlorohydrin. The light-brown oil layer is extracted with chloroform, and the extract is washed twice with water and dried thoroughly over anhydrous magnesium sulfate in the refrigerator. The dry solution is filtered into a thoroughly dried flask equipped with a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a bubbler tube for the introduction of dry chlorine. Over a period of 2.5 hours, chlorine, passed first through a drying tube filled with Drierite, is introduced. The temperature in the reaction mixture is kept at 0° to 10° by an ice bath, and chlorination is continued until the weight increase indicates that 1 mole of chlorine has been added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hour longer in the ice bath. Then dry carbon dioxide (or nitrogen) is bubbled through the solution at room temperature to remove excess chlorine. The reaction vessel is fitted to a dry 20-mm. by 12-in. Vigreux column wrapped with glass-wool insulation and equipped with a vacuum-jacketed, total take-off-type still head and a water-cooled condenser. The receiver is a dry tared flask with side arm leading to a manometer and, through a Drierite-filled U-tube, to a water pump. Dry carbon dioxide is passed through the still pot during the distillation. The chloroform is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The pressure is then decreased, and the pale yellow butyrchloral is distilled. The yield is 91–93 g. (52–53%); b.p. 57–60°/23 mm.; n25D = 1.4712–1.4740. The oil has a persistent and characteristic but not unpleasant odor.
In a 5-l. round-buttoned flask, fitted with a stopper holding a condenser set for downward distillation and a thermometer which will extend well into the liquid, are placed 4 kg. (3711 cc., 47–53 moles) of technical formaldehyde (35–40 per cent; sp. gr. 1.078 at 20°) (see Note 1 on p. 378) and 2 kg. (37 moles) of technical ammonium chloride. The mixture is heated on the steam bath until no more distillate comes over and then over a flame until the temperature of the solution reaches 104°. The temperature is held at this point until no more distillate comes over (four to six hours). The distillate, which consists of methylal, methyl formate, and water, may be treated as described in.
At this time 270 ml. of toluene is added to the mixture and the condenser is changed for distillation. An azeotropic mixture of ethanol, toluene, and water is distilled at 75–78° with the bath at 105–110°. When the temperature begins to drop, 525 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol is added and the mixture is again heated under reflux for 12–16 hours. Again 270 ml. of toluene is added, and the azeotropic mixture is distilled until the vapor temperature falls to 68°. After the residue is cooled, the system is evacuated to 25–35 mm. and the remaining ethanol and toluene are distilled.
The residual aldehyde-bisulfite solution is cooled to 40–50°, a suspension of 80 g. of sodium bicarbonate in 200 cc. of water is added carefully, and the free aldehyde is removed by steam distillation. The upper layer of the distillate is separated, washed with three 50-cc. portions of water, dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled through a 20-cm. column. The yield of n-hexaldehyde b.p. 126–129° , is 45–50 g. (45–50 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Racemic 1,1'-bi-2-naphthyl pentanoate. A suspension of 203 g (0.71 mol) of racemic 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol and 215 mL (1.54 mol) of triethylamine in 2 L of ethyl ether is stirred magnetically in a 4-L Erlenmeyer flask. Over a period of 20 min 185 mL (1.56 mol) of pentanoyl chloride is added and the suspension is stirred for an additional hour to ensure complete reaction. The mixture is poured into a 6-L separatory funnel and washed twice with 2-L portions of aqueous 1 M sodium bicarbonate and once with a 2-L portion of water resulting in a clear yellow-orange ether solution.
The chemical purity of the compound is checked by 1NMR (250 MHz) and thin-layer chromatography (silica gel, eluent: ethyl acetate), which show the complete absence of the corresponding sulfide and sulfone.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a ball-joint sealed stirrer and a Soxhlet extractor (70 mm. internal diameter × 300 mm. length of body) carrying a large-capacity condenser, are placed 1.8 l. of dry ether and 38 g. (1 mole) of finely divided lithium aluminum hydride. In the Soxhlet cup is placed 160 g. (0.75 mole) of N-methyllauramide (m.p. 67–69°). The mixture is heated under gentle reflux with efficient stirring over a 5-hour period and then stirred overnight at room temperature; the N-methyllauramide is extracted from the cup during the first 3 hours.
A. (±)-1-(Dimethylphenylsilyl)-1-buten-3-ol (2a) . A solution of 10.0 g (0.143 mol) of racemic 3-butyn-2-ol dissolved in 255 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF,) in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and nitrogen atmosphere is prepared. Dimethylphenylsilane (21.4 g, 0.157 mol) and a small piece of sodium metal (ca. 5 mg) are placed in the reaction mixture. The solution is stirred for 15 min and 12 mg (2.05 × 10−5 mol) of bis(η-divinyltetramethyldisiloxane)tri-tert-butylphosphineplatinum(0) is added. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for 12 hr. The orange solution is cooled to ambient temperature, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield a crude orange residue containing 2a. The oil is subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (gradient elution 5, 10, 20, 35% EtOAc/hexanes ) providing 25.4 g (123.23 mmol, 86%) of pure 2a as a yellow oil.
On digestion of this solid mass with 1 l. of ice and water, the sodium salt of the enol dissolves in the water, and the unreacted ester is removed by extracting the aqueous layer with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The formyl derivative settles out as an oil upon acidification of the aqueous layer with dilute sulfuric acid. The oil is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether, and the ethereal extract is washed several times with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is distilled, and, to remove traces of ethyl formate, the oil is heated on a steam bath under a pressure of 20–30 mm. for 1 hour. The remaining yellow formyl derivative weighs 27–29 g..
Water (1.5 l.) is added and the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer, which contains the potassium salt of 3-acetyloxindole, is separated and is then extracted with ethyl ether three times to remove a purple impurity. The aqueous layer is then made acidic to litmus by addition of hydrochloric acid; this causes precipitation of crude, tan-colored 3-acetyloxindole. The mixture is chilled, and the product is collected by suction filtration and washed well on the filter with water. The yield of crude 3-acetyloxindole, m.p. 204–206°, is 65–68 g. (74–78%). It may be purified by recrystallizing it from 1.7 l. of chloroform in the presence of 2 g. of decolorizing carbon. A heated filter funnel must be used in separating the carbon because the product starts to crystallize only slightly below the boiling point of chloroform. The recrystallized 3-acetyloxindole weighs 53–59 g. (61–67%) and is in the form of white needles, m.p. 204–205.5°.
B. cis-1-Acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene. A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a nitrogen-vacuum inlet, and a rubber septum is charged with 17.5 g (0.1 mol) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene, 0.49 g (2.2 mol) of palladium acetate and 2.4 g (9.0 mmol) of triphenylphosphine. The flask is flushed with nitrogen. To the flask is added 550 mL of a 0.2 M solution (0.11 mol) of sodium dimethyl malonate in tetrahydrofuran (THF) by syringe. The flask is again flushed with nitrogen and the reaction mixture, which now has turned yellow, is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The flask is opened and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate is added. The stirring is continued for 20 min, and then 100 mL of water and 200 mL of ether are added. The contents of the flask are transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated. The remaining aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 300 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with 200 mL of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 400 mL, and then filtered through a short silica gel column. Removal of the rest of the solvent by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure gives 30.4–31.3 g of a light-brown oil. Excess dimethyl malonate is removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 100°C (1 mm). Kugelrohr distillation (140°C, 0.2 mm) of the remaining crude product affords 25.9–26.7 g (91%) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene as a light-brown oil. Analysis by GLC indicates a chemical purity of 95–98%.
The combined filtrate and washings are distilled at reduced pressure, using a water pump, until all acetic acid and acetic anhydride have been removed. An oil pump is then connected, and the distillation is continued. β-Methylglutaric anhydride is collected at 118–122°/3.5 mm. The yield of semisolid anhydride is 46–58 g. (60–76%).
This mixture is heated to 70° and an additional 195 g. (66.5 ml., 1.22 moles) of bromine added over a half-hour interval. After the bromine addition, the temperature is raised to 80° and the mixture held at that temperature for 3 hours. Air is blown into the cooled reaction until the excess bromine and hydrogen bromide are removed. This process usually requires one hour.
Fluoboric acid is made concurrently with the diazotization by the addition, in small amounts, of 1 kg. (16.2 moles) of boric acid (u.s.p. crystals) to 2150 g. (65 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid. The addition is carried out in two 3-l. flasks coated with wax which are shaken and kept cold by immersion in iced water. The temperature of the acid should not be allowed to rise above 20–25°.
A. 4-Benzyloxy-2-butanone. A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser mounted with a nitrogen inlet, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 4.40 g (0.050 mol) of 4-hydroxy-2-butanone, 50 mL of dry toluene, and 13.9 g (0.060 mol) of freshly prepared silver oxide. The suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 12.0 g (0.070 mol) of benzyl bromide is added over ca. 5 min. The ice bath is removed, and the mixture is allowed to stir for 18 hr at room temperature. The suspension is filtered through Celite, the filter cake is washed with two 50-mL portions of toluene, and the combined filtrates are evaporated under reduced pressure. The remaining liquid, which weighs 9.6–10.4 g, is dissolved in 15 mL of 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane. The cloudy solution is applied to a 5-cm × 47.5-cm column prepared with 380–385 g of silica gel packed in 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane. The column is eluted with 5% tetrahydrofuran in hexane, and 250-mL fractions are collected and analyzed by TLC. A total of 12 or 13 fractions (3–3.25 L) is collected first to separate benzyl bromide, dibenzyl ether, and other minor by-products. The product is then eluted with 0.5–1.0 L of tetrahydrofuran, the solvent is evaporated, and the remaining 6.0–6.5 g of liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. After separation of a 0.7–1.0 g forerun, bp 30–68°C (0.2 mm), consisting mainly of benzyl alcohol, 3.87–4.33 g (43–49%) of 4-benzyloxy-2-butanone, bp 77–79°C (0.2 mm), nD25 1.5018 is collected.
The condenser is then arranged for downward distillation, and when about 1 l. of ether has distilled the receiver is changed and 1 l. of dry benzene is added; distillation is continued with stirring until the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 65°. The mixture is then boiled under reflux for one hour. Usually by this time it has become so viscous that stirring is no longer efficient. The mixture is then allowed to cool and is decomposed with 2 l. of an ice-water mixture. The precipitated magnesium hydroxide is dissolved by adding a sufficient quantity of 30 per cent sulfuric acid and enough ice to keep the mixture cold.
After the complete removal of halogen and metallic ions, the solution is concentrated to a volume of about 100 cc., and 300 cc. of absolute alcohol is added. Then the amino acid is precipitated by slowly adding 500 cc. of ether with stirring and cooling.
B. (Z)-1-Menthoxy-1-butene. A dry, 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 14.0 g (67.2 mmol) of 1-menthoxy-1-butyne, 0.7 g of 10% palladium on barium sulfate and 180 mL of pyridine. The flask is capped with a rubber septum and by means of syringe needles is degassed and connected to a hydrogen-filled balloon. The mixture is stirred for 6 hr, whereupon the hydrogen is replaced with argon, and the reaction mixture is filtered through a glass frit under water aspirator pressure. The filtrate is diluted with 300 mL of pentane and washed first with saturated copper sulfate solution (5 × 120 mL) and then with water (1 × 200 mL). The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to give 15.8 g of a yellow oil. Bulb-to-bulb distillation (0.02 mm, oven temperature 70–90°C) provides 12.7 g (90%) of (Z)-1-menthoxy-1-butene as a colorless oil.
A. p-Tolyl 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl sulfone. In a flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a nitrogen inlet and glass stoppers are placed 200 mL of dry dichloromethane and 29.4 g (0.22 mol) of freshly powdered anhydrous aluminum chloride. After the addition of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (41.9 g, 0.22 mol), the resulting dark-brown mixture is shaken occasionally for 20 min at room temperature.
B. N-Benzyl-4-hexyn-1-amine (2). An oven-dried, 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum inlet is flushed with argon and charged with 200 mg of sodium iodide. The crude mesylate 1, 40 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide and 10.9 g (102 mmol) of benzylamine are added via syringe. The resulting solution is heated in an oil bath at 47–53°C for 5 hr and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The reaction solution is poured into a separatory funnel containing 200 mL of aqueous 1% sodium hydroxide solution and the resulting mixture is extracted with ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with brine (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue (ca. 9 g) is purified by flash chromatography (ca. 300 g of silica gel using 1:1 hexane-ether containing 5% triethylamine as the eluent) to give 7.2–7.5 g (75–79% overall) of 2 as a colorless liquid.
C. Homogeranylbenzene (3).A magnetic stirring bar (round, with removable pivot ring, 40 mm length and 8 mm diameter) is added to the flask containing crude geranyl diethyl phosphate, which is dried under vacuum (20 min, 23 °C, 1 mmHg), back-filled with argon and sealed with a rubber septum and argon inlet. The viscous yellow oil is dissolved in dry THF (30 mL) and cooled in a -45 °C dry ice-cooled acetone bath. A solution of benzylmagnesium chloride in THF (0.5 M, 320 mL, 160 mmol, 2 equiv) is cannulated into the stirring geranyl diethyl phosphate solution over the course of 20 min, with the continuous addition of dry ice to the cold bath to maintain its temperature between -40 °C and -45 °C. Upon completion of the addition of the Grignard reagent, the cold bath is allowed to warm slowly for 2.5 h (to 5 °C) and then is removed. The light brown solution is stirred for an additional 2 h at 23 °C. Saturated aqueous NH4Cl (75 mL) and water (75 mL) are added carefully to quench any remaining Grignard reagent and the biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 min (slight exotherm). This mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with hexanes:EtOAc (2:1, 3 × 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (150 mL) and brine (150 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered, then concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 150 → 10 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (23 °C, 1 mmHg, 1 h). The crude yellow oil is then pipetted onto a column of packed silica gel (360 g, 80 mm diameter) and transferred quantitatively by adding hexanes rinses (3 × 5 mL). The column is eluted with hexanes (300 mL), then fraction collection is initiated (30 mL each) with further elution being performed with hexanes:CH2Cl2 (19:1, 900 mL) followed by hexanes:CH2Cl2 (9:1, 900 mL). The desired product is found in pure form in fractions 17-43 (fractions 44-50 are contaminated with bibenzyl and are discarded), which are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 300 → 10 mmHg) and dried under high vacuum (23 °C, 1 mmHg, 1 h) to afford 16.7 g (92% from geraniol) of homogeranylbenzene as a colorless oil.
C. 1,4-Dimethylbicyclo[3.2.0]hept-3-en-6-one. A three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and an immersion thermometer, is charged with crude 3,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-6-heptenoic acid (29.40 g, 0.171 mol), acetic anhydride (185 mL) and potassium acetate (40.28 g, 0.410 mol). The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. During this time, an exotherm is observed (up to 50°C) followed by a slow return to room temperature, and the suspension becomes thicker. The reaction is brought to reflux (in ca. 20 min) by means of a heating mantle and stirring is continued for another 3.5 hr. A two-necked, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser and magnetic stirrer is charged with crushed ice (400 g) and water (100 g), and the hot mixture is added carefully with good stirring. Light petroleum ether (500 mL) is added and the mixture is stirred for 12 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is transferred into a 2-L separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with light petroleum ether (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (3 × 50 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (2 × 30 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at ambient pressure to give the crude product as a dark oil. Final purification is achieved by distillation under reduced pressure affording 17.70–18.86 g (76–81% yield) of a 99% pure mixture (97:3) of the keto olefin isomers as a colorless oil, bp 84–85°C/26–28 mm.
A dry, 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen (admitted through a hypodermic needle in the septum). A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. The flask is charged with 420 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and the solvent is cooled to −62°C in an acetone–dry ice bath. Tungsten hexachloride (60g, 0.15 mol) is then introduced. While the cold suspension is stirred, 31 mL (0.30 mol) of 90% butyllithium in hexane is added slowly from a hypodermic syringe. The rate of addition (complete in ca. 5 min) is such that the temperature remains below −15°C. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature with stirring. The green-brown viscous suspension becomes a dark-brown homogeneous solution that eventually turns green at room temperature. Because the reaction with the epoxide is exothermic, the flask is momentarily returned to the acetone–dry ice bath while 14.8 g (0.081 mol) of trans-cyclododecene oxide and is introduced with a hypodermic syringe. The cooling bath is again removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at room temperature. After 30 min the mixture is poured into 600 mL of an aqueous solution that is 1.5 M in sodium tartrate and 2 M in sodium hydroxide, and extracted with 240 mL of hexane. The organic phase is washed with a mixture of 160 mL of water and 80 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure affording 10.5–10.8 g (78–82%) of cyclododecene as a colorless liquid, bp 92–98°C (4.1 mm), 92% trans and 8% cis by analysis on a ¼-in. × 6-ft GLC column packed with 10% AgNO3 and 5% Carbowax 20 M on 80–100 mesh Chromosorb W at 110°C.
B. cis-1,5-Dimethylbicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dione. A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a heating mantle, reflux condenser, and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with 200 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid, 40 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 24 g (0.060 mol) of the tetraester from Section IIA. The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated at reflux for 3–6 hr. The solution is cooled in an ice bath and the product is isolated as described in Section IB above. The yield of c white to light yellow solid, mp 219–221°C, is 9.5–9.8 g (95–98%). Recrystallization from a minimum amount of hot ethanol affords 7.5–7.7 g (75–77%) of the diketone, mp 222–225°C, in one crop.
An analytical sample may be prepared by quick distillation (or Kugelrohr distillation) at 117–120°C (15 mm), but there is significant loss of material because of decomposition in the distillation pot. From 1 g of product, 0.72 g of pure material is obtained in this way, and recovery decreases as scale of distillation increases.
(C) Hydrolysis.—Optically pure l- and d-sec.-octyl alcohols are obtained by distillation in a current of steam of the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate and 2 moles of sodium hydroxide in 30 per cent solution. The alcohols are practically insoluble in water and are separated, dried with potassium carbonate, and distilled. Each boils at 86°/20 mm. and has a rotation [α]17°5461 + 11.8°, [α]17°D + 9.9° or [α]17°5461 − 11.8°, [α]17°D − 9.9°. The yields of alcohol from the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalates are about 95 per cent of the calculated amounts.
C. Ethyl 3-(4-cyanophenyl)propionate . A dry, 100-mL, three-necked flask, equipped with an argon inlet and a stirring bar, is charged with nickel acetylacetonate (Ni(acac)2, 520 mg, 2 mmol) and evacuated for 10 min before flushing with argon. THF (6.7 mL), N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP, 3.3 mL), 4-fluorostyrene (496 mg, 4 mmol) and ethyl 3-iodopropionate (4.56 g, 20 mmol) are successively added and the flask is equipped with an internal thermometer. The reaction mixture is cooled to −60°C before slowly adding the zinc reagent with a syringe through a large diameter cannula. After complete addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to −14°C in a cryostat. (The checkers used a dry ice/ethylene glycol bath). The conversion is complete within 12-15 hr, when it is quenched with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution (15 mL) and allowed to warm to room temperature. The quenched reaction mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (7 × 150 mL), the ethereal extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and evaporated to dryness by rotary evaporation at 40°C. The resulting yellow oil is purified by column chromatography affording 2.42 g (11.9 mmol) of ethyl 3-(4-cyanophenyl)propionate as a pale yellow oil (60%).
In the meantime, a sodium sulfite solution is prepared by dissolving 890 g. (20 moles) of sodium hydroxide, of about 90 per cent purity, in about 1 l. of water and then diluting to 6 l. A few drops of phenolphthalein solution are added and sulfur dioxide passed in, first until an acid reaction is indicated and then for two or three minutes longer. During the addition of the sulfur dioxide, the solution is cooled with running water. On account of the strong alkaline solution, the original color produced by the phenolphthalein is very faint, but this slowly increases until it becomes deep just before the acid point is reached. It is best to remove a small sample of the liquid from time to time, dilute with three or four volumes of water, and add a drop more of phenolphthalein.
A. 1,2:5,6-Di-O-isopropylidene-3-O-(S-methyldithiocarbonate)-α-D-glucofuranose. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen-inlet adapter, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and stopper is charged with 26.0 g (0.10 mol) of 1,2:5,6-di-O-isopropylidene-α-D-glucofuranose, 25 mg of imidazole, and 400 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen and a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained during the ensuing steps. Over a 5-min period, 7.2 g (0.150 mol) of a 50% sodium hydride dispersion is added. Vigorous gas evolution is observed. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min, 22.8 g (0.30 mol) of carbon disulfide is added all at once. Stirring is continued for 30 min, after which time 25.3 g (0.177 mol) of iodomethane is added in a single portion. The reaction mixture is stirred for another 15 min, and 5.0 mL of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise to destroy excess sodium hydride. The solution is filtered and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The semisolid residue is extracted with three 100-mL portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed with two 100-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and two 100-mL portions of water. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The product is dried further at 0.05 mm overnight. The resulting orange syrup is distilled (Kugelrohr) to give 32.2–33.0 g (92–94%) of product, bp 153–160°C (0.5–1.0 mm).
A. o-Carboxycinnamic acid. Eighty-eight grams (78 ml., 0.46 mole of peracid) of 40% peracetic acid is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask which is immersed in a water bath maintained at 25–30°. A 150-ml. dropping funnel is mounted so that the stem enters the flask to within about 4 cm. of the liquid surface. With mechanical stirring, a cold solution of 20 g. (0.14 mole) of β-naphthol in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise over a period of 4 hours to the peracid. With the appropriate rate of addition, the temperature of the reaction mixture slowly rises to 30–35° and should not exceed 40°. Solid material begins to separate from the orange solution when one-third or more of the naphthol solution is introduced. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour and the flask is allowed to stand in the water bath until the exothermic reaction ceases (usually 6–8 hours), then at room temperature for 4 days. The solid material is collected by suction filtration and washed on the filter with sufficient (10–20 ml.) acetic acid to remove colored impurities. Drying in the air gives 19.6–20.1 g. of crude o-carboxycinnamic acid as a pale yellow crystalline solid and.
The crystals which separate are collected on a suction funnel, washed as free from hydrochloric acid as possible with ice-cold distilled water, and dried. The mother liquor and washings are concentrated on a steam bath under reduced pressure until the separation of crystals causes bumping, when the solution is again allowed to crystallize. This procedure is repeated, the final mother liquor being evaporated nearly to dryness. The main product, together with that from the mother liquors, weighs 410–427 g. (91–95 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is sufficiently pure for conversion into o-sulfobenzoic anhydride (p. 495). In order to obtain a purer product the material may be recrystallized from an equal weight of distilled water; the yield on recrystallizing is about 90 per cent.
C. tert-Butyl N-(1-ethoxycyclopropyl)carbamate. A three-necked, cylindrical irradiation vessel is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a water-jacketed quartz immersion well, an inert gas-inlet, and a gas-exit tube connected to a bubbler. The vessel is charged with 6.26 g. (0.0493 mole) of redistilled 2-ethoxypyrrolin-5-one and 180 ml. of dry tert-butyl alcohol. The solution is stirred and degassed by bubbling nitrogen or argon through the gas-inlet tube for 15 minutes. The degassed solution is stirred and irradiated with ultraviolet light from a 450-watt, Hanovia, medium-pressure, mercury lamp filtered through a Vycor glass sleeve. During the irradiation an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon is maintained, and the lamp is cooled with warm water (35–40°) circulated through the cooling jacket of the immersion well. The progress of the irradiation is monitored by GC. When 90% of the 2-ethoxypyrrolin-5-one has reacted, the irradiation is stopped. The solution is transferred to a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an air-cooled reflux condenser mounted with a T-shaped nitrogen inlet. Nitrogen is passed through the apparatus for 30 minutes, after which the solution is stirred and heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 20 hours. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residual orange oil is refrigerated to induce crystallization. Sublimation of the solid at 35–40° (0.05 mm.) affords 5.5–6.3 g. (56–64%) of the carbamate as white needles, m.p. 38–40° and.
A. Chloromethyl phenyl sulfide . As described in ref. 3, a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar is charged with 120 mL of toluene and 18.9 g (0.63 mol) of paraformaldehyde. While the solution is stirred, 500 mL of concd hydrochloric acid is added to the suspension. The reaction mixture is heated to 50°C and the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 55.1 g (51.3 mL, 0.5 mol) of thiophenol in 120 mL of toluene . The thiophenol solution is added dropwise over 1 hr. The reaction mixture is stirred at 50°C for 1 hr and subsequently at room temperature for an additional 3 hr. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50-mL portions of toluene and the combined organic phase is washed with 100 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride solution. Most of the solvent is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure and the remaining crude product is purified by fractional distillation under reduced pressure using a Vigreux column (15-20 cm) to yield 57.9 g (73%) of chloromethyl phenyl sulfide as a colorless liquid, bp 106-107°C (11 mm).
B. 2-Methylthio-2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet connected to a nitrogen source, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The apparatus is maintained under a positive pressure of nitrogen and carefully protected from moisture throughout the ensuing reaction. The flask is charged with 37.2 g. (0.190 mole) of 2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane and 600 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and 0.228 mole of n-butyllithium in hexane is placed in the funnel. With stirring, the flask is cooled with a −20° bath, and the n-butyllithium solution is run into the flask over a 10-minute period. Stirring and cooling are continued for 2 hours, after which a solution of 32.2 g. (30.4 ml., 0.342 mole) of dimethyl disulfide in 50 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added over a 10-minute period. The cooling bath is then removed, and as the solution is stirred at room temperature a fine, white precipitate forms.
A. Trimethyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopropylidenorthoacetate. A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser is charged with 40.0 g (0.19 mol) of 1-chloro-1-(trichloroethenyl)cyclopropane, 120 g of potassium hydroxide, and 300 mL of methanol. The mixture is stirred for 16–18 hr in an oil bath at 85°C. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is diluted with 1 L of ice water. The mixture is then transferred to a 3-L separatory funnel and extracted with three 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ether phases are washed with three 150-mL portions of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed from the filtrate by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residue is distilled through a short-path column under water-aspirator vacuum to give 14.5–15.4 g (39–41%) of trimethyl 2-chloro-2-cyclopylidenorthoacetate bp 103–105°C (20 mm) and.
B. (4R)-(+)-Hydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 1.5 L of 0.05 M phosphate buffer and 18.8 g (134 mmol) of (4R)-(+)-acetoxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A 4.0-g lot of wheat germ lipase is added slowly with rapid stirring. Once the enzyme is dispersed, the speed of the stirrer is reduced and the flask is sealed with a glass stopper prior to being stirred at room temperature for 7 days. The stopper is removed and the contents of the flask are transferred to the body of a lighter than water continuous extraction apparatus whose pot is charged with 1 L of ethyl acetate. After extraction for 3 days, the ethyl acetate solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel using 30% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether (bp 35–60°C) as eluent. After recovery of 4.60 g (25%) of the less polar, unreacted acetoxy ketone, 7.80 g (60%) of the colorless, oily (R)-(+)-hydroxy ketone is obtained.
After drying in the air for a short time, the product is dried to constant weight at 105°. The yield of product melting at 163–164° is 170–180 g. (88–93 per cent of the theoretical amount). The acetic acid filtrate is distilled with a thermometer in the liquid until the temperature is 150°. The distillate amounts to about 120 cc. The residue is poured into the mortar and, after cooling, is ground with some of the ether used in washing the original crystals. Thus about 10 g. of a product melting at 160–163° is obtained.
A 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with Y-tube, magnetic stirrer, dropping funnel topped with gas bubbler, thermometer, and drying tube is charged with 14.7 g (40.6 mmol) of crude (R)-(−)-methyl 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl phosphate and 350 mL of dry toluene. The mixture is stirred under nitrogen and heated with a steam bath until dissolution occurs (44°C). The solution is then cooled in an ice–water bath to 10°C. The cooling bath is removed and a solution of 27.0 mL (91.8 mmol) of Red-Al in 35 mL of toluene is added from the dropping funnel over a 90-min period. The mixture turns yellow, evolves a gas, and heats up to 26°C. Gas evolution ceases 20 min after the addition is completed. TLC analysis (silica gel plate developed with ethyl acetate) indicates that the reaction is complete.
A 2-l. round-bottomed, short-necked flask is equipped with a glass mechanical stirrer. A suspension of 165 g. (0.5 mole) of o-chloromercuriphenol (p. 161) (m.p. 147° or higher) in 500 cc. of chloroform is placed in the flask and treated with 127 g. (0.5 mole) of iodine, the stirring being continued until a small sample on filtration shows no unreacted iodine. This requires from one to two hours. The solid inorganic mercury compounds are removed by suction filtration. The filtrate is distilled from a 1-l. distilling flask on the water bath to remove most of the chloroform, which is saved for later runs. The residual liquid is shaken vigorously with a solution of 5 g. of potassium iodide in 10 cc. of water, to remove dissolved mercuric iodide. The heavier layer, which still possesses a reddish color, is transferred without drying to a 200-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. At first a small amount of chloroform and water distils over, after which the higher-boiling material is collected in a separate receiver. Small amounts of inorganic mercury compounds remain in the flask.
A. 1-Phenyl-2,2,2-trichloroethanol. In a 1-l. round-bottomed-flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a powder funnel is placed a solution of 212 g. (2.00 moles) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde in 400 g. (270 ml., 3.35 moles) of chloroform. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and 123 g. of commercial powdered potassium hydroxide is added with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the solution does not exceed 45° (1–1.5 hours). The reaction mixture is stirred and kept at 40–50° for an additional hour and then poured into a solution of 60 ml. of sulfuric acid in 3 l. of water. The resulting two-phase mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with three 250-ml. portions of chloroform (a small amount of insoluble, black resinous material is discarded). The combined organic layers are washed with three 100-ml. portions of aqueous 10% sodium carbonate, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered into a 1-l. flask. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure on a hot water bath. The residue is transferred to a 250-ml. flask and distilled under reduced pressure to give 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloroethanol, b.p. 155–165° (26 mm.), 90–100° (0.5 mm.) and. The yield is 170–180 g. (38–40%).
Ten grams (0.082 mole) of benzoic acid is added to 100 ml. of anhydrous ethanol in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and with loose cotton plugs in the side necks. After the benzoic acid has dissolved, 600 ml. of liquid ammonia is added to the stirred solution. Then 6.2 g. (0.27 g. atom) of sodium is added in small pieces. When about one-third of the sodium has been added, the white sodium salt of the acid precipitates, and there is strong foaming of the reaction mixture. After all the sodium has been consumed, as evidenced by the disappearance of the blue color, 14.6 g. (0.27 mole) of ammonium chloride is added cautiously. The mixture is stirred for an additional hour and then allowed to stand until the ammonia has evaporated.
The flask now contains a brown mass covered with a film. The stopper is removed, and a test portion is taken out by means of a glass rod. The test portion is placed in a test tube or small beaker, treated with a little alcohol, and heated to boiling. When the reaction is complete, the material dissolves readily in the hot alcohol and crystallizes on cooling.
The flask is heated on a steam bath for 4 hours and then in an oil bath at 145° until all the crystals are dissolved. A mush of crystals separates when the mixture is cooled to room temperature. These are filtered on a Büchner funnel without any filtering medium. After the crystals are pressed dry, they are placed in 1.5 l. of cold water, washed thoroughly, filtered through paper, and dried in the air. The yield is 200–213 g. (60%), and the product melts at 205–207° (cor.) and.
B. (3E, 6E)-3,7,11-Trimethyl-1,3,6,10-dodecatetraene (α-farnesene). To the solution of (E)-(2-methyl-1,3-butadienyl)dimethylalane prepared above are added 17.25 g (100 mmol) of geranyl chloride and 1.15 g (1 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium dissolved in 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, while the reaction temperature is controlled below 25–30°C with a water bath. After the reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hr at room temperature, 250 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added at 0°C. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with pentane. The combined organic layer is washed with water, saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and water again. After the organic extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed thoroughly using a rotary evaporator (15–20 mm), and the crude product is passed through a short (15–20-cm) silica gel column (60–200 mesh) using hexane as an eluent. After the hexane is evaporated using a rotary evaporator, the residue is distilled using a 12-cm Vigreux column to give 16.70 g (83% based on geranyl chloride) of α-farnesene as a colorless liquid, bp 63–65° (0.05 mm).
F. (S)-(−)-1-Amino-2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine (SAMP). A 4-L, three-necked flask containing the crude urea is cooled to −5°C (internal temperature) by means of an ice–salt bath and treated with a chilled (−5°C) solution of 168 g of potassium hydroxide in 150 mL of water. After addition of 685 mL (1.3 mol) of 1.9 N potassium hypochlorite solution, precooled to −5°C, the temperature rises within 10 min to 30–40°C and the cooling bath is removed after the mixture reaches room temperature. Stirring is continued for a total of 12–15 hr. Excess potassium hypochlorite is destroyed with a freshly prepared solution of sodium bisulfite (20 g NaHSO3 in 50 mL of H2O) and the mixture is acidified (pH 2) with a minimum amount of 12 N hydrochloric acid (ca. 350 mL) under ice cooling. A strong evolution of carbon dioxide occurs. The mixture is allowed to stir for an additional 15 min at ambient temperature, made alkaline (pH 9) with ca. 100 mL of aqueous 50% potassium hydroxide, and saturated with potassium carbonate (500 g). Precipitated potassium salts are filtered off by suction through a large Büchner funnel and washed twice with ethanol; the filtrate is extracted with a 1 : 1 chloroform/ethanol mixture (1 × 800 mL and 2 × 400 mL). During extraction salt precipitation again occurs and the salts should be filtered off as mentioned above. The organic layers are collected, concentrated under reduced pressure at 30°C, taken up in 500 mL of chloroform, and dried twice over sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration through Celite and the solvent is stripped off as mentioned above to give 80–90 g of a dark oil. Immediate distillation through a 40-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column (the receiver should be cooled with ice to prevent loss of substance) yields a small forerun containing 2-methoxymethylpyrrolidine, followed by SAMP as a colorless liquid, bp 42°C at 1.8 mm (80°C bath temperature), [α]D20 −79.6° (neat). Overall yields of SAMP range from 65 to 75 g (50–58%). A purity of ca. 95% was established by GLC analysis. The optical antipode RAMP, [α]D20 + 79.8° (neat), can be prepared likewise, starting from (R)-proline.
(B) Hydrolysis of Ethyl Benzoylacetoacetate.—Thirty-two grams (0.6 mole) of ammonium chloride is dissolved in 150 cc. (8.3 moles) of water in a 500-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, and 10 cc. (0.15 mole) of ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) is added. The solution is warmed to 42°, 58.5 g. (0.25 mole) of ethyl benzoylacetoacetate at 20° is added quickly, and the mixture is shaken. The flask is placed in a water bath at 42° for exactly ten minutes and then cooled rapidly by placing it in an ice bath. The solution is extracted twice with 100-cc. portions of ether, and the ether solution is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is distilled, and the residue distilled in vacuo; the yield is 37.0–37.5 g. (77–78 per cent of the theoretical amount) of ethyl benzoylacetate boiling at 132–137°/4 mm., or 165–169°/20 mm.
B. β-Carbomethoxypropionyl chloride. In a 1-l. flask bearing a reflux condenser are placed 264 g. (2 moles) of methyl hydrogen succinate and 290 ml. (4 moles) of thionyl chloride, and the solution is warmed in a bath at 30–40° for 3 hours. The condenser is replaced by a modified Claisen still head, the excess thionyl chloride is removed on a steam bath under reduced pressure, and the β-carbomethoxypropionyl chloride is distilled and. The yield of colorless product is 270–278 g. (90–93%), b.p. 92–93°/18 mm. and.
A solution of 25 g. (0.125 mole) of pyrene in 100 ml. of dimethylformamide and is treated with a 50% excess of ozone. The solution of the ozonide is added at a moderate rate, with stirring, to 500 ml. of 1% aqueous acetic acid. The suspension is allowed to stand overnight, and the resulting solid is collected by filtration and washed with water.
In the container A (Fig. 30) is placed 1500 g. of crushed nutmegs moistened with ether. A is a 3-l. inverted aspirator bottle connected by a 3-mm. glass tube to the efficient condenser C, and by 3-mm. tubing, one end of which is provided with a Soxhlet thimble to the 2-l. round-bottomed flask B. Flask B is connected by 3-mm. tubing of 75-cm. length to C. In B are placed 500 cc. of ether and a few chips of clay plate to prevent superheating. B is then heated on a steam cone so that the ether boils rapidly enough to reach the condenser C and to flow back through A.
One hundred grams (1 mole) of succinic anhydride and 116 g. (1 mole) of dimethylglyoxime, both finely ground, are intimately mixed and introduced into a 1-l. three-necked flask which is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask, and an outlet tube connected to a water-cooled condenser arranged for distillation. The mixture is heated slowly with an electric mantle or oil bath, and stirring is commenced as soon as practicable. The mixture liquefies at about 100°, and a rapid reaction begins at 150–170° accompanied by a sudden rise in temperature. This initial rapid reaction can be controlled readily by removing the heater when the temperature reaches 170° and applying a cooling bath until the inside temperature is 150°. Heat is then applied again, and distillation of the product begins at a flask temperature of 160° and continues until the temperature reaches 200°. The stirrer is stopped, the receiver is changed, and, after the flask and contents have cooled to about 120°, 50 ml. of water is added. The thermometer is replaced by an inlet tube, and steam is passed in until no more insoluble material passes over. Usually collection of about 200–300 ml. of distillate is sufficient. The distillate is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the extracts are combined with the dimethylfurazan obtained by direct distillation. The ether solution is dried for a short time over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is evaporated on a steam bath. The residue is distilled at atmospheric pressure through a short column, and after a fore-run, consisting chiefly of biacetyl, the dimethylfurazan distils at 154–159° as a colorless liquid, nD25 1.4234–1.4243, m.p. −7.2 to −6.6°. The yield is 59–63 g. (60–64%).
To the thick, syrupy residue is added 200 ml. of benzene, and, after the solution is cooled in an ice bath and the condenser is set for reflux, 350 ml. of water is slowly added through the separatory funnel, with stirring. This is followed by the cautious addition of 325 ml. of a 20% solution of hydrochloric acid, and stirring is continued untill all the precipitate dissolves. The organic layer is then separated, and the aqueous layer and flask are washed with 50 ml. benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed successively with water, a 5% solution of sodium carbonate, and again with water. Concentration of the benzene solution gives 88.5 g. of an oily residue. Careful fractional distillation of this residue gives, after a fore-run, 53.0 g. (57%) of the pure 2-methyl-2,5-decanediol boiling at 65–69°/2 mm., n25D 1.4420.
In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask, a mixture of 160 g. (0.96 mole) of veratraldehyde, 192 g. (1.07 moles) of powdered, dry hippuric acid (p. 328), 80 g. (0.98 mole) of powdered, freshly fused sodium acetate, and 300 g. (278 cc., 2.9 moles) of high-grade acetic anhydride is heated on an electric hot plate, with constant shaking. The mixture becomes almost solid, and then, as the temperature rises, it gradually liquefies and turns deep yellow in color. As soon as the material has liquefied completely the flask is transferred to a steam bath and heated for two hours. During this time a part of the product separates as deep yellow crystals. At the end of the heating 400 cc. of alcohol is added slowly to the contents of the flask. During this addition the flask is cooled slightly to moderate the vigor of the reaction. After allowing the reaction mixture to stand overnight, the yellow crystalline product is filtered with suction and washed on the filter with two 100-cc. portions of ice-cold alcohol and finally with two 100-cc. portions of boiling water. After drying, the product weighs 205–215 g. (69–73 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 149–150°. This material is sufficiently pure for many purposes; it can be purified further by crystallization from hot benzene. In this way, using 1.2 l. of benzene, there is obtained 180–190 g. of the pure azlactone, melting at 151–152°.
Into a 5-l. flask or bottle, set in a water bath and fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, and separatory funnel, are placed 208 g. (1 mole) of benzalacetophenone, 3.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and 60 g. (1 mole) of glacial acetic acid. The mixture is warmed with stirring to 35°, and a solution of 130 g. (2 moles) of potassium cyanide in 375 cc. of water is added from the separatory funnel over a period of about fifteen minutes. The initial greenish color changes to yellow after all the acetic acid has reacted and the solution has become alkaline. Stirring is continued for three hours, the temperature being maintained at 35°. During this time about half of the nitrile crystallizes. The flask is then loosely stoppered and left in a cool place for about fifty hours (conveniently out-of-doors in cold weather, but out of direct sunlight), after which the solid is filtered and washed, first with 500 cc. of cold 50 per cent alcohol, and then with water until free from potassium cyanide (silver nitrate test). The yield of air-dried material melting at 125° is 220–227 g. (93–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is sufficiently pure for most purposes, although it contains traces of a high-melting substance. If a product of higher melting point is desired, it may be recrystallized from 1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol or 375 cc. of acetone. Pure phenylbenzoylpropionitrile melts at 127°.
B. 6,6-Dimethyl-5,7-dioxaspiro[2.5]octane-4,8-dione (2). A suspension of 39.0 g (0.30 mol) of 1 and 33.0 g (0.33 mol) of freshly distilled isopropenyl acetate is stirred vigorously (magnetic stirrer). To this suspension is added dropwise over a period of 30 min, 0.5 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid. While being stirred for an additional 30 min, the solution became clear yellow, and then partly solidified after being kept at 5°C for 24 hr. After addition of 50 mL of cold water, the precipitated solid is filtered, washed with 10 mL of cold water, and air-dried to give 30.9 g of crude spiroacylal 2. The filtrate is extracted three times with 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are carefully washed with 50 mL of brine, dried (MgSO4), and decolorized with activated carbon. Evaporation of the solvent gave an additional 7.8 g of spiroacylal 2 as a yellow solid. The combined samples of crude spiroacylal (38.7 g) are recrystallized from 110 mL of hexane and 25 mL of benzene to give 28.7–31.5 g (55–61%) of 2 as colorless needles, mp 65–67°C. Concentration of the above mother liquor to ca. 40 mL gave 0.80 g of a second crop of spiroacylal 2 as slightly yellow crystals, mp 58–60°C.
The crude trinitrobenzoic acid obtained by oxidation of 360 g. (1.6 moles) of trinitrotoluene (p. 543) is mixed with 2 l. of water at 35° in a 5-l. flask provided with a stirrer. Fifteen per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added, with continuous stirring, until a faint red color is just produced. The color is then immediately discharged by means of one or two drops of acetic acid, and the liquid is filtered from unchanged trinitrotoluene. The filtrate is transferred to a 5-l. flask, and 70 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added.
The condenser is removed, the thermometer replaced by a dropping funnel, and 40 g. (0.8 mole) of 100 per cent hydrazine hydrate added, with stirring, in the course of ten to fifteen minutes. After being stirred for forty-five minutes longer, the solution is cooled slightly, and, unless crystallization of the reaction product starts spontaneously, the walls of the vessel are scratched with a glass rod to induce crystallization. The product separates in fine, colorless needles. After being thoroughly cooled in an ice bath, the highly hygroscopic salt is collected quickly on a Büchner funnel, washed with 150 cc. of cold absolute alcohol, and pressed dry under a rubber dam. Dried in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid, this material weighs 100–108 g. A further crop can be obtained after distilling 200–300 cc. of solvent from the mother liquor and washings at the pressure of the water pump. The total yield of salt, m.p. 175–180°, with decomposition, is 112–120 g. (83.5–89.5 per cent of the theoretical amount),, and.
A 250-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet, and outlet stopcocks is charged with 60 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide and 6.01 g. (0.100 mole) of ethylenediamine. The outlet stopcock is connected to a trap containing mercury or Nujol, and the third neck of the flask is fitted with a rubber septum. While the solution in the flask is stirred, the system is flushed with nitrogen for 30 minutes; a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel during the remainder of the reaction. An aqueous solution containing 0.03 mole of chromium(II) perchlorate is added to the reaction vessel with a hypodermic syringe, forming a purple solution of the chromium(II)-en complex. To this solution is added, with a hypodermic syringe, a solution of 1.66 g. (0.00802 mole) of 1-bromonaphthalene in 20 ml. of oxygen-free N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction solution is stirred for 70 minutes, during which time the color changes from purple to deep red, and poured into a solution of 40 g. of ammonium sulfate in 400 ml. of 0.4 M hydrochloric acid. The resulting emulsion is extracted with five 60-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with two 25-ml. portions of water, dried over potassium carbonate, and concentrated. The residue crystallizes, yielding 0.96–1.00 g. (93–98%) of naphthalene, m.p. 77–80°. Recrystallization from ethanol affords pure naphthalene as white plates, m.p. 80–81°.
C. 2-(4-Cyano-phenyl)-1-[2-(3,4- dimethoxyphenyl)- ethyl]-1 H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (6). A 50-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask with 10/14 ground glass joints is equipped with an oval-shaped magnetic stir bar, a thermometer adapter and an alcohol thermometer. The flask is charged with diamine 4 (5.00 g, 14.5 mmol), 4-cyanobenzaldehyde 5 (2.10 g, 16.0 mmol, 1.10 equiv), DMF (30 mL) and de-ionized water (1 mL). The resulting dark brown homogeneous mixture is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 °C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Oxone(r) (5.80 g, 9.44 mmol, 0.65 equiv) is added in one portion and the resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred while immersed in the ice-water bath. After addition of Oxone(r), the following observations are made: the internal temperature of the mixture rises to ca. 6-8 °C and stays at this temperature for about 1 h; the granular Oxone(r) slowly loses its consistency and the mixture becomes a loose, easily stirred light brown slurry. After a period of 2 h, HPLC analysis indicates the disappearance of compound 4. The stirred mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is then transferred in small portions using a Pasteur pipette over ca. 15 min to a vigorously stirred solution of potassium carbonate (2.76 g, 20 mmol) in water (450 mL). During the addition, the desired benzimidazole product 6 precipitates as a light brown-beige solid. The resulting slurry is stirred for an additional hour, then the solids are collected by suction filtration on a filter paper using a ceramic Büchner funnel. The damp filter cake is allowed to partially air-dry overnight under suction in the filter funnel and is then collected and placed under vacuum (0.03 mmHg) at ambient temperature until constant mass is achieved to provide 5.88-6.04 g (89-91% yield) of a light tan solid and). The material was further purified by dissolving the crude product in dichloromethane (250 mL), washing with diluted sodium hydroxide solution (1.0 M, 3 x 100 mL), then washing with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer was dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered over a filter paper and solvents removed on the rotary evaporator. The residue was dried in vacuo (0.03 mmHg) for 48 h to provide 4.9 g (74% yield) of a beige solid.
To 500 ml. of absolute methanol in a 1-l. electrolytic (tall form) beaker is added 1.1 g. (0.05 g. atom) of clean sodium metal. After solution of the sodium, 216 g. (1.0 mole) of methyl hydrogen sebacate is dissolved in the sodium methoxide solution. A magnetic stirring bar is placed in the beaker which is then fitted with a large neoprene stopper holding a platinum sheet anode, 12 cm.2 in area; and two platinum sheet cathodes, approximately 5.3 cm.2 in area, spaced equidistantly on either side of the anode at a distance of approximately 1.5 cm.. The stopper is also provided with a stoppered entry tube and an efficient reflux condenser.
C. Beckmann fission of 2-methoxycyclooctanone oxime. In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a calcium chloride tube is placed a suspension of 62.5 g. (0.30 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride in 150 ml. of absolute ether, and the reaction vessel is cooled with ice. A solution of 42.8 g. of crude 2-methoxycyclooctanone oxime (0.25 mole) in 100 ml. of absolute ether is added over 30 minutes with vigorous stirring and the reaction is continued for 50 minutes at 5°. The reaction mixture, which becomes a transparent reddish brown solution, is poured with mechanical stirring into 500 g. of ice in a 2-l. beaker. Stirring is continued for 1.5 hours at 5°. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride three times. The combined organic extracts are neutralized with dilute sodium carbonate solution and dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent below 40° affords a reddish brown oil which is distilled to give 29.6 g. (85.2%) of 7-cyanoheptanal, b.p. 109–115° (0.3 mm.) n26D = 1.4456. The 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone has m.p. 74–75° after recrystallization from ethanol.
The yield of ester boiling at 76–80°/18 mm. is 105–110 g. (28–29 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the ethyl acetate).
A. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 61 g. (0.5 mole) of benzoic acid and 300 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). To this mixture is added 100 ml. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.54) in portions of 2 or 3 ml. The temperature during the addition of the acid is kept between 70° and 90° by means of external cooling with cold water, and the addition should be carried out in a good hood. The flask is covered with a watch glass and allowed to stand for an hour, or overnight, in the hood. The flask is then heated on a steam bath in the hood for 4 hours, during which time considerable amounts of brown fumes are evolved. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon yellow crystals separate from the solution. An additional 75 ml. of fuming nitric acid is added, and the mixture is heated on the steam bath for 3 hours and then in an oil bath at 135–145° for 3 hours (hood). Brown fumes are evolved continuously, especially during the heating in the oil bath. The color of the reaction mixture is light to reddish yellow.
A. Diels–Alder-adduct rac-3.2 A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a calcium-sulfate-filled drying tube, a nitrogen inlet, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 2,2-diamethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione 2 (Meldrum's acid) ((Note 1), 10.0 g, 69.4 mmol), a catalytic amount of ethylenediammonium diacetate (EDDA) ((Note 2), 500 mg, 2.77 mmol) and dry methanol (150 mL). (R,S)-Citronellal (rac-1, Sigma; dried over MgSO4 and distilled) ((Note 3), 9.74 g = 11.4 mL, 63.1 mmol) is added under nitrogen over 15 min through the dropping funnel to the well-stirred mixture while the temperature is kept at 15–20°C by cooling the flask with a water bath. The solution is stirred for an additional 45 min at room temperature, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (25°C), and the remaining yellow oil is dissolved in diethyl ether (300 mL). The organic layer is washed with water (50 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 × 50 mL) and brine (50 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration and removal of the solvent gives an 8 : 1 mixture (16.5 g) of the Diels–Alder adduct rac-3 and the ene-product rac-4 as a yellow oil.
A 6-L Erlenmeyer flask which contains a large magnetic stirring bar is charged with 294 g (2 mol) of L-glutamic acid and 2 L of distilled water. The suspension is stirred vigorously while solutions of 168 g (2.4 mol) of sodium nitrite in 1.2 L of water and 1.2 L of aqueous 2 N sulfuric acid are added simultaneously from separatory funnels. After the addition is complete, the solution is stirred at room temperature for an additional 15 hr. The water is then removed by heating below 50°C under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The resulting pasty solid is triturated with 500 mL of boiling acetone and the hot solution is filtered and set aside to cool. This operation is repeated four times and. Removal of solvent with a rotary evaporator affords 312 g of crude (+)-γ-butyrolactone-γ-carboxylic acid as a slightly yellow oil and.
The product is purified by recrystallization from 500 cc. of methyl alcohol containing 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The first crop of crystals amounts to 60 g. and melts at 103–104°. The mother liquors are concentrated to 150 cc., and a second crop weighing 12–13 g. is collected. The total yield of recrystallized material is 72–73 g. (88–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Part of the excess hydrogen chloride is removed by blowing (or drawing) air through the solution for 1 hour. The solution then is made alkaline by the slow addition of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide. with mechanical stirring and cooling in an ice bath. Solid sodium hydroxide (24 g.) is added, and the mixture is steam-distilled until no more ammonia and acetophenone pass into the distillate. About 3–4 l. of distillate is collected.
B. (S)-(−)-1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol. In a 12-L, round-bottomed flask the above ether solution is diluted to 4 L with additional ethyl ether. A 5.0-mL aliquot of this solution is used to assay the enzyme. The remaining ether solution is stirred using an overhead stirrer with 4 L of aqueous 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) containing 60 g of crude sodium taurocholate. An opaque emulsion forms. The reaction is started by adding 2000 units of cholesterol esterase activity (100–150 g of bovine pancreas acetone powder,). Stirring is continued at ~25°C and the flask is stoppered to minimize evaporation of ether. The pH of the emulsion is measured occasionally and readjusted to 7.2 ± 0.3 by adding aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide. Approximately 250 mL of base is consumed during the first 3 hr; an additional 400 mL is consumed over the next 20 hr. Although the consumption of base virtually ceases after 24 hr, stirring is continued for a total of 3 days.
To a saturated solution of 5.5 g. (0.028 mole) of finely powdered cupric acetate monohydrate in 20 ml. of a 1:1 by volume pyridine-methanol mixture,,, and contained in a 50-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser is added 2.0 g. (0.0196 mole) of phenylacetylene. The deep-blue suspension becomes green when heated under reflux. After 1 hour of heating, the solution is cooled and added dropwise to 60 ml. of 18N sulfuric acid, with stirring and external cooling in an ice-salt freezing mixture. The resulting white suspension is extracted with three 25-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ethereal extracts are washed with 15 ml. of aqueous ethanolic silver nitrate solution to remove any unchanged phenylacetylene. The ether solution is then washed twice with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. When the dried ether solution is concentrated under reduced pressure, a brown oil (1.81 g.) remains which solidifies on cooling.
A. Tris(dimethylamino)borane. A 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and a dry ice-cooled reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 800 mL of pentane and 218 g (4.84 mol) of dimethylamine, and cooled to ca. −30°C with a dry ice-methanol bath. A solution of 201 g (0.801 mol) of boron tribromide in 400 mL of pentane is added dropwise through the addition funnel over 3 hr to the vigorously stirred solution while maintaining the bath-temperature at −20°C to −10°C. As soon as the addition is begun, a white precipitate of dimethylamine hydrobromide appears. The temperature is allowed to rise to ambient temperature without removing the cooling bath, and the slurry is stirred for 16 hr at room temperature. The precipitate is removed by filtration through a Celite pad on a glass-fritted filter funnel. The flask and filter cake are rinsed three times with 60 mL of pentane . The pentane solution is distilled to give 92.7 g (81%) of tris(dimethylamino)borane as a colorless liquid, bp 44-45°C (12 mm), lit.2 bp 39°C (10 mm),.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-mL dropping funnel, a nitrogen-inlet tube, a mechanical stirrer, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 172 g (0.75 mol) of 1,2-bis(trimethylsiloxy) cyclobutene and 375 mL of anhydrous pentane. A dry nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the system and the solution is cooled to −60°C by means of a dry ice-methanol bath. Then a solution of 120 g (0.75 mol) of bromine and 375 mL of anhydrous pentane is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 2 hr. When the addition is complete, the mixture must be heated to 40°C for 2 hr and concentrated by removing ca. 550 mL of solvent under reduced pressure (15 mm) at room temperature. To isolate the dione the residue is cooled to −60°C by immersion of the flask in a dry ice–methanol bath. The crystallized product is quickly filtered through a hermetically sealed, 250-mL sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3), a dry nitrogen pressure being used to push down solvent. The yellow solid is washed with stirring with eight 25-mL portions of anhydrous pentane cooled to −60°C and sucked as dry as possible on the filter. The pentane used in the washing is concentrated under reduced pressure (15 mm) at room temperature to ca. 15 mL, then the flask is again cooled to −60°C. The crystallized product is washed with four 15-mL portions of anhydrous pentane cooled to −60°C as before. The two batches of crystals are of approximately equal purity. The yield of 1,2-cyclobutanedione is 42–46 g (70–73%), mp 65°C.
The filtrates are best neutralized separately. Two 5-gal. crocks are half filled with crushed ice, and one-half of the total filtrate is poured into each. For neutralization, commercial 12N ammonium hydroxide is added slowly with stirring; a total of 4.8 l. is required. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with water, and air-dried.
The solution in the flask is distilled over a free flame until separation of salt prevents further heating. It is then transferred to a large evaporating dish, placed on a steam bath and evaporated to dryness.
(C) Duroquinone.—A suspension of 100 g. of the tin compound in a solution of 300 g. of ferric chloride crystals in a mixture of 150 cc. of water and 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is allowed to stand overnight at about 30°, and is then filtered. The product is dissolved in 150 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The solution is filtered and allowed to stand overnight at 30°. The yield is 40 g. of duroquinone (90 per cent of the theoretical amount) melting at 109–110°.
C. 2,3-Dicyano-1,4,4a,9a-tetrahydrofluorene (3). A 100-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser under nitrogen pressure is charged with 10.4 g. (0.100 mole) of crude cyclobutene 2, 23.3 g. (0.201 mole) of indene, and 0.3 g. of hydroquinone. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at 150° for 4 hours under nitrogen. The reflux condenser is replaced by a still head, and 6.3 g. (0.053 mole) of indene is distilled from the flask at a bath temperature of about 95° (11 mm.). The dark-colored reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, diluted with 200 ml. of benzene followed by 1 g. of decolorizing carbon, and the resulting mixture is refluxed for 2 hours. After the mixture is cooled to room temperature, the carbon is removed by filtration, and the benzene is distilled. The residual oily residue solidifies on standing and is recrystallized from 45 ml. of ethanol, yielding 15.4–15.9 g. (70–72%) of crystalline fluorene 3, m.p. 98.5–100°.
Dicyclohexylboron trifluoromethanesulfonate. 2 An oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a stir bar and capped with a rubber septum is charged with cyclohexene (33.4 mL, 0.33 mol) and dry diethyl ether (100 mL), and kept at 0°C under nitrogen. Borane-dimethyl sulfide complex (16.6 mL, 0.16 mol) is added dropwise during 30 min with stirring. The reaction mixture is stirred for 3 hr at 0°C, then the solid is allowed to settle without stirring. The supernatant organic solution is removed as much as possible by syringe, and the residual solid is dried under reduced pressure to give dicyclohexylborane (26.3-28.3 g, 92-99% yield), which is used without purification for the preparation of the triflate.
The ice-cold fluoboric acid solution is added rather rapidly, with stirring, to the finished tetrazo solution, the temperature being kept below 10°. A thick paste of 4,4'-biphenylene-bis-diazonium borofluoride forms. The mixture is stirred at 10° for twenty to thirty minutes. It is then collected on a 19-cm. Büchner funnel and washed consecutively with about 200 cc. of cold water, 200 cc. of cold commercial methyl alcohol, and 200 cc. of commercial ether; the cake is sucked as dry as possible between washings. It is then dried in a vacuum desiccator over concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The yield of the dry solid is 393–400 g. (68–69 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product decomposes at 135–137°.
To the flask is added 250 ml. of a 2.5% solution of sodium hydroxide and a cuprous oxide-silver oxide catalyst. In the two dropping funnels are placed, respectively, 96 g. (1.0 mole) of furfural and a solution of 40 g. (1.0 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water. The contents of the flask are heated to about 55°, vigorous stirring is started, and a rapid stream of oxygen is bubbled through as the contents of the two funnels are added simultaneously to the reaction mixture at such a rate (20–25 min.) as to maintain the temperature at 50–55° without external heating. After the additions have been completed, vigorous stirring and passage of oxygen are continued until the temperature drops below 40° (15–30 min., depending on the rate of oxygen flow).
The dropping funnel is removed, and 67.4 g. (0.8 mole) of dihydropyran and 600 ml. of dry, olefin-free pentane are added successively. The light-yellow solution is stirred for 15 minutes in an ice-water bath, and then 164.8 g. (0.86 mole) of ethyl trichloracetate is added from the dropping funnel over a period of 3–4 minutes. The dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a calcium chloride tube.
D. (S)-4-Triisopropylsilyl-3-butyn-2-ol (4). A one-necked, flame-dried, 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum fitted with an argon inlet needle is flushed with argon. Isopropyl alcohol (250 mL) and 4-triisopropylsilyl-3-butyn-2-one (2) (5.1 g, 22.7 mmol) are added to the flask through the septum by syringe. The ruthenium catalyst 3 (180 mg, 0.3 mmol) is taken up in a minimal amount of CH2Cl2 (~5 mL) and added to the reaction mixture in one portion by means of a syringe. The mixture is stirred for 1.5 h and then the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator (40 °C, water aspirator pressure). The brown residue is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (95 °C, 0.2 mmHg; Note 4) to yield the alcohol 4 (5.0 g, 85% for three steps) as a clear oil.
Five hundred grams (2.5 moles) of dry, powdered benzanilide (p. 82), 1025 g. (8.5 moles) of technical dimethylaniline, and 525 g. (307 cc., 3.4 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride are mixed in a 3-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask. The flask is fitted with a two-holed cork stopper which carries a reflux condenser and a thermometer. The top of the condenser is provided with a calcium chloride tube; the bulb of the thermometer reaches beneath the surface of the liquid.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stopper holding a reflux condenser and a separatory funnel are placed 294 g. (6 moles) of sodium cyanide and 300 cc. of water. The flask is heated on a steam bath until most of the sodium cyanide is in solution. This requires two to three hours. A solution of 500 g. (2.47 moles) of trimethylene bromide in 1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol is then added through the separatory funnel over a period of forty to sixty minutes. The mixture is refluxed for thirty to forty hours on a steam bath. Then the solvent is removed, preferably under reduced pressure, using an oil bath.
The reaction mixture is poured onto about 400 g. of cracked ice and is made acidic with 20% sulfuric acid. After two clear phases have formed the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, and the lower layer is removed. This aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene and discarded. The three organic extracts are washed separately and successively with 125 ml. of water and 125 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, then filtered successively through a layer of anhydrous sodium sulfate.
A 1-L Hastelloy C-276 shaker tube fitted with a temperature sensor, a rupture-disk safety device, and a gas inlet valve attached to an ethylene cylinder is charged with 120.0 g (0.675 mol) of freshly distilled tetrachlorocyclopropene, 350 mL of dry tetrachloroethylene, and 10 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate. The tube is pressurized to 20 atm with ethylene and shaken for 3 hr. The ethylene cylinder is disconnected, and the pressure vessel is gradually heated to 170°C over a 30-min period and is shaken at this temperature for 19.5 hr. The vessel is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the excess ethylene is slowly released and bubbled through a wash bottle containing methylene chloride. The light-brown liquid in the shaker tube is decanted and the remaining solid washed twice with 50 mL of methylene chloride. The organic phases are combined and the methylene chloride is removed by distillation. The residual liquid is distilled at water-aspirator vacuum through a 40-cm Vigreux column. The solvent tetrachloroethylene, bp 35°C (27 mm), is collected, followed by 104.1–105.6 g (75–76%) of 1-chloro-1-(trichloroethenyl)cyclopropane as a colorless liquid, bp 81–83°C (27 mm).
A mixture of 45.6 g. (0.2 mole) of benzilic acid in 700 ml. of anhydrous thiophene-free benzene, contained in a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser (attached to a calcium chloride drying tube) and a motor-driven sealed stirrer, is cooled in an ice bath until a crystalline mass results. To the stirred mixture is added, in one portion, 80 g. (0.6 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The stirred mixture is heated until refluxing begins and is maintained at this temperature for 3 hours. During this period much hydrogen chloride is evolved, and the initially yellow solution soon becomes deep red. The solution is cooled and decomposed by the cautious addition of small pieces of ice, and then 400 ml. of water is added cautiously, followed by 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene is removed by steam distillation, and the product is separated by filtration from the hot mixture. The lumps of product are crushed and extracted with 400 ml. of boiling 10% sodium carbonate solution. The mixture is filtered, and the extraction is repeated on the undissolved residue with an additional 200 ml. of hot 10% sodium carbonate solution. The basic filtrates are combined, 3–4 g. of Norit is added, and the mixture is heated to boiling. The Norit is separated by filtration, and the cooled solution is strongly acidified with cold concentrated hydrochloric acid. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, and dried. The 9-fluorenecarboxylic acid so obtained weighs 39–41 g. (93–97%) and melts at 215–222°.
After cooling, the product is filtered by suction, washed with four 500-ml. portions of water and two 250-ml. portions of methanol, and air-dried. The yield of 4-methylcarbostyril is 138–144 g. (86–91%). This material, which melts at 219–221°, is suitable for preparing 2-chlorolepidine (p. 194). It may be purified further by recrystallization from 95% ethanol. For recrystallization 39 g. is dissolved in 650 ml. of solvent; the recovery is 33–33.5 g., and the melting point of the product is 222–224°.
B. 2,2-Diphenylcyclopentanone. To a 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and wide inner-spiral reflux condenser is added 57.5 g (0.22 mol) of the enaminonitrile from step A and 800 mL of concd hydrochloric acid (HCl,). The mixture is stirred for 5 min, and 800 mL of water is added. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux (heating mantle, 110°C internal temperature) with vigorous stirring for 4 days,,. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 5 × 200 mL). The organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, 100 mL) and brine (100 mL), and the aqueous layers are back-extracted with dichloromethane (100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is recrystallized from MTBE (300 mL). The mother liquor is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and purified by column chromatography on silica gel (250 g) eluting with hexane/EtOAc (4/1), decolorized with carbon, and recrystallized from MTBE to afford a combined yield of 48.2 g (92%,) of the ketone as a white solid,).
A. (S)-( + )-Propane-1,2-diol. Into a three-necked, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel and reflux condenser are placed 10.8 g (0.284 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride and 200 mL of dry ethyl ether. To this slurry is added, from the dropping funnel, 33 g (0.28 mol) of ethyl L-( − )-lactate in 150 mL of dry ethyl ether at a rate that maintains a steady reflux. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 3 hr. Then 25 mL (1.39 mol) of water is carefully added and stirring is continued for a further 1.5 hr. The mixture is filtered and the white solid (LiOH) is washed well with ether and dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to give a portion of the crude product (3 g). Aqueous 1 M sulfuric acid is added to the solid until the milky suspension is just acidic (pH 6–6.5). The suspension is subjected to continuous extraction with twice its volume of dichloromethane (about 500 mL) for 168 hr. The dichloromethane layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The crude products are combined and distilled at reduced pressure to obtain 14.4–15.6 g (68–73%) of (S)-( + )-propane-1,2-diol, bp 52–56°C (0.5 mm), as a colorless liquid.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 218 g. (1 mole) of p-hydroxyphenylarsonic acid and 375 cc. of water. A solution of 180 g. (4.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 375 cc. of water is added, and the mixture shaken until a homogeneous solution is obtained. After cooling to 40–50° there is added 189 g. (2 moles) of chloroacetic acid in small portions with stirring, and the clear solution is refluxed for four hours. At the end of this time the mixture is cooled to 20°, filtered to remove a slight flocculent precipitate, and the p-arsonophenoxyacetic acid precipitated by the addition of 200 cc. (2.1 moles) of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19).
The mixture is heated to 45°, and with good stirring hydrogen sulfide is passed into the reaction mixture while its temperature is maintained between 45° and 55° and. The yellow suspended particles of 2,4-dinitroaniline dissolve slowly to form an intensely red-colored solution. The reaction is complete when all the yellow particles have disappeared; reduction should be complete in 30–60 minutes.
The flask containing the crude pyridinium salt is removed from the condenser, and the salt is dissolved by adding 400 cc. of water. The flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer which will stir efficiently any volume of liquid which may be in the flask, and the solution is cooled to 0° in an ice-salt bath. Separate solutions of 1.2 kg. (3.65 moles) of potassium ferricyanide in 2.4 l. of water and of 300 g. (7.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water are prepared and added dropwise from two separatory funnels to the well-stirred solution of the pyridinium salt at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 10°. The rate of addition of these two solutions is regulated so that all the sodium hydroxide solution has been introduced into the reaction mixture when one-half of the potassium ferricyanide solution has been added. This usually requires about one hour. The remaining half of the potassium ferricyanide is then added during another hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand five hours, during which time it comes to room temperature.
A 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a rubber septum pierced by an argon inlet needle and an outlet needle. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is flame-dried under argon, then is charged with dry pentanes (800 mL) and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (18.2 mL, 108 mmol, 2.0 equiv) by syringe. The colorless solution is cooled to 0 °C in an ice bath and then a 1.57 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexanes (68.8 mL, 108 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added dropwise by syringe over 15 min in seven roughly equal portions. The resulting yellow LTMP solution is stirred at 0 °C for 30 min further and then is added via cannula over 15 min to the stirring pale-yellow suspension of 2-propenyllithium at −78 °C. The resulting yellow suspension is transferred to an ice bath, is stirred for 30 min and then 1,2-epoxydodecane (11.8 mL, 54.0 mmol) is added dropwise by syringe in three roughly equal portions over 5 min. The ice bath is removed and the resulting yellow suspension is stirred for 2 h.
A warm solution of 3 g. of ammonium nitrate in 50 ml. of anhydrous ethanol is added to a mixture of 44 g. (52.4 ml., 0.79 mole) of acrolein and 144 g. (160 ml., 0.97 mole) of ethyl orthoformate, and the mixture is allowed to react at room temperature for 6–8 hours. The light-red solution is filtered, 4 g. of sodium carbonate is added, and the reaction mixture is distilled from the sodium carbonate through a good column. The fraction boiling at 120–125° is acrolein acetal and weighs 73–81 g. (72–80%); nD25 1.398–1.407.
The flask containing the crude product is equipped with a capillary tube and distilling head and surrounded by a water bath, which may be heated by a hot plate or steam cone. A water-cooled condenser connects the distilling head with the center neck of a two-necked receiver which is surrounded by a Dry Ice bath. The outer neck of the receiver is fitted with a Dry Ice condenser arranged in such a way that vapors which first escape the receiver are condensed and returned to it. This apparatus is connected through a second Dry Ice trap and soda-lime tower to a vacuum pump. A fore-run is removed at a bath temperature of 20° and a pressure of about 15 mm. The receiver is changed, and the product is distilled at 18–25°/5 mm. The temperature of the water bath should not exceed 30°. 3-Chlorocyclopentene is obtained as a colorless liquid in a yield of 70–90% based on cyclopentadiene; n26D 1.4708.
B. 4-Nitroindole. To a solution of 22 g (0.15 mol) of diethyl oxalate in 50 mL of dry dimethylformamide in a 200-mL beaker is added, under cooling, 11 g (0.13 mol) of potassium ethoxide with vigorous stirring and. The solution is immediately (within a few seconds) poured into a 250-mL flask containing a solution of 20.8 g (0.10 mol) of ethyl N-(2-methyl-3-nitrophenyl)formimidate in 75 mL of dry dimethyl sulfoxide. The resulting deep-red solution is stirred for 1 hr at ca. 40°C and. The solution is then transferred into a 1-L beaker and water is added under stirring at a rate that gives smooth precipitation of 4-nitroindole. The product is filtered off and dried, giving 16.3 g (ca. 100%) of a brownish-yellow solid, mp 195–201°C [sublimation (subl.)], which is sublimed at 170°C/0.5 mm giving 11.5 g (71%) of yellow crystals, mp 204–205°C (subl.).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stopper carrying a dropping funnel and a connection to a condenser set for distillation, are placed 750 g. of 6 N sulfuric acid and 250 g. of pinacol hydrate. The mixture is then distilled until the upper layer of distillate ceases to increase in volume. This requires about fifteen to twenty minutes. The pinacolone layer in the distillate is separated from the water and the water is returned to the reaction flask. First, 60 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to the water, and then a second 250-g. portion of pinacol hydrate. The distillation is repeated. This process is repeated twice more until 1 kg. (4.42 moles) of pinacol hydrate has been used.
For workup the reaction mixture is poured into an aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (4 L). The turbid mixture is divided into two parts, and each part is extracted three times with ethyl acetate (3 × 500 mL). The combined organic layers are washed twice with water (2 × 1 L) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After filtration the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation at ca. 45°C/20 mm. The yellow oil that is obtained (103 g) is purified by fractional distillation using a 15-cm Vigreux column (bp 92–95°C/1.5 mm) to afford 84.3 g (77%) of product as a yellowish oil with a specific rotation of [α]RT D −62.0° (neat), −44.0° (CHCl3, c 1) and.
The aerated reaction mixture is heated to 80° and 25 ml. of water is added cautiously, with stirring. A vigorous reaction ensues, and upon cessation of the reaction an additional 300 ml. of water is added.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 4 kg. (2816 cc.) of c.p. concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42). To this is added, in 25-cc. portions, 210 g. (1.23 moles) of nicotine. The addition should be made carefully in order that local heating may not occur and material be lost. After each addition of nicotine, the flask should be shaken in order to insure a homogeneous solution. The addition of the nicotine causes the temperature of the liquid to rise somewhat but not sufficiently to cause evolution of nitrogen dioxide. The flask is placed on a steam bath under a hood and heated until the liquid reaches a temperature of 70°. It is then removed and the reaction allowed to continue spontaneously, sufficient heat being evolved to cause the liquid to boil. The boiling ceases after one hour, but the flask is replaced upon the steam bath for ten to twelve hours, during which time there is a more or less continuous evolution of oxides of nitrogen.
The solid complex is washed with acetonitrile (50 mL). This acetonitrile solution is discarded because of the low ee (~80% ee of the S-enantiomer is contained). The resulting solid complex (96% ee, R-enantiomer) is transferred to a 250-mL flask. Methanol (100 mL) is added, and the resulting suspension is refluxed for 24 hr to upgrade the enantiomeric excess to >99% ee. After the mixture is cooled to room temperature, it is filtered and the solid washed with methanol (20 mL). The solid complex is suspended in a mixture of ethyl acetate (300 mL) and 1 N HCl (150 mL) and stirred until complete dissolution occurs (0.5 hr). The solution is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the organic layer is separated and then washed with 1 N HCl (150 mL) and brine (150 mL). The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to an off-white crystalline solid [9.83-10.16 g, 85-88% recovery, mp 206-207°C, >99.8% ee of the R-enantiomer [α]21 D 26.2~30.9° (THF, c 1)],,.
(B) Itaconic Acid.—Forty grams of itaconic anhydride is refluxed with 100 cc. of water for one hour. The flask is then set aside to cool, and finally placed in an ice bath. The acid crystallizes and is filtered and dried. The yield is 11–18 g. (24–39 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 162–165°. On concentrating the mother liquor to one-third of the original volume, an additional amount of lower-melting product may be obtained and.
(B) Homoveratric Acid.—In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask are placed 250 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 76 g. (0.36 mole) of methyl homoveratrate. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and the mixture is boiled gently. The saponification proceeds rapidly, and the ester layer disappears after about ten minutes. The mixture is refluxed gently for twenty minutes longer, after which the solution is cooled in an ice bath and then poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 125 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 350 g. of ice. Crystals of the hydrate of homoveratric acid separate at once. After standing for about thirty minutes the crystalline product is filtered with suction and washed on the filter with two 25-cc. portions of ice water. The crystals are pressed thoroughly on the filter, pulverized, and allowed to stand overnight in a vacuum desiccator containing soda lime (to remove residual hydrochloric acid) and calcium chloride. The yield in the saponification is almost quantitative and amounts to 70 g. (55 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone). This product melts at 96–97° and contains traces of sodium chloride. For purification it is dissolved in 350 cc. of hot benzene and the solution is filtered. To the hot filtrate is added 150 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 70–80°), and the solution is covered with a watch glass and allowed to cool slowly. After standing for several hours (preferably overnight) in a cool place, the crystals are filtered with suction and washed with a cold solution of 35 cc. of benzene and 15 cc. of ligroin, followed by 50 cc. of cold petroleum ether. The solvent is removed as completely as possible by pressing on the filter and finally by allowing the product to stand in a vacuum desiccator. The purified homoveratric acid weighs 65 g. (51 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original azlactone) and melts sharply at 98°.
The concentrated solution of glycine and ammonium chloride is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, the flask is rinsed with a little water, and this is added to the main portion. The volume of the solution is finally brought to 250 cc. with water, and the glycine is precipitated by the gradual addition of 1500 cc. of methyl alcohol. The solution is well stirred during the addition of the methyl alcohol and is cooled in an ice box for four to six hours to allow complete crystallization. The solution is filtered, and the glycine crystals are washed by suspending them in 500 cc. of 95 per cent methyl alcohol; they are again collected on the filter and washed with a little methyl alcohol and then with ether. After air drying the yield is 108–112 g. of glycine.
Heating is continued on a steam bath, and 189 g. (142 cc.) of methyl sulfate is added through the separatory funnel just rapidly enough to maintain the gentle ebullition which starts after the addition of the first 10–15 cc.. After the addition of all the methyl sulfate, which requires about one hour, the reaction mixture is heated for forty-five minutes longer and an additional portion of 39 g. (30 cc.) of methyl sulfate is added at the same rate as the first portion. At the end of this addition the reaction mixture should show an acid reaction to litmus. After ten minutes' heating the reaction mixture is rendered slightly alkaline by the addition of about 60 cc. of the sodium hydroxide solution (prepared above), and another 39-g. portion of methyl sulfate is added. The alternate addition of sodium hydroxide solution and of methyl sulfate (39-g. portions) is repeated twice more, so that a total of 345 g. (2.7 moles) of methyl sulfate is added. The reaction mixture is then made strongly alkaline by the addition of 150 cc. of the sodium hydroxide solution and is heated for twenty minutes after the last addition of methyl sulfate. The reaction mixture is cooled rapidly to 25° with continued stirring, and the veratraldehyde is extracted with three 300-cc. portions of ether.
The mixture is treated with 40 g. of salt and 200 ml. of chloroform and warmed on the steam bath with vigorous swirling. After 2–3 minutes the clear red chloroform layer is decanted from the semisolid lower layer, and the extraction is repeated twice more with 200- and 100-ml. portions of chloroform respectively. The combined extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, the solution is filtered by gravity through a fluted filter into a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and 500 ml. of hexane is added with swirling. White needles of N-bromoacetamide begin to form at once. After chilling for 1–2 hours, the crystals are collected with suction, washed with hexane, and air-dried. The yield is 19–24 g. (41–51%), m.p. 102–105°, purity 98–100% and.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask, equipped with a thermometer, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a 35-cm. Vigreux column fitted to a condenser and receiver protected by a calcium chloride tube, are placed 345 g. (400 ml.) of dry xylene, 120 g. (117 ml., 1 mole) of dry acetophenone, and 135 g. (0.55 mole) of aluminum tert-butoxide (p. 48). The stirrer is started and the flask heated in an oil bath so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is held between 133° and 137°. tert-Butyl alcohol slowly distils at a temperature in the vapor of 80–85°. The distillation of the alcohol can be accomplished by maintaining the temperature of the heating bath between 150° and 155° for 2 hours after distillation has commenced and.
The alkyne cobalt complex is purified by silica gel chromatography. To the red solution is added 2 g of silica gel and the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The silica gel is then placed under vacuum (1 mm) until effervescence ceases (about 10 min). The dried silica gel is placed at the top of a column of silica gel (diameter: 3 cm; height: 9 cm), eluting first with hexane to remove non-polar by-products and subsequently with 15% ether/hexane. The desired product elutes as a red band. Concentration of the appropriate fractions on a rotary evaporator and under high vacuum (0.7 mm for 10 min) affords 1.4 g (79%) of 5 as a fine red powder.
C. Atropaldehyde. The acetal (15 g), placed in a 100-mL flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a thermometer, is cooled to about 4°C in an ice bath. A mixture of 15 mL of formic acid and 4 mL of water is similarly cooled and added in one lot with stirring to the acetal. The temperature drops to about −4°C. The homogenous mixture is stirred for 60 sec and then quenched by adding 15 mL of petroleum ether and 25 mL of water. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken. The aqueous phase is extracted with two additional 15-mL portions of petroleum ether, and the combined extracts are dried as above with magnesium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo. A mixture of 10 mL each of petroleum ether and diethyl ether is added to the crude aldehyde, and the solution is cooled to about −50°C. After 15 min the colorless crystals are filtered and washed with a few milliliters of the solvent cooled to 0°C. The yield of vacuum-dried product is 5.8–6.8 g (71–83%). Recrystallization from a mixture of 10 mL each of diethyl ether and petroleum ether as above gives 5–6 g, mp 38–40°C and.
To the solution of the Grignard reagent is added a solution of 102 g. (0.25 mole) of methyl desoxycholate in 700 ml. of dry benzene. The desoxycholate is washed into the flask with 500 ml. of dry benzene, and the mixture is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours. After cooling, the complex is decomposed by pouring its benzene solution into a mixture of about 4 l. of ice and 700 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After thorough shaking, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted twice with ether. The combined ether solution is washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, water, 5% sodium hydroxide solution, and finally with water. The solvent and some biphenyl are removed by steam distillation; approximately 5 hours is required to remove the biphenyl formed during the preparation of the Grignard reagent. The lumps should be broken up from time to time, if necessary. After cooling, the residue of crude 3,12-dihydroxy-nor-cholanyldiphenylcarbinol is collected and dried.
A. 2-Methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a reflux condenser capped with an argon-inlet tube is charged with 126.1 g (1 mol) of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione and 300 mL of distilled water. To the well-stirred suspension are added 3 mL of acetic acid, 1.1 g of hydroquinone, and 142 g (167 mL, 2 mol) of freshly distilled methyl vinyl ketone. The reaction mixture is stirred under argon at 72–75°C for 1 hr, cooled to room temperature, treated with sodium chloride (103 g), and poured into a separatory funnel containing ethyl acetate (400 mL). The organic phase is collected and the aqueous phase is reextracted twice with ethyl acetate (150 mL each time). The combined extracts are washed with two 200-mL portions of saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered, and the filtrate is evaporated at 40°C under reduced pressure (water aspirator) on a rotary evaporator. The residue is kept under high vacuum (1.0 mm) at 40°C for 30 min to give 210.8 g of crude 2-methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)-1,3-cyclohexanedione (1, "trione") as a pale-yellow oil, homogeneous by thin-layer chromatography. This crude material is used in Step B.
The crude anhydride is carefully fractionated through a 13-mm. × 1.2-m. Nester still at a pressure of 25 mm. and a reflux ratio of at least 10:1. After a fore-run of maleic anhydride, b.p. 50–100°/25 mm., and a small intermediate fraction, there is obtained 75–90 g. (22–26%) of 3-methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride; b.p. 155–159°/25 mm.; n25D 1.4935–1.4952. This material is of sufficient purity for most uses, but it contains approximately 2–5% of propargylsuccinic anhydride. Redistillation through the Nester still gives 65–80 g.. (19–23%) of 3-methylenecyclobutane-1,2-dicarboxylic anhydride; b.p. 155°/25 mm.; n25D 1.4946–1.4955.
A vigorously stirred, particle-free solution of 170 g. (1.02 moles) of phthalic acid and 281 g. of sodium acetate in 1.7 l. of water is cooled in an ice bath while a total of 3400 g. of 3% sodium amalgam is added in 50–100 g. portions. With each portion of added amalgam there is also added 10–20 ml. (500 ml. total) of 50% acetic acid. The total addition time required is 4–5 hours. The solution is decanted from the mercury onto a Buchner funnel and filtered with suction through a layer of Celite 545. The cold filtrate is treated with 1.7 l. of cold 20% sulfuric acid; the acid begins to crystallize immediately. After standing for 4 hours at 20–22°, the acid is collected by suction filtration, washed well with ice-cold water, removing excess sulfuric acid, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid, giving 124 g. (72%) of crystalline product, m.p. 210–213°. A purer product can be obtained by recrystallization. For minimum losses during recrystallization, the crude acid is divided into two portions, and each is added to 1.2–1.5 l. of rapidly stirred, boiling water to effect as rapid a solution as possible. When almost all of the solids have dissolved ca. 1 g. of activated charcoal (Norit) is added, the solution is filtered through a fluted filter, and the filtrate is cooled in ice to induce rapid crystallization. The colorless crystals are collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure, yielding 93–107 g. (54–62%) of the acid, m.p. 212–214°.
A 500-mL flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser, is charged with 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol (23.0 g, 80 mmol) and N-benzylcinchonidinium chloride (18.6 g, 44 mmol). Acetonitrile (300 mL) is added, and the resulting suspension is refluxed for 4 hr, cooled and stirred at room temperature overnight. The mixture is then cooled to 0–5°C, kept at that temperature for 2 hr, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness, redissolved in ethyl acetate (300 mL), and washed with 1 N hydrochloric acid (HCl, 2 × 100 mL) and brine (100 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated to a light brown solid [10.28–10.65 g, mp 205-206°C, 89-93% recovery, 99.0% ee S-enantiomer [α]21 D −27.6~−29.4° ( THF , c 1)],,.
To 500 cc. of absolute alcohol in a 1-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser is added gradually 46 g. (2 atoms) of sodium in thin slices at such a rate that the mixture boils steadily. When all the sodium has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam bath until the few remaining pieces of sodium barely react. Pure commercial molten phenol is now added gradually through the condenser until all the sodium has reacted, and then the remainder of 188 g. (2 moles) of phenol is added. This is followed by the addition of 221 g. (2 moles) of redistilled glycerol α-monochlorohydrin (p. 294) in small portions, the rather vigorous reaction being allowed to complete itself before each subsequent addition.
The brown mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, 100 ml. of ether is added, and the mixture heated at reflux for another 30 minutes. The brown suspension is diluted with 400 ml. of ether, after which 100 ml. of 1,4-dioxane is added carefully over 15 minutes, moderating the mildly exothermic reaction. The light-gray suspension is stirred for 30 minutes.
As soon as reflux is terminated, the solution is poured rapidly into a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, allowed to cool, and diluted with enough anhydrous diethyl ether to make the total volume about 850 ml.. After the flask has been sealed and refrigerated for one hour, the precipitate is removed by rapid filtration (water aspirator) through a 150-ml. Büchner funnel and washed with three 50-ml. portions of anhydrous ether. The clear yellow filtrate is concentrated as follows. A 300-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mm. Vigreux column topped with a distillation head. The filtrate is placed in a 1-l., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel inserted into the top of the distillation head. Approximately 100 ml. is run down through the column into the flask, which is then heated. As ether is removed by distillation, the remainder of the filtrate is dripped into the flask at a constant rate, and in this way the solution is concentrated into a small flask in a continuous operation. Distillation is continued until most of the ether has been removed, and the resulting murky solution is heated at 40° (80 mm.), removing the remaining volatiles.
After the addition has been completed, the solution is heated under reflux for 10–15 minutes. The flask is now surrounded by an ice and water bath, and stirring is continued for 15 minutes. From a graduated dropping funnel, a solution of 56.8 g. (0.4 mole) of sec-butyl crotonate in 400 ml. of dry ether is then added dropwise during a period of about 3 hours while the reaction mixture is effectively stirred and cooled in the ice bath. After the addition of the ester solution is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred in the ice bath for an additional 15 minutes. The ice bath is then removed, and stirring of the grayish brown solution is continued at room temperature for 1 hour.
A. 2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-glucopyranose. A dry, 2000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar (41 × 19 mm) and an ice-salt bath, and at the respective necks with a thermometer, a septum, and a rubber stopper. A nitrogen atmosphere is incorporated by a needle inserted through the septum. The stopper is temporarily removed, replaced with a funnel and acetic anhydride (900 mL, 9.52 mol, Note 1) is added from a bottle that had been stored in a refrigerator at 5 °C. The stopper is replaced and the acetic anhydride is cooled to 0 °C (internal temperature) with stirring, the stopper is again replaced by a funnel, and then 80.0 g (362 mmol) of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and 270 g of montmorillonite K-10 are sequentially added over a 10-min period such that the internal temperature does not rise above ambient. The stopper is replaced, the ice bath is removed, and the suspension is stirred for 24 h.
C. (S)-2-Methylproline. In a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, 20.1 g (0.102 mol) of (2R,5S)-2-tert-butyl-5-methyl-1-aza-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-4-one in 400 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) is heated to reflux for 1 hr. The water is removed under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator (ca. 15 mm). The dark residue is treated with 400 mL of 3 N HCl and extracted four times with 200 mL each of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). The combined organic layers are washed once with 200 mL of 3 N HCl. The combined aqueous layers are concentrated and dried under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator at elevated temperature (60°C at 15 mm). The residue is suspended in 50 mL of water and adsorbed on 600 g of Dowex 50W × 8 (H+ form) in a 50 × 380-mm column. Water is passed through the column. After 200 mL of effluent, the pH changes to 2; after another 700 mL, the pH of the effluent is 7. The amino acid is then eluted with 3 N aqueous ammonia. After 500 mL of effluent, the developing hot front reaches the outlet. The following 2000 mL are collected and yield 12.0–12.3 g of the amino acid, free of inorganic salts, after removal of the water and. The 500 mL of water collected subsequently contains another 0.34 g, yielding altogether 93–98 mmol [85–90% from (2R,5S)-2-tert-butyl-1-aza-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-4-one] of (S)-2-methylproline, [α]DRT −71.1° to −72.1° (MeOH, c 1.0), mp 248–252°C (dec). The enantiomeric excess (ee) of a sample with a rotation of −72.1° was shown to be 99.0 ± 0.5% by capillary gas chromatographic analysis of a derivative using a chiral column (see Figure 1).
C. Carbobenzoxyglycine. A solution of 7.5 g. (0.1 mole) of glycine in 50 ml. of 2 N sodium hydroxide is placed in a 200-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and two dropping funnels. The flask is cooled in an, ice bath, and 17 g. (0.1 mole) of benzyl chloroformate (21–24 g. of the solution obtained in A) and 25 ml. of 4 N sodium hydroxide are added simultaneously to the vigorously stirred solution over a period of 20–25 minutes. The mixture is stirred for an additional 10 minutes. The toluene layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with ether. The aqueous solution is cooled in an ice bath and acidified to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitate is filtered, washed with small portions of cold water, and dried in the air. It is practically pure carbobenzoxyglycine; it weighs 18–19 g. (86–91%) and melts at 119–120°. The material may be recrystallized from chloroform; it then melts at 120°.
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a thermometer, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel are placed 80 g. (0.67 mole) of acetophenone, 60 ml. of ether, and 100 ml. of water. The apparatus is assembled in a well-ventilated hood, the flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and 82 g. (1.67 moles) of granulated sodium cyanide is added all at once with vigorous stirring. When most of the sodium cyanide has dissolved and the temperature of the mixture has fallen to 5°, 140 ml. (1.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature remains between 5° and 10°. The addition requires about 1.7 hours. After all the acid has been added, the cooling bath is removed and vigorous stirring is continued for 2 hours. The mixture is allowed to settle, and the liquid portion is decanted into a 1-l. separatory funnel. The water layer is returned to the reaction flask, and 100 ml. of water is added to dissolve the salts. The aqueous solution is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of ether, and the original ether layer and extracts are combined in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. The ether is distilled at 20–30 mm. pressure (water aspirator), and the residual oil is poured slowly with stirring into 160 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture then is saturated with hydrogen chloride gas in the hood and and allowed to stand overnight.
The free base is liberated by adding to the phenylhydrazine hydrochloride 1 l. of a 25 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide. The phenylhydrazine separates and is taken up with benzene (two 300-cc. portions). The combined extractions are well dried with 200 g. of solid sodium hydroxide, poured off, and distilled. Most of the benzene may be distilled under ordinary pressure, and the remainder, and any low-boiling impurities, under diminished pressure. The pure phenylhydrazine boils at 137–138°/18 mm., and is obtained as a pale yellow liquid. It can be crystallized on cooling in an ice bath; the crystals melt at 23°. The crude phenylhydrazine from two lots of aniline (744 g.) is best distilled at one time and gives 695–725 g. of pure product (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 3-Methylfuran. A mixture of 25 g. of 3-methyl-2-furoic acid, 50 g. of quinoline, and 4.5 g. of copper powder is placed in a 125-ml. round-bottomed flask attached by a ground joint to a 30-cm. simple Vigreux column which delivers to a water-cooled condenser. The condenser is connected to a small distilling flask which serves as receiver, with the tip of the condenser extending to the edge of the bulb of the flask. The receiver is cooled in an ice-salt bath. The round-bottomed flask is heated by means of an electric mantle or liquid bath.
In a 500-ml. three-necked flask, provided with a stirrer, are placed 15 g. (0.09 mole) of finely powdered uric acid, 30 g. (25.2 ml.) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 40 ml. of water. The mixture is warmed to 30°, the stirrer is started, and 4 g. (0.014 mole) of finely powdered potassium chlorate is added in small portions during a period of not less than 45 minutes. Most of the uric acid dissolves; any undissolved material is removed by filtration through a fritted-glass filter. The clear filtrate is diluted with 30 ml. of water, and a rapid stream of hydrogen sulfide is led into it until it is saturated (about 10–15 minutes). Sulfur and alloxantin separate, and the mixture is cooled for 2–3 hours in an ice bath until the separation is complete.
The flask is again cooled in the Dry Ice bath, and 41 g. (0.35 mole) of benzyl cyanide is added during about 10 minutes through a dry dropping funnel. The Dry Ice bath is removed, and the clear solution is stirred for about 15 minutes, after which 200 ml. of dry sulfur-free toluene and 25 ml. of anhydrous ether are added dropwise through the funnel while the ammonia evaporates. The solution is allowed to stand or is warmed in a water bath until it comes to room temperature; the ammonia may be vaporized at any rate that does not cause gas to escape through the mercury seal on the stirrer. The remainder of the ammonia is removed by turning off the water in the reflux condenser, warming the flask in a hot water bath, and distilling most of the ether (and ammonia) through the reflux condenser.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 88 g. (0.75 mole) of o-tolunitrile (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 514), 300 cc. (2.6 moles) of 30 per cent hydrogen peroxide, 400 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, and 30 cc. of 6 N sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture evolves oxygen and soon warms up owing to the heat of reaction; the temperature is kept at 40–50° by external cooling. After about one hour, heat is no longer evolved; the temperature is then maintained at 50° by external heating for an additional three hours. The mixture, while still warm, is made exactly neutral to litmus with 5 per cent sulfuric acid and distilled with steam until 1 l. of distillate is collected. The residue, which has a volume of about 600 cc., is poured while hot into a 1-l. beaker and cooled to 20°. The crystals which form are filtered with suction. They are transferred to a mortar and ground to a paste with 100 cc. of cold water, filtered again, and then washed on the filter with an additional 100 cc. of cold water. The o-toluamide is obtained in the form of white crystals melting at 141–141.5°. The yield of air-dried product is 91–93 g. (90–92 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product may be recrystallized from water (10 g. per 100 cc.). The recovery is 92 per cent, and the melting point is not changed.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed, two-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer with a mercury seal, are placed 660 cc. of cold water and 135 g. of cracked ice. Two hundred grams (containing about 1.4 moles of pure calcium cyanamide) of fresh lime-nitrogen is added slowly, with stirring. As soon as the lime-nitrogen is suspended thoroughly in the water, a cold solution of 110 g. (2.75 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water is added slowly, with stirring. Then the suspension is stirred quite briskly during one hour. If the temperature rises above 25°, small amounts of ice should be added.
A. 1-Hydroxy-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one 1-oxide (1) . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and an immersion thermometer is charged with 80.0 g (0.48 mol) of potassium bromate (KBrO3) and 750 mL of 2.0 M sulfuric acid,(Note 2),(Note 3). The resulting clear solution is heated to 60°C in an oil bath and 80.0 g of finely powdered 2-iodobenzoic acid (0.323 mol) is added in ~10-g portions over 40 min,. The solution becomes red-orange, bromine vapor is evolved, and a white solid begins to separate. After the addition is complete, the temperature is maintained at an internal temperature of 65°C for 2.5 hr.
A mixture of 300 g. (2.25 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 1.5 l. (17 moles) of benzene (dried over sodium and distilled) is placed in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and, with rapid stirring, the adipyl chloride is added through the dropping funnel at an even rate during the course of forty-five minutes. The reaction mixture darkens slowly but does not become black. After the adipyl chloride has been added, the ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for two hours at room temperature.
In a 5-l. flask fitted with a long condenser (about 40 cm.) connected to an ice-cooled receiver is placed 2 l. of 7% (by volume) sulfuric acid. The solution is heated to boiling, and the crude monoformate of 1,2-indanediol is added. Steam is introduced and the mixture is steam distilled, while external heat is applied with a flame in order to maintain the boiler contents at a constant volume of 2 l. The steam distillation is carried out at the rate of about 1 l. per hour until 5–6 l. of distillate have been collected and the 2-indanone has stopped distilling. The dark-brown oily residue becomes semisolid at room temperature.
(A) Extraction with Benzene.—The mandelic acid is separated from the ammonium chloride by extraction with hot benzene. This is best done by dividing the solid mixture into ten approximately equal parts. One of these portions is placed in a flask with 1 l. of boiling benzene. After a few minutes the hot benzene solution is decanted through a suction funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath and the mandelic acid that crystallizes is filtered with suction. The benzene is returned to the extraction flask containing the residue from the first extraction, and a new portion of the ammonium chloride-mandelic acid mixture is added and extracted as before. The process is repeated until the mandelic acid is completely removed from the ammonium chloride.
O4,O5-Isopropylidene-1,2:3,6-dianhydro-D-glucitol (2) . An oven-dried, 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 250-mL, pressure-equalizing, dropping funnel, and a rubber septum with a needle connected to a dry nitrogen source. The nitrogen-flushed apparatus is charged with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and 2.8 g (0.117 mol) of sodium hydride. The stirred suspension is cooled in an ice-water bath and a solution of 31 g (0.099 mol) of the crude iodo alcohol 1 in 150 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise through the dropping funnel during 1 hr. After the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is rinsed with 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran . After the mixture is stirred for 5 hr at room temperature, it is concentrated to a volume of about 100 mL under reduced pressure; then 150 mL of diethyl ether is added. The solution is recooled to 0°C and carefully quenched with 30 mL of an aqueous saturated solution of ammonium chloride . The whole mixture is poured into a 500-mL separatory funnel. After separation of the aqueous layer, the organic layer is washed twice with 20 mL of an aqueous saturated solution of sodium chloride . The combined aqueous layers, after addition of 50 mL of water, are extracted with two 50-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate , filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 16.6 g of a light beige solid. Recrystallization from hexane (180 mL) gives 13.3 g of pure epoxide 2 as white needles (mp 77°C). The overall yield from isosorbide is 72%.
The purple quinizarin solution is next saturated with carbon dioxide and the precipitated quinizarin again filtered. The product is then boiled with 5 l. of a 10 per cent solution of sodium carbonate until it appears black (probably the monosodium salt) to dissolve the last traces of purpurin. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the precipitate is boiled with 5 l. of 5 per cent hydrochloric acid to liberate the quinizarin. The mixture is again cooled to room temperature, and the final product is filtered, washed with cold water, and dried at 100°.
In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer and a thermometer are placed 1500 ml. of acetic anhydride and 300 g. (306 ml., 3.80 moles) of dry pyridine. Three hundred grams (4.6 gram atoms) of zinc dust, in amounts of 5–10 g., is added with stirring over a period of 3 hours. Heat is evolved almost immediately, and a cooling bath of water may be necessary. The reaction mixture becomes green after about 20 minutes. The temperature of the contents of the flask should be maintained between 25° and 30°. After the addition of the first 300-g. portion of zinc, 300 ml. of acetic acid is added to the reaction mixture and a reflux condenser is attached to the flask. Then 120 g. (1.83 gram atoms) of zinc dust is added in small portions. Heat is evolved during the addition, and the reaction may become rather violent. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 30 minutes. A third portion of 180 g. (2.75 gram atoms) of zinc dust is added all at once, and refluxing is continued for an additional half hour. The solution is now orange-brown.
The oil is separated from the distillate, and the aqueous portion is shaken out once with 150–200 cc. of benzene. The united oil and extract are dried with a small quantity of calcium chloride and distilled, first under atmospheric pressure to remove the benzene, and finally under reduced pressure. The m-nitrotoluene passes over entirely at 113–114°/15 mm. On cooling, it forms a pale yellow solid which melts at 16°. The yield of pure material is 95–110 g. (62–72 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The main fraction of n-butyl borate is redistilled from a Claisen flask provided with an indented fractionating column, and the first 4–6 cc. of distillate is rejected. The purified product, b.p. 103–105°/8 mm. or 114–115°/15 mm., weighs 400–425 g. (87–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer, and an ice-cooled spiral condenser (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 529) is placed a solution of 98 g. (84.5 cc., 0.8 mole) of ethyl chloroacetate in 200 cc. of absolute alcohol. The solution is cooled to 0° by stirring in a salt-ice bath; and, after the stirrer is stopped, 74 cc. (49 g., 0.83 mole) of trimethylamine, measured after precooling to −5°, is added all at once. The exothermic reaction is controlled sufficiently by cooling so that the temperature of the mixture rises to 60° in the course of about one hour. When there is no longer any heat effect, the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for twenty hours (without replenishment of the condenser ice).
After ozone generation has been stopped, pure oxygen is passed through the reaction mixture, removing excess ozone. Dry ice cooling is continued while 21 g. (0.34 mole) of dimethyl sulfide is added in one portion, and the mixture is then allowed to come to ambient temperature overnight (18 hours). Methanol is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is dissolved in 250 ml. of diethyl ether. This solution is percolated through a short mat of silica gel (50 g.), removing polar impurities, then concentrated with a rotary evaporator, leaving a residue which is stirred with 30 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid for 45 minutes. Chloroform (40 ml.) is added, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is further extracted with two 30-ml. portions of chloroform. The organic extracts are combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Vacuum distillation of the residue with a Kugelrohr apparatus gives 22.7 g. (73%) of 2,5-heptanedione, b.p. 90° (20 mm.), nD20 1.4313.
After the reaction has been allowed to proceed for an hour without heating, an additional 244 g. (309 ml., 3.3 moles) of dry tert-butyl alcohol (total quantity, 6 moles) and 200 ml. of dry benzene are added. The reaction will again set in upon gentle heating and will continue vigorously without further heating. After about 2 hours the reaction subsides and the mixture is refluxed for about 10 hours.
A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 30-cm. Vigreux column connected to a condenser. The condenser leads to an automatic separator arranged so that the lighter liquid is returned to the flask.1 In the flask is placed a mixture of 189 g. (167 ml., 2 moles) of trimethylene chlorohydrin,2 180 g. (172 ml., 3 moles) of glacial acetic acid, 300 ml. of benzene, and 2 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The mixture is refluxed at such a rate that the temperature at the top of the column remains at 69° (boiling point of benzene-water azeotrope) during the time the greatest amount of water is distilling, and rises gradually to 80° (boiling point of benzene-acetic acid azeotrope) as the last of the water is removed. The volume of the aqueous layer collected varies with the temperature of the vapors and the length of time required for distillation, but it is approximately 50 ml. at the end of the reaction; the time required is 7–9 hours.
B. Hydroxymethylimidazole hydrochloride. One hundred and twenty grams (100 ml., 1.2 moles) of 37% hydrochloric acid, 250 ml. of water, and 500 ml. of benzene are placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, which is then immersed in a water bath maintained at 80°. One hundred grams of the pure picrate (0.306 mole) is added to this mixture, and the flask is shaken thoroughly until the picrate dissolves. The benzene layer is decanted. The aqueous layer is then extracted 5 times with 330-ml. portions of benzene, treated with about 3 g. of Norit, and filtered through a wet filter paper. The clear, pale yellow filtrate is evaporated to dryness at 60–70° under reduced pressure. The resulting pale yellow to slightly brown crystals are taken up in the minimum quantity (30–35 ml.) of hot absolute ethanol. Colorless needles deposit on cooling. Three to four volumes of ethyl ether are added, and the mixture is kept in the refrigerator overnight. The almost colorless needles are filtered and, after being washed with a small amount of ether, are dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield amounts to 37–39 g. (90–95%) of a product which melts at 107–109° after sintering a few degrees lower.
This product is approximately 75 per cent pure and is purified further by recrystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 70–90°). The yield of purified product melting at 53–54° is 8.4–9.9 g. (42–50 per cent of the theoretical amount).
D. Reduction of (S)-(−)-BINAPO to (S)-(−)-BINAP. In a 300-mL, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser which is connected through a three-way stopcock to an argon inlet tube and a bubbler, is placed 4.5 g (6.9 mmol) of (S)-BINAPO. The flask is flushed with argon followed by the addition of 100 mL of dry, degassed xylene, 4.2 mL of triethylamine (3.1 g, 30 mmol), and 3.0 mL (4.0 g, 29 mmol) of trichlorosilane by means of syringes. The mixture is stirred and heated at 100°C for 1 hr, at 120°C for 1 hr, and finally at refluxing temperature for 6 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, 70 mL of 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is carefully added. The mixture is then stirred at 60°C until the organic and aqueous layers become clear, and it is transferred into a 300-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of warm toluene. The combined organic layer is washed with 70 mL of 30% sodium hydroxide solution and three 100-mL portions of water, and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 15 mL, and to this added 15 mL of degassed methanol. The precipitates are collected on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with 15 mL of methanol, and dried at 80°C (0.05 mm) for 6 hr to give 4.2 g (97% yield) of (S)-BINAP as colorless solid, mp 236–238°C, [α]D25 −223° (benzene, c 0.502) and.
A. (S)-(+)-p-Toluenesulfinamide (2) :2 An oven-dried, 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum is charged with 30.31 g (0.103 mol) of (1R,2S,5R)-(−)-menthyl (S)-p-toluenesulfinate (1) under an argon purge. The reaction flask is placed under vacuum for 1 hr to remove residual moisture, 220 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added via cannula, and the solution is rapidly stirred and cooled to −78°C using a dry ice/acetone bath. To the white suspension is added 143.0 mL (0.143 mol) of 1.0 M lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide (LiHMDS) via syringe. The dry ice/acetone bath is removed and the solution is stirred for 4.5 hr at room temperature. The mixture is then cooled to −78°C in a dry ice/acetone bath, 30% aq ammonium chloride (120 mL) is added, and the mixture is warmed to room temperature. The solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, diluted with water (80 mL), and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 160 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (2 × 120 mL), brine (120 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , filtered into a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. To the residual yellow paste is added pentane (100 mL). After standing overnight in the refrigerator (3°C), and warming to room temperature, the resulting solid is collected by suction filtration. The filter cake is rinsed with pentane (2 × 50 mL) and dried under vacuum to afford 11.52 g (72%) of analytically pure 2 as a white solid.
A. 2-Bromo-2-methyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ethyl ester (1). A flame-dried, two-necked, 50-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is fitted with septa to prevent exposure to air. Needles are then used for both an argon inlet and gas outlet to a bubbler. To this flask is added Rh2(OAc)4 (47.4 mg, 0.214 mmol Rh, 0.2 mol%) followed by 2-bromopropene (18.5 mL, 25.2 g, 0.208 mol, 2.18 equiv) by syringe. The argon inlet is removed and ethyl diazoacetate (11.0 mL, 11.1 g, 95.2 mmol, 1.00 equiv) is added by syringe pump over a period of two days. Once the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 8 h. The gas outlet is then removed and one septum is replaced with a one-piece, vacuum-jacketed short path distillation head containing an 18 mm (length) × 13 mm (OD) Vigreaux column. The excess 2-bromopropene is removed by distillation (760 mmHg, bp 42-45 °C). The reaction flask is cooled to room temperature, vacuum is applied (18–22 mmHg), and the flask is gradually heated in an oil bath to a bath temperature of 80 °C. This distillation provides 15.3-18.0 g (78–91% yield) of the bromo ester 1 (bp 64–73 °C, 18–22 mmHg) as a clear, colorless liquid.
The 3β-hydroxyetienic acid is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a condenser protected with a drying tube and is dissolved with warming in 150 ml. of dry pyridine. After the solution has cooled to room temperature, 20 ml. of acetic anhydride is added; a white crystalline precipitate starts to form immediately. After the mixture has stood for 18–24 hours, it is treated with 20 ml. of water and boiled until the precipitate has dissolved. The clear solution is diluted with 70 ml. of water and allowed to cool. The crystalline product is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum oven at 105°/20 mm. The yield of 3β-acetoxyetienic acid, m.p. 235–238°, is 23–24 g. Recrystallization from glacial acetic acid gives a purer product, m.p. 238–240°. The yield is 16–18 g. (55–63% based on the amount of pregnenolone acetate used).
A cooled solution of 60 g. (1.365 moles) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde in 200 ml. of dry ether is added through the dropping funnel during 2–3.5 hours, as rapidly as the condenser capacity permits. The mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 1 hour after the addition is completed.
E. Δ4-Cholesten-3-one. A mixture of 100 g. of Δ5-cholesten-3-one (0.26 mole), 10 g. (0.11 mole) of anhydrous oxalic acid, and 800 ml. of 95% ethanol is heated on the steam bath until all the solid is dissolved (15 minutes) and for 10 minutes longer, and then is allowed to stand at room temperature. If crystallization has not started after a period of several hours, the solution is seeded or scratched. After crystallization has proceeded at room temperature and then at 0–4°, the large, colorless, prismatic needles that separate are collected by suction filtration; yield in the first crop 88–92 g., m.p. 81–82°, [α]D25 92° chloroform (c = 2.01); λmax.ethanol 242 mμ (ε = 17,000). A second crop (5.0–7.5 g., melting in the range 78–82°) is obtained after concentration of the mother liquor to a volume of about 100 ml., and a third crop (3–4 g., low melting) by dilution with water. Recrystallization of these crops from 95% ethanol gives a total of 6.8–8.1 g. of satisfactory material, m.p. 81–82°; total yield 96–98 g. (68–69% over-all yield from cholesterol).
C. (E)-1-Phenyl-3,3-dimethyl-1-butene. In a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, rubber septum, and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 17.8 g (0.08 mol) of 2-methyl-2-(2-phenylethenyl)-1,3-dithiolane and 2.17 g (0.004 mol) of [1,3-bis(diphenylphosphino)propane]nickel(II) chloride [NiCl2(dppp)]. The flask is evacuated and flushed with nitrogen three times. To the above mixture is added 300 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The ether solution of methylmagnesium iodide prepared in Step B is introduced with a double-ended needle in one portion. The mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hr, cooled to room temperature, and treated with 200 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with ether (3 × 200-mL). The combined organic layers are washed twice with aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution (100 mL) and with brine (100 mL). The organic solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is filtered through a short column packed with 30 g of silica gel and flushed under a positive nitrogen pressure with 350 mL of hexane. After the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure, the yellowish residue is distilled through a spinning band to give 10.4 g (81%) of (E)-1-phenyl-3,3-dimethyl-1-butene as a colorless liquid, bp 91–93°C/30 mm.
Cyanogen iodide of highest purity may be produced in the following way. The above crude product is dissolved in 150 ml. of boiling chloroform, and the solution is filtered through a plug of glass-wool on a hot-water funnel into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. This solution, after being cooled at room temperature for 15 minutes, is placed in an ice-salt bath and cooled to −10°. By means of suction filtration, the crystalline product is collected on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with three 15-ml. portions of cold chloroform (0°), and freed from the last traces of solvent by being placed on a watch glass and exposed to the atmosphere (in a good hood) at room temperature for 1 hour. Practically colorless needle-shaped crystals weighing 45 g. (59%) are obtained; m.p. 146–147° and.
A. 2-(Bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane.2 A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 10-mL Dean–Stark apparatus and a condenser. The flask is charged with 30.0 g (0.138 mol) of 1-bromo-3-chloro-2,2-dimethoxypropane, 10.0 mL (0.138 mol) of 1,3-propanediol, and 3 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. The resulting solution is heated (bath temperature 140°C) for 8 hr with distillative removal of methanol (ca. 11 mL). The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and the crude product is partitioned in 150 mL of pentane and 40 mL of water. The organic phase is dried with magnesium sulfate and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. Distillation (1 mm, 90–95°C) yields 25.5–27.7 g (81–88%) of 2-(bromomethyl)-2-(chloromethyl)-1,3-dioxane, mp 57–59°C.
In the distilling flask are placed a solution of 6 g. of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 10 ml. of water, 35 ml. of Carbitol, 10 ml. of ether, and the "Teflon"-coated bar of a magnetic stirrer. The dropping funnel is attached and adjusted so that the stem is just above the surface of the solution in the distilling flask. There is placed in the dropping funnel a solution of 21.5 g. (0.1 mole) of p-tolylsulfonylmethylnitrosamide (p.943) in 125 ml. of ether. The distilling flask is heated in a water bath at 70–75°, the stirrer is started, and the nitrosamide solution is added at a regular rate during 15–20 minutes. As soon as all the nitrosamide solution has been added, additional ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added at the previous rate until the distillate is colorless. Usually 50–100 ml. additional of ether is required. The distillate contains 2.7–2.9 g. (64–69%) of diazomethane, as determined by titration2 and.
When the reaction is complete, the flask is removed from the oil bath and the cooled reaction mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel and extracted with three 1-l. portions of water. The water extract is carefully acidified with 20% hydrochloric acid, and the crude menthoxyacetic acid, which collects on top as a brown oil, is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene extracts are combined, and the solvent is removed by distillation on a steam cone. The residue is then fractionally distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling below 100°/20 mm. is mainly water and toluene. The second fraction boiling at 100–115°/8–10 mm. is impure l-menthol and may be saved for redistillation. The yield of l-menthoxyacetic acid, boiling at 134–137°/2 mm. (150–155°/4 mm.), [α]2D −92.4°, amounts to 166–180 g. (78–84%).
A. Hexadehydro[18]annulene. A 12-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with a stopcock at the bottom is fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is placed in a large metal vessel equipped with a hot–cold water inlet and a drain. The flask is charged with 600 g. (3.00 moles) of copper(II) acetate monohydrate and 3.8 l. of pyridine. Stirring is begun and warm water is added to the metal vessel to heat the contents of the flask to 55 ± 1°, and the mixture is slowly stirred at this temperature for 1 hour. With vigorous stirring (approximately 600 r.p.m.,), a solution of 50 g. (0.64 mole) of 1,5-hexadiyne in 400 ml. of pyridine is added over 30 minutes to the 55°, green suspension. The mixture is stirred vigorously at this temperature for an additional 2 hours before the warm water in the metal vessel is allowed to drain and is replaced with a mixture of ice and water. When the contents of the flask have cooled, the mixture is drawn off through the stopcock at the bottom of the flask and filtered through a 25-cm. Büchner funnel (Filtrate A). The green residue is transferred to a 5-l. beaker and 2.5 l. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene–diethyl ether is added. The mixture is stirred well, avoiding emulsion formation, and filtered (Filtrate B). The residue is similarly extracted with 2.5 l. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene–ether and filtered (Filtrate C). Each filtrate is kept separate.
Seventy-six grams (1 mole) of thiourea is suspended in 200 cc. of water in a 500-cc. flask equipped with a reflux condenser, dropping funnel, and mechanical stirrer. The stirrer is started, and 92.5 g. (80 cc., 1 mole) of chloroacetone is run in during thirty minutes. As the reaction proceeds the thiourea dissolves and the temperature rises. The yellow solution is refluxed for two hours and cooled, and, while the mixture is stirred continuously but not so rapidly as to produce a troublesome emulsion, 200 g. of solid sodium hydroxide is added with cooling. The upper, oily layer is separated in a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with ether, using a total of 300 cc.. The dark red oil is combined with the ethereal extract, and the solution is dried over 30 g. of solid sodium hydroxide and filtered by gravity to remove small amounts of tar. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the oil is distilled at reduced pressure. After a very small fore-run, 2-amino-4-methylthiazole is collected at 117–120°/8 mm., or 130–133°/18 mm. The yield of material melting at 44–45° is 80–85.5 g. (70–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The apparatus is allowed to cool to room temperature, the pressure is released, and the catalyst is removed by filtration. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure at room temperature yields a colorless oil.
C. 3-Phenyl-4-pentenal. In a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 20.1 g (0.098 mol) of (E)-3-[(E)-3-phenyl-2-propenoxy]acrylic acid from B. The flask is fitted with a distillation head for vacuum distillation and heated at 0.1 mm pressure. The oil-bath temperature is maintained at 160–165°C while the mixture is stirred, until all the material melts. Once the initial reaction is under control, the oil bath is slowly heated to 180°C. The product is collected in a receiver flask cooled with a dry ice–acetone bath to give 13.3–14.3 g (84–91% yield) of 3-phenyl-4-pentenal, bp 114–115°C (15 mm).
In a 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful slow-speed stirrer having a Teflon® blade, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, and a thermometer arranged to dip into the liquid is placed 588 g. (366 ml., 6 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is surrounded by an ice-salt mixture, the stirrer started, and 1216 g. (1170 ml., 12 moles) of acetic anhydride is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20°. The separatory funnel is removed and 912 g. (6 moles) of coarsely powdered D,L-camphor is added. The flask is then closed with a stopper and stirring is continued until the camphor is dissolved. The stirrer is replaced by a stopper, the ice bath allowed to melt, and the mixture left to stand for 36 hours. The camphorsulfonic acid is collected on a suction filter and washed with ether. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator at room temperature, the nearly white crystalline product weighs 530–580 g. (38–42%). It melts at 202–203° with rapid decomposition and is relatively pure.
(B) Glutamic Acid.—To a solution of 36.7 g. (0.2 mole) of pure glutamic acid hydrochloride in 200 cc. of hot water is added 18.6 g. (0.2 mole) of aniline. The mixture, after heating for a few minutes on the steam bath, is cooled, treated with 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and allowed to stand overnight in the refrigerator. The crystalline glutamic acid is filtered off and washed with 95 per cent ethyl alcohol until free of chloride. It is then pure, and melts with decomposition at 211–213° (corr.). The yield and is 27–28 g. (92–95 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Ethyl α-bromobutyrate (58.5 g., 0.30 mole) is poured into a stirred mixture of 600 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), 36 g. of sodium nitrite (0.52 mole), and 40 g. of anhydrous phloroglucinol (0.32 mole) contained in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a sealed stirrer. The flask is closed, except for a tube containing calcium chloride, and immersed in a water bath maintained at room temperature. Stirring is continued for 2.5 hours; then the reaction mixture is poured into 1.2 l. of ice water layered over with 300 ml. of ether. After separation of the upper layer, the aqueous phase is extracted with four 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are washed with four 100-ml. portions of water and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The magnesium sulfate is removed by suction filtration and washed with four 25-ml. portions of ether which are combined with the filtered extract.
A. Isopropyl (E)-but-2-enoate (1) A 500-mL round-bottomed flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extractor containing magnesium sulfate (10 g) in a cellulose extraction thimble. Atop the extractor is a reflux condenser fitted with a rubber septum and an argon line. The flask is charged with crotonic acid (17.00 g, 197.5 mmol), isopropanol (106 mL, 1.39 mol), concentrated sulfuric acid (2.5 mL) and benzene (30 mL). The mixture is heated to reflux over the MgSO4 plug for 18 h and is then cooled to room temperature. Benzene (60 mL) is added, followed by the dropwise addition of a 10% aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (100 mL) while stirring. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, the layers are separated, and the aqueous portion is extracted with benzene (3 × 25 mL). The organic layers are combined, washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is evaporated under vacuum and the resulting yellow oil is purified by distillation (46–48 °C/25 mmHg) to give 17.98–18.00 g (71%) of isopropyl (E)-but-2-enoate (1) as a colorless oil.
B. trans-Stilbene oxide. To a magnetically stirred solution of trans-stilbene (0.724 g, 4.02 mmol) in 5 mL of acetone is added a solution of 0.062 M dimethyldioxirane in acetone (66 mL, 4.09 mmol) at room temperature. The progress of the reaction is followed by GLC, which analysis indicates that trans-stilbene is converted to the oxide in 6 hr. Removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a white crystalline solid. The solid is dissolved in dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (30 mL) and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. The drying agent is filtered off and washed with CH2Cl2. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. Remaining solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give an analytically pure sample of the oxide (0.788 g, 100% yield). Recrystallization from aqueous ethanol gives white plates/prisms, mp 69–70°C ((Note 12),).
Twenty-five grams (0.27 mole) of aniline is placed in the reaction flask, D, and 50 cc. of dry ether added as solvent. A second reaction flask is connected at C, in which is placed 5 g. of aniline, dissolved in 20 cc. of dry ether. This prevents the escape of ketene vapor at the beginning and at the close of the operation. In all, 85 cc. of acetone is passed through the apparatus, 39 cc. of which is recovered as distillate. Therefore, 44 cc. (or 35 g.) of acetone is decomposed. The duration of the run is about thirty minutes. Twenty-one grams of acetanilide, which corresponds to a yield of 25.8 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the amount of acetone decomposed, is isolated from the reaction mixture.
The solid is then allowed to cool, and the aluminum complex is decomposed by slowly adding first a mixture of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid with 300 cc. of water and then 500 cc. of water, whereupon a black oil collects at the surface. After standing overnight in the ice box, a large portion of this layer solidifies and can be separated by filtration. This solid (p-propiophenol) is recrystallized from 400 cc. of methyl alcohol. The yield is 129–148 g. (34–39 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a light yellow product melting at 145–147°. A second recrystallization raises the melting point to 147–148°.
The benzene is then removed by distilling from a steam bath, and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, any water which condenses with the forerun being separated. A special distilling flask with a fractionating side arm (p. 130) is best employed. The material which distils at 148–160° /25 mm., 133–143° /16 mm., or 120–130° /7 mm. weighs 430–470 g.; it solidifies to a crystalline mass on standing, and is pure enough for all practical purposes. On redistillation there is obtained 375–450 g. (65–78 per cent of the theoretical amount) of material boiling at 137–142° /16 mm. or 123–128° /8 mm., which solidifies on standing to crystals which melt at 40–42° and.
B. Ethyl diazoacetoacetate.3 A 2-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 26.0 g (0.20 mol) of ethyl acetoacetate, 49.0 g (0.20 mol) of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide and 1.5 L of acetonitrile. The reaction vessel is cooled in an ice bath, and 60.6 g (0.60 mol) of triethylamine is added to the stirring mixture in one portion. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is triturated with 500 mL of a 1:1 mixture of ether/petroleum ether. The mixture is filtered to remove the sulfonamide by-product, and the filtrate and wash are concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by chromatograpy on silica gel (130 g,) with ether/petroleum ether (1:4) as eluant to yield 28.5 g (91%) of ethyl diazoacetoacetate as a yellow oil.
The apparatus is flushed again with argon and allowed to warm to room temperature. During this period hydrogen gas evolves and a gray solid precipitates, which causes stirring to become difficult. At about 0°C the precipitate dissolves exothermally under strong evolution of hydrogen. The thermometer is replaced by a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and the solution is refluxed for 15 min and quenched by slow addition of 90 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid, without external heating. Tetrahydrofuran is removed under reduced pressure to yield the crude O-methylated compound in water.
B. (S)-2-Cyano-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (3). An oven-dried, three-necked, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with an argon inlet, septum, thermocouple and a stirring bar is charged with (S)-2-amido-pyrrolidine-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (2) (17.79 g, 71.7 mmol) and N,N-dimethylformamide (217 mL) under an argon atmosphere, which results in a clear, colorless solution. The solution is cooled in an ice/water bath for 20 min until an internal temperature of 2 °C is reached and cyanuric chloride (8.59 g, 46.6 mmol, 0.65 equiv) is then added in one portion. The reaction mixture is stirred at 4-6 °C (internal temperature) for 1 h, at which point the ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 45 min and is stirred for an additional 2.25 h. After complete consumption of the starting material (as monitored by thin layer chromatography, Note 18), the mixture is cooled to 5 °C using an ice-water bath and distilled water (200 mL) is added slowly. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with lithium chloride solution (10 wt % in distilled water, 3 × 200 mL, Note 20), then are dried (MgSO4, 18 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (24-40 °C, 30 mmHg) to give a colorless, viscous oil. Suction filtration through a pad of silica affords 16.22 g (97%) of 3 as a colorless oil, which turns to a milky, viscous oil upon storing in the refrigerator.
The combined distillate is separated from any phenol which may have settled out. It is washed four or five times with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the washings are almost colorless and then once with water. It is dried by shaking with crushed calcium chloride, and then distilled from a 2-l. flask through a short column at a fairly rapid rate. The first runnings may contain a little water and can be further dried. The product is a colorless liquid with an odor resembling that of benzene. The yield of fluorobenzene boiling at 84–85° is 780–870 g. (51–57 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The solution of potassium ethyl sebacate is poured into a 500-ml. tall beaker provided with a cooling coil, a thermometer, a stirrer, a platinum sheet anode 45–55 sq. cm. in area, and two platinum wire cathodes. To the solution 10 g. of monoethyl sebacate is added.
The solid ε-aminocaproic acid hydrochloride is dissolved in 1 l. of distilled water. This solution is passed through the column (downflow) and followed by at least 2 l. of distilled water.
A. exo-3,4-Dichlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene. A 1-l., four-necked, round bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a 500-ml., stoppered, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. After the addition of a solution of 52.5 g. (0.558 mole) of norbornene in 400 ml. of petroleum ether ((Note 2), b.p. 45–60°) to the flask, 112 g. (2.06 moles) of sodium methoxide is added, and stirring is begun. The flask is immersed in an ice–salt mixture before 349 g. (1.82 moles) of ethyl trichloroacetate is placed in the addition funnel and allowed to drip slowly into the stirred mixture at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above 0°. The addition requires about 4 hours, and the originally white reaction mixture becomes increasingly yellow in color. The mixture is stirred at a temperature below 0° for 4 hours before the temperature is allowed to rise gradually to room temperature overnight. The reaction mixture is poured onto 500 g. of crushed ice in 300 ml. of water. After the ice has melted, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is shaken with four 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer is neutralized with 10% hydrochloric acid and shaken again with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The original organic layer and the ether extractions are combined, washed with 300 ml. of a saturated solution of sodium chloride, dried for 6 hours over 20 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to about 200 ml. by distillation. The resulting product is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column, giving 72.5–87.0 g. (74–88%) of exo-3,4-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.1]oct-2-ene as a colorless liquid, b.p. 72–73° (0.9 mm.), nD25 1.5333 and.
A. Benzalbarbituric acid. A mixture of 128 g. (1 mole) of barbituric acid and 1250 ml. of water in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient stirrer and a reflux condenser is heated on a steam bath to effect solution. When the acid has dissolved, 115 g. (110 ml., 1.08 moles) of benzaldehyde is added while heating and stirring are continued. The solution rapidly fills with the insoluble benzalbarbituric acid. The mixture is heated for 1 hour on the steam bath to complete the reaction, and then is filtered by suction. The filter cake is washed with several portions of hot water and dried at 100°. The yield is 190–205 g. (88–95%) of product possessing a very pale yellow color. The substance melts at 254–256° and needs no further purification.
This product contains traces of ammonium chloride which may be removed by crystallization from water. When 100 g. of crude product is recrystallized from 400 cc. of water, about 80 g. of product is obtained. The recrystallized product melts at 119–120°.
B. (2-Carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide. To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is added methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate (25.90 g, 94.5 mmol) and 150 mL of chloroform. Triphenylphosphine (28.44 g, 108.4 mmol) is added in one portion and the resulting yellow solution is heated to reflux for 1.5 hr. After cooling to ambient temperature, the orange solution is poured into 400 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether with vigorous stirring to precipitate the Wittig salt. The slurry is cooled in a freezer (−20°C, 1 hr). The white solids are collected by filtration, washed with 4 × 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether, and dried under high-vacuum to give crude (2-carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide. A 1H NMR spectrum indicated that the product contained some triphenylphosphine, thus the salt was washed again with diethyl ether (2 × 100 mL). After drying, a considerably purer product (50.91 g) was obtained. The salt is used in the next step without further purification.
The resulting ε-aminocaproic acid is collected on a suction filter and dried in a desiccator. The yield of ε-aminocaproic acid melting at 201–203° is 52.5–53.5 g. (90–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 250-ml. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and an inlet for admission of nitrogen, is placed 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. With stirring, 27.1 g. (0.166 mole) of anhydrous ferric chloride is added in portions, followed by 4.7 g. (0.084 g. atom) of iron powder. The mixture is heated with stirring under nitrogen at the reflux temperature for 4.5 hours, giving a gray powder with a brown supernatant liquid.
A. α-(Bromomethyl)acrylic acid. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, fraction collector, cold-finger condenser, and two thermometers. Into the flask are placed 55.0 g (0.25 mol) of diethyl bis(hydroxymethyl)malonate and 142 mL (1.25 mol) of 47–49% hydrobromic acid. The mixture is then heated and the temperature of the liquid maintained between 85 and 90°C. A mixture of ethyl bromide and water distills during the course of 1.5–2 hr. The residue is then boiled for 10 hr, maintaining the temperature between 85–90°C. At the end of this period, the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 65–70°C (10–15 mm). About 100 mL of water is removed. The residue is cooled in the refrigerator overnight. Crystals of α-(bromomethyl)acrylic acid are filtered in the cold to give, after drying, 17.9 g (43%) of acid, mp 71–73°C.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a mercury-sealed stirrer is placed a solution of 46 g. (0.5 mole) of dry aniline in 125 ml. of pure dry benzene. Stirring is started, and a solution of 42 g. (0.5 mole) of ketene dimer (p. 508) in 75 ml. of pure dry benzene is added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux on the steam bath for 1 hour. After the major portion of the benzene has been removed by distillation from the steam bath, the remainder is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 500 ml. of hot 50% aqueous ethanol from which the acetoacetanilide separates on cooling. The mixture is cooled to 0° before filtration. A second crop of crystals can be obtained by adding 250 ml. of water to the mother liquor and cooling again. The total yield of product, m.p. 82–83.5°, is 65 g. (74%). Further purification by recrystallization from 300 ml. of 50% ethanol yields 55 g. of a product that melts at 84–85°.
A 1-l., three-necked flask is charged with 95 g. (0.36 mole) of triphenylphosphine and 500 ml. of anhydrous benzene, and fitted with a gas-inlet, a mechanical stirrer, and a condenser with attached drying tube. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, stirring is begun, and chlorine is introduced through the gas-inlet. Dichlorotriphenylphosphorane separates as a white solid or as a milky oil; the flow of chlorine is discontinued when the mixture develops a strong lemon-yellow color. The gas inlet is quickly replaced by an addition funnel, and a solution of 10 g. of triphenylphosphine in 60 ml. of benzene is added dropwise fairly rapidly. A solution of 24.5 g. (0.250 mole) of 1,2-epoxycyclohexane in 50 ml. of benzene is then added dropwise over ca. 20 minutes. The ice bath is replaced by a heating mantle, and the mixture, which consists of two liquid phases, is stirred and refluxed for 4 hours. It is then cooled, and excess dichlorotriphenylphosphorane is destroyed by the slow addition of 10 ml. of methanol. The mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator at ca. 100 mm., and the residue, which may be a white solid or a viscous oil, is triturated with 300 ml. of petroleum ether (30–60°). The solid triphenylphosphine oxide that separates is collected by suction filtration. The cake is thoroughly broken up with a spatula and washed with three 100-ml. portions of petroleum ether. The combined filtrates, from which a little more triphenylphosphine oxide precipitates, are refiltered, then washed with 250-ml. portions of aqueous 5% sodium bisulfite and with water. The organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated on a rotary evaporator at ca. 100 mm., and distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. There is very little forerun before 27–28 g. (71–73%) of cis-1,2-dichlorocyclohexane is collected at 105–110° (33 mm.), nD25 1.4977.
A. Indium(III) iodide . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added xylenes (500 mL). The solvent is degassed and the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser. Indium powder (5.00 g, 43.6 mmol) is added to the vigorously stirring solution, followed by iodine (I2, 16.57 g, 65.32 mmol). The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated at reflux (bath temp. ≈160-170°C) under argon for 1-1.5 hr or until the indium metal is consumed. When the metal is consumed, a crystal of iodine is added and stirring at reflux is resumed. The reaction is complete when the added iodine is not consumed after 15 min at reflux. The solution is filtered hot and allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting bright yellow crystals are filtered under nitrogen using a Schlenk filtration system and washed with two 10-mL portions of cold benzene to remove traces of I2. The filtrate is concentrated to 1/4-1/3 volume and cooled to 0°C. The yellow precipitate is Schlenk-filtered under nitrogen and washed with cold benzene (10 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure to yield 18.3 g (85%) of indium(III) iodide [In(III)I].
A 2-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying a Soxhlet extractor which in turn is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser. In the flask are placed 1190 g. (1500 cc., 20.5 moles) of commercial acetone and a few pieces of porous plate to produce even boiling. Two of the usual paper thimbles are placed in the extractor, one above the other. The lower one is filled nearly full of barium hydroxide; the top one is filled about three-quarters full of the same substance, and the remainder of the space is filled with glass wool.
A solution of 200 g. (3.6 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a separatory funnel. The stirrer is started, and to the hot solution 200 g. (0.92 mole) of ethyl sec.-butylmalonate is added slowly. The solution refluxes quietly owing to the heat of saponification. After all the sec.-butylmalonic ester has been added, the solution is boiled gently for two hours. It is then diluted with 200 cc. of water, and 200 cc. of liquid is distilled from the solution in order to remove all the alcohol formed during the saponification.
Four hundred grams (3.5 moles) of ethyl cyanoacetate (p. 254) is poured into 300 cc. (4.5 moles) of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) contained in a 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask. The mixture, which is cloudy at first, is shaken; it then warms up a little and becomes clear in about three minutes. The flask is allowed to stand one hour in an ice-salt mixture. The product is then filtered by suction and the solid washed with two 50-cc. portions of ice-cold ethyl alcohol. After drying in the air, the slightly yellowish, crystalline amide weighs 205–225 g. A snow-white product is easily obtained by crystallizing from hot alcohol and. For this purpose 200 g. of amide is dissolved in 350 cc. of hot 95 per cent alcohol and the solution cooled; pure amide is deposited with practically no loss.
To the crude mixture of ammonium bromide and β-bromopropionic acid, prepared as described on p. 131, from 317 g. of ethylene cyanohydrin, are added 1200 cc. of carbon tetrachloride and 200 cc. of the same solvent which has been shaken with the aqueous distillates; the ammonium bromide is filtered off and washed with 200 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The watery layer, amounting to about 350 cc., is separated and shaken with 100 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. To the united carbon tetrachloride solutions are added 450 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 10 g. of sulfosalicylic acid or phenolsulfonic acid to act as a catalyst.
A. N-Formyl-α,α-dimethyl-β-phenethylamine. To a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a sealed stirrer carrying a crescent-shaped blade, a thermometer, an addition funnel, and a reflux condenser connected to a trap containing 20% sodium hydroxide solution is added 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The contents of the flask are cooled to 20° by means of an ice bath, the addition funnel is temporarily replaced by a stopper, and to the stirred acetic acid is added 110 g. (2 moles) of 95% sodium cyanide in small portions. The temperature of the mixture is maintained around 20°, and the addition requires about 20 minutes. The addition funnel is replaced, and a previously prepared and cooled solution of 500 g. (272 ml., 4.9 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added slowly, with stirring, the temperature of the mixture being kept at about 20° by means of an ice bath. The ice bath is removed, and 300 g. (2 moles) of α,α-dimethyl-β-phenethyl alcohol is added over a 20-minute period during which the temperature of the mixture rises slowly to 35–45°. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 90 minutes and allowed to stand overnight. The amber-colored mixture containing some solid sodium sulfate is aerated with nitrogen for 2 hours (Caution! In a hood), poured into 3 l. of ice water, and the supernatant oil separated. The aqueous phase is neutralized with sodium carbonate and extracted with 600 ml. of ether. The ethereal extract is combined with the original oily supernatant, neutralized with sodium carbonate, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled to yield 230–248 g. (65–70%) of product, b.p. 137–141° (2 mm.). Redistillation of the ether-containing fore-run yields up to an additional 14 g. of material.
A. (2-Chlorobenzoyl)ferrocene. A thoroughly dried, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a funnel for the addition of air-sensitive solids, and a two-necked adapter holding a thermometer and a gas-inlet tube. Throughout the ensuing reaction the system is maintained under positive pressure of dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 18.6 g. (0.100 mole) of ferrocene, 17.5 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-chlorobenzoyl chloride, and 200 ml. of dichloromethane, and the addition funnel contains 14.0 g. (0.105 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. Stirring is begun, and the flask is immersed in an ice bath. When the solution has been chilled thoroughly, the aluminum chloride is added in small portions at such a rate that the reaction mixture remains below 5°. The appearance of a deep blue color indicates that the reaction is occurring. This addition requires about 20 minutes, and after its completion stirring is continued for 30 minutes with ice cooling and for 2 hours at room temperature.
A. 6,7-Dimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 54.0 g. (0.243 mole) of N-acetylhomoveratrylamine and 275 ml. of dry toluene. The mixture is stirred, warmed to 40°, and treated with 86.4 g. (52.5 ml., 0.572 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride, which is added over 1 hour. After addition, the reaction mixture is stirred at reflux for 2 hours, then cooled with an ice bath for 4 hours. The resulting crystals are collected by filtration and dried overnight at 50° in a vacuum oven, giving 79.0–79.5 g. of 6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline dichlorophosphate, m.p. 148–152°. This material is dissolved in 150 ml. of water, and the solution is treated with 100 ml. of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide. The oil which separates is drawn off, and the aqueous solution is washed with three 20-ml. portions of chloroform. These extracts and the oil are combined, washed with 15 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of chloroform with a rotary evaporator provides 47.0–48.0 g. (95–96%) of product, which is used without purification in Part B.
1,1'-Carbonyldiimidazole may be kept for a long period of time in either a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide or in a sealed tube. It is hydrolyzed by water to give carbon dioxide and imidazole.
Sixty-five grams (60 ml., 0.64 mole) of acetic anhydride is added to the warm, viscous, light-yellow syrup; the mixture is warmed slightly and is mixed by imparting a swirling motion to the flask until the solution is homogeneous. The flask is then fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper bearing an inlet tube and an exit tube, the former reaching within 5 mm. of the bottom. Dry hydrogen bromide is passed into the mixture, while it is cooled in an ice bath, until the gain in weight is 140–160 g.. The flask is then sealed with a rubber stopper and allowed to stand at 5° overnight.
A tared, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a vacuum take-off, and the entire assembly is connected through an adaptor containing a stopcock to an inverted cylinder of triethylaluminum, as shown in Figure 1. The assembly is connected to a nitrogen source through the vacuum take-off, and with the cylinder valve closed but the stopcock open, the system is alternately evacuated and filled with nitrogen four times. With the system filled with nitrogen the cylinder valve is opened and approximately 55 ml. (46 g; 0.40 mole) of triethylaluminum is allowed to flow into the reaction flask. The cylinder valve is then closed; the system is evacuated and filled three times with nitrogen, and the adaptor stopcock is then closed. The reaction flask is then quickly removed, stoppered, and weighed to determine the exact amount of triethylaluminum collected. A magnetic stirring bar is added and the flask is fitted with a vacuum take-off and 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The system is again placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and the triethylaluminum is dissolved in 150 ml. of anhydrous benzene, added through the dropping funnel. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 11.9 g. (0.441 mole) of hydrogen cyanide in 100 ml. of anhydrous benzene, which is added dropwise to the solution of triethylaluminum, with stirring and cooling. Preferably, the addition is carried out at a constant rate such that the hydrogen cyanide solution is added in about 2 hours. The evolution of ethane becomes slow suddenly after one molar equivalent of hydrogen cyanide is added. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir overnight.
(C) 1-Methylthiol-3-phthalamidopropane-3,3-dicarboxylic Acid.—A solution of 25 g. (0.066 mole) of the above ester in 30 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is heated on the steam bath in a 200-cc. round-bottomed flask, and 70 cc. of 5N sodium hydroxide is added. The cloudy liquid is heated until a sample gives a clear solution on dilution with water; this occurs after about two hours. The solution is then chilled to 0° and cautiously neutralized to Congo red with 0.2 N hydrochloric acid, whereupon 75 cc. of 5 N hydrochloric acid is slowly added, the temperature being maintained at 0°. The acid separates as colorless crystals. This separation is completed by the slow addition of 60 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The product is filtered by suction and washed free of salt with small quantities of ice-cold water. After drying in vacuo, the yield is 21.5–22 g. (95.5–98 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 141–143°.
D. 4-Methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, sodium salt (4). Sodium p-toluenesulfinate monohydrate (25.4 g, 0.13 mol. 1.0 equiv), sulfur (4.54 g, 0.14 mol. 1.09 equiv), ethanol (100 mL) and water (100 mL) are added to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar (3 x 1 cm). The flask is lowered into a heating mantle and fitted with a Liebig condenser. The mixture is stirred and warmed to reflux for 8 h. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, the residual sulfur is removed by filtration through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel into a 1-L round bottom flask, using water (2 x 20 mL) to wash the reaction flask and the collected solid. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 °C water bath, 70 mmHg) to wet solids (49 g). The flask is equipped with a PTFE stir bar (3 x 1 cm) and water (40 mL) is added. The slightly hazy mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The solution, which contains some suspended particles, is filtered into a 500-mL round bottomed flask through pad of pre-wetted Celite (3 g) in a 40-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, the flask and Celite pad being rinsed with water (4 x 10 mL). The clear filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (50 °C water bath, 70 mmHg) to provide a wet solid (32 g). The flask is equipped with a PTFE stir bar (3 x 1 cm) and a Liebig condenser. Absolute ethanol (80 mL) is added and the heterogeneous mixture is stirred and warmed to reflux over a 30 min period using a heating mantle. Once the mixture reaches reflux, the heating mantle is removed and the mixture is cooled in air to room temperature over the course of 1 h, then is stirred at room temperature for 3 h. The resulting white solid is collected on a 150-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel, portions of the filtrate being used to rinse all solids out of the flask. The filter cake is washed with absolute ethanol (25 mL), air-dried in the funnel by continued suction (ca 1 h) and then dried for 9 h in a vacuum oven (70 mmHg, 50 °C) to afford 4-methylbenzenesulfonothioic acid, sodium salt (22.4-23.4 g, 82-86 %).
A. (E)-2-Methyl-2-(2-phenylethenyl)-1,3-dithiolane. In a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed 29.2 g (0.2 mol) of (E)-4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one and 20.7 g (0.22 mol) of 1,2-ethanedithiol in 200 mL of methanol. To the stirred solution is added 11 mL (12.4 g, 0.087 mol) of boron trifluoride etherate. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 45 min. To the mixture is added 50 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide, and the methanol is removed under reduced pressure. Dichloromethane (300 mL) is introduced and the solution is washed with aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution (2 × 100 mL). The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 200 mL of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is fractionally distilled to give 24.9–27.1 g (56–61%) of (E)-2-methyl-2-(2-phenylethenyl)-1,3-dithiolane and as a yellowish liquid, bp 109–112°C (0.16 mm), that solidifies on standing, mp 52–53°C.
In a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a rubber-tube sealed mechanical glass stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask are placed 50 g. (0.28 mole) of anthracene and 750 ml. of commerical absolute ethanol. The suspension obtained is stirred and heated to 50°, and 75 g. (3.25 g. atom) of freshly cut sodium is added in quantities of about 10 g. each to the stirred mixture over a period of 5 minutes. The reaction mixture boils vigorously and stirring is continued for 15 minutes longer. The reaction mixture is then cooled and carefully diluted with 1 l. of water. The white-yellow solid which separates is a mixture of 9,10-dihydroanthracene and anthracene, and it is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 400 ml. of water, and dried in air.
To prepare the catalyst under methylcyclohexane, the catalyst, which has been prepared as above and washed free of alkali with water, but to which no ethanol has been added, is covered with 1 l. of methylcyclohexane which is distilled from an oil bath until all the water has been codistilled with the hydrocarbon, more of the methylcyclohexane being added from time to time so that the nickel always remains covered. When the catalyst is free from water it becomes freely suspended in the liquid.
B. 6-Hydroxynicotinic acid. In a 500-ml. beaker provided with a thermometer, magnetic stirring, and external cooling is placed 117 ml. of 14% ammonium hydroxide. With stirring, 45 g. (0.29 mole) of methyl coumalate is added over a period of 10 minutes, during which time the solution is kept below 20°. Stirring is continued for an additional 45 minutes at about 20°.
The lower reddish oily layer is separated, mixed with an equal volume of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and steam-distilled from a 2-l. flask until no more oil passes over. Towards the end of the distillation a yellow solid begins to collect in the receiver; this consists of nitro compounds, which are removed by vigorously stirring the oil for about three hours with 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 300 cc. of water, and 200 g. of iron filings in a 2-l. flask connected with a reflux condenser.
A mixture of 150 g. (0.82 mole) of benzophenone, one drop of glacial acetic acid, and 665 g. (850 cc., 11 moles) of isopropyl alcohol in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is warmed to 45°. The flask is closed with a tight cork firmly wired or tied in place, and is supported in an inverted position in a tripod and exposed to direct sunlight. After three to five hours of bright sunshine crystals of benzopinacol begin to appear; after eight or ten days of exposure, depending upon the intensity of the light, the flask is filled with crystals of benzopinacol. The solution is chilled in ice and the crystalline product is filtered with suction, washed with a small quantity of isopropyl alcohol, and allowed to dry in the air. The filtrate is reserved for subsequent reductions (see below). The yield of practically pure benzopinacol, m.p. 188–190°, is 141–142 g. (93–94 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is sufficiently pure for most purposes. It may be crystallized by dissolving it in 1 l. of hot benzene, filtering, and adding 400 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–100°) to the hot filtrate. After cooling in ice and filtering there is obtained 129–130 g. of purified product. The melting point is not changed by this purification.
The ester is hydrolyzed by heating under reflux for 1.5 hours with 50 ml. of 95% ethanol and 4.4 g. of 85% potassium hydroxide (0.066 mole) for each 10 g. (0.044 mole) of ester. Two-thirds of the ethanol is removed by distillation; then the residue is diluted with five volumes of water and acidified to Congo red with 5N sulfuric acid. The organic acid is extracted with two 150-ml. portions of petroleum ether, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The petroleum ether is removed from the extracts by flash distillation as described above, and the residual acid is distilled at reduced pressure through a 61-cm. Podbielniak-type column. The 2-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, distilling at 166–168°/3 mm., is obtained in 68–83% over-all yield (20–24.5 g. from 22–27 g. of ester) and, m.p. 28.5–32° to 29.5–32.4°, λmax 218 mμ, ε 12,900, in hexane, λmax 216–217 mμ, ε 12,800, in 95% ethanol.
3. Preparation of (S,S)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine·(D)-Tartrate The mother liquor from initial resolution is cooled to 0 °C and KOH pellets (80 g) are added slowly. The mixture is stirred vigorously at 0 °C for 10 min. To this solution is added diethyl ether (500 mL) and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 min. The aqueous layer is separated and then is extracted with diethyl ether (4 × 500 mL). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3), and then are concentrated under vacuum to give 48.4 g of a yellow oil. The oil is dissolved in H2O (150 mL), then (D)-(−)-tartaric acid (34.5 g, 230 mmol) and acetic acid (27.0 mL, 473 mmol) are added. The mixture is heated to 90 °C and the homogenous solution is allowed to cool to room temperature slowly before it is cooled in an ice bath. After the solid precipitates, the mixture is kept in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is filtered and the solid is washed with ice-cold water (10 mL), and then is dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 °C for 2 h to give 23.5 g of a light-yellow powder. The solid is dissolved in hot water (60 mL) and the solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature before it is placed in an ice bath for another 2 h. The precipitate is filtered, washed with 10 mL of ice-cold water, and dried under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg) at 80 °C for 2 h to give 20.16 g of white prismatic crystals. This recrystallization process is repeated using water (55 mL) to give 18.4 g (55% based on isomer content) of (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine·(D)-(−)-tartrate as white prismatic crystals.
At the end of the 24-hour period, the ethanol is removed under reduced pressure on a steam bath. A 2N sulfuric acid solution (2 l.) is added to the warm residue, and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 3–4 hours. The solid is removed by suction filtration and washed several times with water. The air-dried product is a pale-buff powder weighing 180–190 g., m.p. 126–128°. The solid is added to 1.5 l. of ethyl acetate, the mixture is heated to boiling and is filtered rapidly while hot. The filtrate is chilled, and it yields cream to pink-cream colored crystals of 2,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-cyclohexanedione, 160–168 g., m.p. 126.5–128.5°. The filtrate is concentrated to one-tenth of its original volume in order to obtain a second crop of crystals, 5–7 g., m.p. 121–125°. The total yield is 165–175 g. (64–68%).
B. N-Mesityl-N-(3-oxobutan-2-yl)formamide. An oven-dried, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with two rubber septa, a nitrogen inlet and a Teflon-coated stir bar is charged with 3-(mesitylamino)butan-2-one (16.4 g, 80 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and anhydrous THF (25 mL). Acetic formic anhydride (10.6 g, 120 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added in one portion to this solution, and the resulting mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 22.5 h. The resulting brown mixture is transferred to a 100-mL, one-necked flask and is concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 8 mmHg) to a volume of approximately 20 mL before it is added on top of a wet-packed silica gel column (diameter: 7 cm, height: 22 cm, pre-treated with hexanes/EtOAc, 4:1). The product is eluted with hexanes/EtOAc, 3:1) to give 14.34 g (77%) of N-mesityl-N-(3-oxobutan-2-yl)formamide as a white, crystalline solid.
After six hours, the solution is cooled to room temperature and a cold solution of 192 g. (4.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 350 cc. of water is poured down the side of the flask so that most of it settles to the bottom without mixing with the solution in the flask. The flask is then connected to a condenser for downward distillation and is shaken to mix the two layers. The resulting free amine separates. The flask is heated and the amine, together with some water, distils. The distillation is continued until no amine separates from a test portion of the distillate. There is a small quantity of an oily liquid left floating in the flask. This is probably an impurity from the diallylcyanamide.
4. Classification. Wash the resin (upflow) with 10 l. of distilled water.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 100 g. (0.62 mole) of p-nitrobenzyl cyanide (p. 396). A solution of 300 cc. (5.4 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 280 cc. of water is prepared, and two-thirds of this solution is poured onto the p-nitrobenzyl cyanide. The mixture is shaken well, until the solid is all moistened with the acid. Any solid material adhering to the walls of the vessel is now washed down into the liquid with the remainder of the acid; the flask is attached to a reflux condenser, then set, without shaking, over a 10-cm. hole in a large sheet of asbestos board which rests on a tripod, and heated until the mixture boils. The boiling is continued for fifteen minutes.
A. 1-Bromo-3-chloro-2,2-dimethoxypropane. In a good hood, a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser is charged with 300 ml. of anhydrous methanol, 111 g. (1.00 mole) of 2,3-dichloro-1-propene, and a few drops of concentrated sulfuric acid. With stirring, 178 g. (1.00 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide is added in small portions through the condenser. After the final addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for another hour at room temperature before 5 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added to neutralize the catalyst. The solution is stirred for an additional 15 minutes and poured into a large separatory funnel containing 300 ml. of water. The lower, organic layer is removed, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 500-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic extracts are washed twice with an equal volume of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated, giving a white semicrystalline mass, which is dissolved in refluxing pentane (250 ml.). The solution is cooled in an acetone–dry-ice bath for 30 minutes, yielding 89–99 g. (41–45%) of the white crystalline ketal, m.p. 69.5–70.5°.
A. 1-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)indoline. A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride-filled drying tube, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 113.5 g (0.52 mol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate and 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran. Through the dropping funnel, 59.6 g (0.50 mol) of indoline is added to the reaction mixture with stirring over 30 min which maintains a steady evolution of carbon dioxide(Note 2). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr followed by removal of the solvent with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to give 107.6–107.8 g of 1-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)indoline (98% yield) as a colorless oil, bp 83–84°C at 0.1 mm, which on standing solidifies, mp 42–45°C.
To 1 l. of milk, from which the cream has been largely separated, 0.05 M hydrochloric acid is slowly added, with stirring, through a capillary tube extending to the bottom of the beaker. The addition is continued until the solution attains a pH of 4.6. The end point is determined by withdrawing 5-cc. samples, diluting to 50 cc., adding methyl red, and matching against a buffered series. Approximately 1 l. of acid is required; the separation of the casein is practically complete at this point. Three liters of water is then added, stirring is discontinued, and the flocculent precipitate of casein is allowed to settle in the refrigerator for twelve to twenty-four hours. The clear supernatant liquid which contains soluble proteins and salts is removed as completely as possible by siphoning; the precipitate is collected on a suction funnel and washed with cold distilled water until the washings are free of calcium (give no precipitate with ammonium oxalate).
While the diazotization is in process, 68 g. (1.1 moles) of boric acid is dissolved in 133 g. (4 moles) of 60 per cent hydrofluoric acid in a beaker coated with paraffin-wax. The temperature is kept below 25° during the addition to avoid melting the paraffin-wax, and, after the addition, the solution is chilled in an ice-water bath.
When the addition of the nitric acid solution is complete, the reaction mixture is removed from the ice bath and allowed to stand at room temperature for two hours. The flask is then warmed, with shaking, to 50° on a water bath and maintained at that temperature for ten minutes. The cooled reactants are then poured slowly into 800 cc. of ice water and well stirred. About 40 g. of sodium chloride is added, and the aqueous layer is decanted and extracted with 200–250 cc. of a commercial grade of ether. The ethereal extract is added to the residual nitromesitylene, and this ethereal solution is washed with three or four 30-cc. portions of a 10–15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution until the water extract is distinctly alkaline. The ether is then distilled from a steam bath. The residue, after the addition of about 150 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, is steam-distilled until a test sample of the distillate is clear and free of oil drops. The steam distillation requires about three hours, during which time 1.5 l. of distillate is collected. The nitromesitylene settles to the bottom of the distillate. The water is decanted through a filter paper, and the residue is dissolved in 30 cc. of ether. The filter paper, if it contains any solid particles, is washed with 10 cc. of ether, and the two fractions are combined and placed in a 150-cc. distilling flask with a water-cooled receiver. After removal of the ether on a steam bath, the yellow residue is distilled with a free flame. All but 0.5 to 1.5 g. of material distils at 243–250°, and the distillate, which weighs 47 g., solidifies on cooling. The yellow crystalline product is purified by dissolving in 25 cc. of commercial methyl alcohol and cooling with stirring in a bath of ice and salt. The crystals are then filtered on a small Büchner funnel and washed twice with 5-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. From the wash alcohol, by exactly the same procedure, there is obtained 6–8 g. of crude crystals boiling at 243–249°. This material yields on crystallization 4 g. of pure nitromesitylene. The pure nitromesitylene, which has a light yellow color, melts at 43–44°. The yield is 41–42 g. (74–76 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The crude product is crystallized after treatment with activated carbon from ca. 1.5 l. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°) or 800 ml. of cyclohexane. From the orange-yellow solution 84 g. (69%) of 6-(dimethylamino)fulvene separates in yellow leaflets, m.p. 67–68°. Concentration of the filtrate and further recrystallization of the residue from petroleum ether or cyclohexane gives an additional 8 g. of product. The combined yield is 92 g. (76%).
In a 2-l. beaker equipped with a mechanical stirrer and immersed in an ice-salt bath is placed a solution of 75 g. (1.87 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 800 ml. of water. To the solution is added, with stirring, 95.8 g. (30.7 ml., 0.6 mole) of bromine. When the temperature of the solution reaches 0°, 60 g. (0.49 mole) of nicotinamide is added all at once with vigorous stirring. After being stirred for 15 minutes, the solution is clear. The ice-salt bath is replaced by a bath containing water at 75°, and the solution is stirred and heated at 70–75° for 45 minutes.
After all the ester-ketone mixture has been added and the reaction has subsided, the ice bath is removed and replaced by a steam bath. The crust on the mixture is broken up and the mixture heated on a steam bath until all the sodium has reacted (30–60 minutes). The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is poured with stirring onto 300 g. of crushed ice. Ninety-five milliliters of glacial acetic acid in 350 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes. The organic layer which separates is removed by means of a separatory funnel, and the water layer is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the original organic material, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. To the residue are added 150 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the solution is refluxed for 30 minutes, after which it is allowed to cool to room temperature.
The thermal decomposition may be conveniently carried out in a 2-l. distilling flask. A second distilling flask of 1-l. capacity is connected directly to the side arm of the first to serve as a receiver. Attached to the side arm of the receiver is a rubber tube arranged to lead the escaping gases over 2 l. of water in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The boron trifluoride dissolves in the water, and the other gases are led into a good hood. The p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate is placed in the decomposition flask and heated at its upper edge with a Bunsen flame. When the white fumes of boron trifluoride commence to appear, the flame is removed and the decomposition is permitted to proceed spontaneously. The heat is applied as necessary, and finally the flask is strongly heated to complete the decomposition and melt the solid. Some of the ethyl ester, b.p. 105–106°/25 mm., of p-fluorobenzoic acid is collected in the receiver, where it is carried by the gases, but the larger part is left in the decomposition flask. The ester is washed from the decomposition flask and the receiver with ether, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is refluxed for one hour on a steam bath with a solution of 56 g. (1 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 80 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 120 cc. of water. The solution is then filtered while still hot. The p-fluorobenzoic acid is precipitated by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid to the hot filtrate until the mixture is acid to Congo paper. After the mixture has cooled, the solid is filtered and allowed to dry. For purification, the p-fluorobenzoic acid is dissolved in a hot solution of 40 g. of potassium carbonate in 400 cc. of water; the solution is treated with Norite and filtered hot. Hydrochloric acid is added with stirring to precipitate the fluorobenzoic acid, which is then cooled, filtered, and dried.
B. Ethyl 4-hydroxy[1-13C]benzoate . A 100-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing addition funnel and a reflux condenser beyond the dropping funnel is charged with 20 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), 1.01 g (10.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv) of 4H-pyran-4-one, and 1.61 g (10.0 mmol, 1 equiv) of diethyl [2-13C]malonate . The condenser is sealed with a silica gel drying tube, and the stirred solution is put in an oil bath at 105°C. A solution of 0.22 g (2.0 mmol, 0.2 equiv) of potassium tert-butoxide in 20 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH) is added dropwise via the funnel during 20 min; the mixture turns red and turbid. After the mixture is heated under reflux for 15 hr, it is allowed to cool to room temperature. Water (30 mL) is added, followed by 5 mL of 2 M HCl. After removal of most of the solvent with a rotary evaporator, the aqueous mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water and brine (each 30 mL). Drying over Na2SO4, filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator affords the crude product. Flash chromatography on silica gel with ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (4:1) as eluent affords 1.34 g (8.01 mmol, 80%) of ethyl 4-hydroxy[1-13C]benzoate , mp 112-113°C.
The crude product is dissolved in 1 l. of boiling water, and the solution is filtered quickly through a preheated fritted-disk funnel. The filtrate is concentrated on a hot plate at atmospheric pressure to a volume of 550–600 ml. and allowed to stand at 0° overnight. The crystals are collected by filtration and dried at 85°, yielding 50.0–50.6 g. (70–71%) of 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione, m.p.210–211°.
During the latter part of the diazotization of the aminobenzaldehyde, a hot solution of cuprous chloride is prepared. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, 189 g. (0.75 mole) of powdered copper sulfate crystals and 161 g. of sodium chloride are dissolved in 600 cc. of hot water, and to this solution is added a solution of 41 g. (0.22 mole) of sodium metabisulfite (Na2S2O5) and 27 g. (0.67 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. The final temperature of the resulting cuprous chloride solution should be about 75°.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer is charged with 42 g. (1.1. moles) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 168 ml. of water. The contents of the flask are cooled to −20° and stirred vigorously as 48 g. (0.30 mole) of pyridinium-1-sulfonate, which has been previously chilled to −20°, is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred for 20 minutes while the temperature is kept below −5°. The cooling bath is removed, and the stirred mixture is warmed gradually to 20° over 20 minutes. The temperature of the dark orange mixture is then raised to 55–60°, but after 1 hour lowered again to −5°. The brown crystals that separate are filtered by suction, pressed into a compact filter cake, and washed with three 100-ml. portions of acetone, yielding 46–52 g. of crude product after drying on filter paper overnight or at 50° (1 mm.) for 1 hour.
B. tert-Butyl azidoformate. A 300-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a gas-inlet tube is dried in an oven, flushed with nitrogen, and allowed to cool while a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel. To the flask are added 120 ml. of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide and 8.1 g (0.10 mole) of powdered potassium azide. While a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel, the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes to dissolve the bulk of the potassium azide before 25.4 g. (0.100 mole) of tert-butylcarbonic diethylphosphoric anhydride is added dropwise with stirring. During this addition the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at approximately 25° with a water bath. The resulting solution is stirred at 20–25° for 1 hour; 120 ml. of water is then added dropwise while stirring and external cooling are maintained. The resulting mixture is extracted with three 120-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined pentane extracts are washed successively with 20 ml. of water and 20 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. After the pentane solution has been dried over magnesium sulfate, the pentane is removed at room temperature with a rotary evaporator. The residual crude product, 11–14 g. of a pale yellow liquid, is distilled under reduced pressure from a distilling flask heated in a water bath. Caution! This distillation should be conducted in a hood behind a safety shield.. The product is collected as 7.2–9.3 g. (50–65%) of colorless liquid, b.p. 57–61° (40 mm.), nD24 1.4224–1.4230.
B. α-Ketoglutaric acid. The ester obtained by the foregoing procedure is mixed with 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and left overnight. The mixture is concentrated by distillation until the temperature of the liquid reaches 140°. It is poured into an evaporating dish and allowed to cool. The solid mass, weighing 110–112 g., is then pulverized. The yield of α-ketoglutaric acid is 92–93% of the theoretical for the last step, or 75–77% based upon diethyl succinate. The light-tan product, obtained as described above, is suitable for most purposes, but a purer acid, m.p. 109–110° (cor.), may be obtained by recrystallization from an acetone-benzene mixture.
The reaction product is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the red oily layer is separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 60 ml. of benzene. The combined red oil and benzene extract are dried with 1–5 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The benzene is removed by distillation from a 50-ml. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. column. The flask is heated in an oil bath to a final temperature of about 150° to ensure removal of the last traces of benzene. The residue is distilled at 3 mm. and a bath temperature of 155°. A practically colorless fore-run of 1–1.5 g. comes over from 109° to 114°. This is followed by 15.5–16 g. of a very pale lemon-yellow liquid which boils at 114–115°. When the temperature of the thermometer in the flask starts to fall the bath temperature is raised to 170°, and an additional 1–1.5 g. of light lemon-yellow material is obtained. The total yield is 17.5–19 g. (76–82%) and.
(E)-2-Methyltetradeca-1,3-diene. Caution! tert-Butyllithium is extremely pyrophoric and care must be taken to avoid exposure to air at all times. A 2-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar and a rubber septum pierced by an argon inlet needle and an outlet needle. The flask, in which a positive flow of argon is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is flame-dried under argon, allowed to cool, and then charged by syringe with dry tetrahydrofuran (75 mL) and 2-bromopropene (6.24 mL, 70.2 mmol, 1.30 equiv). The solution is cooled to −78 °C (bath temperature) in a dry ice/acetone bath and then a 1.58 M solution of tert-butyllithium in pentane (89.2 mL, 140 mmol, 2.6 equiv) is added dropwise by syringe over 20 min in ten roughly equal portions. The resulting bright-yellow suspension is stirred for 10 min at −78 °C, then an additional portion of 2-bromopropene (0.65 mL, 7.3 mmol, 0.14 equiv) is added dropwise over 7 min. The resulting pale-yellow suspension is stirred for an additional 30 min at −78 °C (during which time the preparation of the lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LTMP) solution is initiated) and is warmed to 0 °C by transfer into an ice bath for 10 min. The resulting pale-yellow solution is re-cooled to −78 °C (bath temperature).
(A) Dibenzoylhydrazine.—In a 2-l. flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in a bath of cold water, are placed a solution of 48 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine sulfate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 309). With stirring, 145 g. (120 cc., 1.03 moles) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride and 120 cc. of an aqueous solution containing 45 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added slowly from separate dropping funnels. The benzoyl chloride is added over a period of one and one-half hours; the alkali is added slightly faster. After both additions are completed the mixture is stirred for two hours longer and then saturated with carbon dioxide. The dibenzoylhydrazine is filtered with suction, pressed thoroughly, and ground to a paste with 50 per cent aqueous acetone. The material is filtered with suction, washed with water, and pressed as dry as possible. The crude product is dissolved in about 650 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid, from which, on cooling, the dibenzoylhydrazine separates as a mass of fine white needles. These are filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried by heating under reduced pressure on a water bath, in a slow current of air. This first fraction, m.p. 234–238°, amounts to 80–90 g. (66–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is practically pure. Small quantities of less pure material can be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor.
A. (Z)-β-Bromostyrene. In a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed 30.8 g (0.100 mol) of erythro-α,β-dibromo-β-phenylpropionic acid, 13.0 g (0.200 mol) of sodium azide, and 500 mL of dry N,N-dimethylformamide. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 8 hr and poured into a mixture of 300 mL of ether and 300 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, washed with three 100-mL portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. After evaporation of the filtrate with a rotary evaporator, the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, giving 13.5–13.9 g (74–76%) of (Z)-β-bromostyrene, bp 54–56°C (1.5 mm).
The flask is allowed to cool, and 920 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The unchanged salicylic acid is then steam-distilled from the mixture. The flask is strongly heated, so that its contents are concentrated and, towards the end of the distillation, sodium chloride begins to precipitate. The removal of salicylic acid is practically complete when about 10–12 l. of distillate has come over, although the distillate still gives a ferric chloride test for salicylic acid. The solution in the flask is allowed to cool overnight and is finally chilled in an ice bath.
Hinsberg separation. To this solution, which should be cold (5–8°), is now added 23 g. of benzenesulfonyl chloride,3 and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. The separatory funnel is replaced by a stopper bearing a thermometer, and the contents of the flask are warmed to 40° and stirred until the odor of the acid chloride is no longer noticeable. This usually requires about 30 minutes. The 1-n-butylpyrrolidine is separated from the non-volatile di-n-butylbenzenesulfonamide by steam distillation, the amine being collected in dilute acid as before. The acid solution is then evaporated to dryness, and the amine is liberated by adding 20% sodium hydroxide solution until the aqueous layer turns red litmus blue. The amine is extracted by one 200-ml. portion of ether, and the ethereal solution is dried over 15–20 pellets of potassium hydroxide. After the ether has been distilled from the decanted solution, the residue is distilled from an oil bath. The yield of 1-n-butylpyrrolidine boiling at 154–155°/758 mm. is 44–51 g. (70–80%); nD27 1.437.
Purification of the crude iodoxybenzene is effected by grinding it to a powder in a mortar, macerating it with 70 ml. of chloroform, and separating the solid by filtration. The chloroform extraction is repeated and the solid is dried; weight 17–19 g. (72–80%); purity 99.0–99.9% by iodometric titration.3
To a solution of 312 g. (3 moles) of sodium bisulfite in 750 ml. of water in a 3-l. beaker is added 225 ml. of a 37–40% formaldehyde solution, and the mixture is warmed to 60°. After cooling to 35°, 219 g. (309 ml., 3 moles) of diethylamine is added with hand stirring, and the mixture is allowed to stand for 2 hours. The beaker containing the reaction mixture is placed under a good hood, and to it is added a solution of 147 g. (3 moles) of sodium cyanide dissolved in 400 ml. of water with efficient stirring so that the two layers are thoroughly mixed. After 1.5 hours the upper nitrile layer is separated and dried over 25 g. of Drierite; it weighs 299–309 g. (90–92%). The crude product is purified by distillation; the portion boiling at 61–63°/14 mm., n25D 1.4230, amounts to 298–302 g. (88–90%).
The greenish yellow plates, which separate as the solution is cooled to room temperature, are filtered, washed 3 times with 150- to 200-ml. portions of water, and air-dried. The filtrate and first washings are combined and heated, 10 g. of picric acid is added, and the mixture is cooled and filtered. This process is repeated, using 10-g. portions of picric acid, until the air-dried picrate fraction so obtained melts below 195°.
The crude reaction mixture is filtered and the filtrate is reserved. The solids are triturated by stirring vigorously with 100 mL of methanol for 20 min with gentle warming to about 40°C. The solids are filtered and triturated again in the same way. The three organic filtrates are combined and concentrated to near dryness. The resulting semi-solid is redissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane, filtered to remove residual ammonium chloride, and concentrated to a light brown solid, 18.9 g. The crude product is dissolved in 60 mL of boiling tetrahydrofuran and allowed to crystallize in a −6°C freezer overnight. The amide is collected by filtration, washed with 5 mL of cold ether, and dried under reduced pressure, giving 15.77 g of white flakes, mp 128–129°C. The filtrate is concentrated to about 8 mL, brought to the cloud point by the addition of a few drops of hexane, and cooled in the freezer. Filtration as before gives a second crop of white flakes, 1.46 g, mp 128–129°C (total yield 17.23 g, 90.6%).
B. Ethyl 5-chloro-3-phenylindole-2-carboxylate . An oven-dried, two-necked, round-bottomed, 500-mL flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a glass stopper, and a reflux condenser connected to the argon line is flushed with argon. The flask is charged with N-(2-benzoyl-4-chlorophenyl)oxalamic acid ethyl ester (13.27 g, 40 mmol), titanium(III) chloride (TiCl3) (12.34 g, 80 mmol), zinc dust (10.45 g, 160 mmol,), and ethylene glycol dimethyl ether (DME) (250 mL,). The resulting suspension is heated at reflux for 2 hr with stirring, during which time a characteristic color change from violet (TiCl3) to blue to black occurs. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature and then slowly filtered through a short pad of silica on a sintered glass funnel. The inorganic residues are thoroughly washed with ethyl acetate (5 × 50 mL ,), and the combined filtrates are concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. For purification, the crude product is refluxed in toluene (120 mL,), and the resulting yellow solution is decanted from the oily residues. The product crystallizes upon standing at ambient temperature. The precipitated needles are collected on a funnel, washed with cold hexane (3 × 10 mL), and dried under reduced pressure to afford a first crop of ethyl 5-chloro-3-phenylindole-2-carboxylate as pale-yellow needles (9.3-9.7 g, 78-81%). Evaporation of the filtrate and recrystallization of the residue from toluene (20 mL) as described above gives a second fraction of product (0.8-1.4 g, 7-12%).
C. Excess 1 is destroyed by adding 22 mL (0.3 mol) of freshly distilled propionaldehyde and stirring for 1 hr at room temperature. Liberated α-pinene is then removed by vacuum. Tetrahydrofuran, 200 mL, is added, followed by 150 mL of 3 M aqueous NaOH. Hydrogen peroxide (150 mL, 30%) is added dropwise (see Caution in). Oxidation is complete in 3 hr at 40°C. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and extracted with three 50-mL portions of ethyl ether. The ether layers are combined and dried with copious amounts of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to give an oil. Distillation at 60–65°C (3.0 mm) yields 31 g (0.245 mol) of 1-octyn-3-ol, 86% yield. The distillation pot residue is a thick oil consisting for the most part of cis-1,5-cyclooctanediol. An NMR lanthanide shift study showed the alcohol to be 93% (R) and 7% (S), 86% e.e. and.
The crude product is transferred to a 2-l. flask and mixed thoroughly with 200 g. of powdered calcium carbonate. About 300 cc. of water is added and the mixture is heated cautiously and then refluxed for fifteen hours to effect hydrolysis. The product is then distilled in a rapid current of steam; the distillate is collected in 500-cc. portions and cooled; and the p-bromobenzaldehyde is collected and dried in a desiccator. From the first liter of distillate 50–60 g. of p-bromobenzaldehyde melting at 55–57° is obtained. An additional 15–20 g. of product melting at 50–56° is obtained in about 2 l. more of distillate. This may be purified through the bisulfite addition compound and yields 13–18 g. of product melting at 55–57°. The total yield of pure aldehyde is 65–75 g. (60–69 per cent of the theoretical amount).
D. 3-Acetylamino-1-ethoxythiocarbonylsulfanyl-4,4,4-trifluorobutyl acetate (4). A flame-dried, 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper and a condenser connected to the argon line. The flask is charged with xanthate 3 (12.4 g, 47.5 mmol), vinyl acetate (5.1 mL, 54.6 mmol) and 1,2-dichloroethane (50 mL) and the resulting solution is heated under reflux in an oil bath for 15 min under argon. Four equal portions of lauroyl peroxide (473 mg each, 1.9 g overall, 10 mol%) are added in intervals of 1.5 h to the refluxing solution. After 7 h under reflux, the solution is allowed to reach ambient temperature before the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure to give adduct 4 as a pale yellow oil (17.8 g), which was used in the next step without further purification.
A. cis- and trans-4-Aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid. A mixture of 27.4 g. (0.20 mole) of p-aminobenzoic acid, 200 ml. of water, and 2 g. of 10% rhodium-0.1% palladium on carbon catalyst is placed in a pressure bottle and hydrogenated at 50 p.s.i. When 0.6 mole of hydrogen has been absorbed, the mixture is filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure until crystals start to form. The mixture is diluted with 200 ml. of dimethylformamide and cooled to 5°, filtered, washed with dimethylformamide, then methanol, and dried, giving 19.4–20.3 g. (68–71%) of cis- and trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid, m.p. 292–296°.
A. 2,4-Dinitrophenyl benzyl sulfide. The apparatus consists of a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. In it are placed 202 g. (1.00 mole) of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (m.p. 50–52°) (Caution! A skin irritant), 400 ml. of methanol, 124 g. (1.00 mole) of benzyl mercaptan, and 87 g. (85 ml., 1.10 moles) of pyridine. The mixture is heated at the reflux temperature with stirring for 16 hours or more and cooled to 0°. The 2,4-dinitrophenyl benzyl sulfide that precipitates is separated by filtration, washed with two 250-ml. portions of ice-cold methanol, and dried at 60–80°. The sulfide, a yellow crystalline solid that melts at 128–129°, weighs 235–250 g. (81–86%). It may be used in the next step without further purification.
A. 6,7-Dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-2-[(1-tert-butoxy-3-methyl)-2-butyliminomethyl]isoquinoline (2). In a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask 10.0 g (51.7 mmol) of 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline 1 is combined with 11.5 g (53.7 mmol) of (S)-N,N-dimethyl-N'-(1-tert-butoxy-3-methyl)-2-butylformamidine, 50 mL of dry toluene, and 50 mg of (+)-camphorsulfonic acid. The mixture is heated to reflux for 24 hr and allowed to cool to room temperature. Approximately 30 mL of toluene is removed by rotary evaporation and the residual solution is heated at reflux for an additional 2 days. After the reaction mixture is cooled, it is diluted with 50 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide and 100 mL of brine and the organic layer is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residue is distilled (Kugelrohr 0.1 mm, 170°C bath temp.) to give 18.0 g (96%) of 2 as a pale-yellow oil.
In a tared 1-L, three-necked flask, two necks of which are covered with rubber septa and the other connected to a nitrogen-vacuum source, is placed 17.2 g of zinc chloride. The flask is evacuated to approximately 2 mm and heated with a burner with swirling until practically all of the salt melts. The flask is cooled and filled with nitrogen. The dried salt weighs 16.4–17 g (ca. 0.12 mol). An efficient magnetic stirring bar and a Dimroth condenser in place of a rubber septum are set in position, and the flask is again flushed with nitrogen. Ether (300 mL) is introduced via the septum, and stirring is initiated and maintained throughout the reaction. The mixture is refluxed gently for 1 hr to aid dissolution of the solid state. The flask is cooled, and 1-trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxycyclopropane (41.80 g, 0.24 mol) is introduced with the aid of a hypodermic syringe during 5 min. The cloudy mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr; the more dense lower layer may have mostly disappeared at this point. The mixture is refluxed for 30 min to complete homoenolate formation. The clear, colorless solution of the zinc homoenolate and chlorotrimethylsilane is cooled in an ice bath, and cuprous bromide/dimethyl sulfide complex (0.4 g, 2 mmol) is added by removing the septum while nitrogen adequate to exclude air is introduced through the inlet. 2-Cyclohexen-1-one (9.62 g, 0.1 mmol) is introduced via the septum during 1 min, and then hexamethylphosphoric triamide (HMPA) (34.8 mL, 0.2 mol) and is added during 5 min. A slightly exothermic reaction occurs initially and the bath is removed after 20 min. After 3 hr at room temperature, 40 g of silica gel and 300 mL of dry hexane are added while the mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 min. The supernatant liquid is decanted, and the residue is suspended in 60 mL of dry ether. Dry hexane (60 mL) is added and the supernatant liquid is decanted. This extractive procedure is repeated once and the combined organic phase is filtered through Celite. After concentration with a rotary evaporator, the oily product is distilled under reduced pressure (ca. 2 mm). 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-1-ethoxycyclopropane (8–10 g) is recovered as the first fraction (bp 26°C at 2.3 mm). The majority of the HMPA remaining after workup distils at 80–120°C/2.3 mm. Finally, the desired product (18.9–20.5 g, 70–76%) is obtained as a fraction boiling at 130–132°C/2.3 mm.
In order to secure a pure product the above material is dissolved in 175 cc. of tetrachloroethane by boiling and the solution is boiled under reflux for fifteen minutes with 12 g. of decolorizing carbon, and then filtered by suction into an Erlenmeyer flask, the charcoal being washed with about 50 cc. of hot solvent. The filtrate is kept hot, treated with 750 cc. of boiling alcohol, and set aside to crystallize. The benzanthrone separates as pure yellow needles melting at 170–171°; yield, 48–52 g. (60–65 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The cold solution is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and is placed in an ice bath. To the stirred solution is added slowly 56 g. (0.5 mole) of melted 1,2-cyclohexanedione. Precipitation of the 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime should take place almost immediately. If not, the solution may be seeded to initiate rapid precipitation. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes after the addition of the 1,2-cyclohexanedione, and the precipitate is then collected on a 5-in. Büchner funnel. The precipitate is thoroughly washed with water to remove inorganic salts. The 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime is partially dried by suction and finally dried in a vacuum desiccator to give snow-white crystals; yield 52.5 g. (74%); m.p. 185–188° (darkening at 170°). The crude 1,2-cyclohexanedione dioxime is recrystallized from 550 ml. of water using 2.5 g. of iron-free Norit; yield 39.3 g. (55%); m.p. 186–188°.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer; the third neck of the flask is fitted with a 50-ml., pressure-equalizing addition funnel, carrying a drying tube attached to a gas trap. The flask is charged with 200 ml. of dry nitrobenzene, followed by 43 g. (0.32 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. After the aluminum chloride has dissolved, 39.5 g. (0.250 mole) of finely ground 2-methoxynaphthalene (nerolin,) is added. An ice bath is used to cool the stirred solution to about 5° before 25 g. (23 ml., 0.32 mole) of redistilled acetyl chloride is added dropwise over a 15–20 minute period, with stirring and at a rate which holds the temperature between 10.5 and 13°. After addition of the acetyl chloride is complete, the flask is kept immersed in the ice water while stirring is continued for 2 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand at room temperature for at least 12 hours.
A filtered solution of 200 g. (3.7 moles) of ammonium chloride in 500 cc. of water is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath and cooled to 5–10°. A solution of 175 g. (3 moles) of acetone in 500 cc. of ether is added with stirring. Then a solution of 160 g. (3.2 moles) of sodium cyanide in 350 cc. of water is added, with stirring, at such a rate that the temperature never exceeds 10°.
A. O-Diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine.2 A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, drying tube, an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a nitrogen-inlet tube, is charged with 300 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride, 16.5 g (0.5 mol) of hydroxylamine base, and 1.0 g of dry sodium bicarbonate. While the suspension is stirred vigorously at −30°C (bath temperature), a solution of 52.06 g (0.22 mol) of diphenylphosphinyl chloride in 70 mL of anhydrous methylene chloride is added under a nitrogen atmosphere at a constant rate within 30 min. The resulting thick suspension is stirred at −30°C for 2 hr and for an additional 2 hr after the cooling bath is removed. The reaction mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3) and the residue is washed with two 80-mL portions of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride is removed from the colorless solid by a stream of air for 2 hr. The dry solid, still on the funnel, is then mixed thoroughly with 200 mL of deionized water. The water is removed by suction. The same operation is performed sequentially with 150 mL of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then with two 150-mL portions of water. This solid, which retains water tenaciously, is dried by suction and by pressing down on the funnel for several hours, followed by drying in a phosphorus pentoxide-charged vacuum desiccator until its weight is constant (24 hr) to give 36 g (70%) of impure O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine, mp 120–135°C, with decomposition.
After addition is complete, 300 ml. of xylene is added and the distillation continued until the vapor temperature rises again to 138°. During that time an additional 250 ml. of distillate is collected, leaving a white suspension to which 18 ml. of dimethylsulfoxide is added. A solution of 100 g. (0.633 mole) of ethyl 4-oxohexanoate in 200 ml. of xylene is then added to the vigorously stirred sodium methoxide suspension over 25 minutes, while 900 ml. of distillate is collected continuously, maintaining the vapor temperature at 134–137°. The orange-colored mixture is stirred and heated for an additional 5 minutes, then cooled to room temperature. Addition of 165 ml. of water with vigorous stirring over a 5-minute period gives two clear phases, which are cooled in an ice bath and acidified by adding 82 ml. (0.98 mole) of 12 N hydrochloric acid with vigorous stirring. After the mixture is stirred at 0° for another 1.5 hours, the crystalline product is collected by suction filtration and carefully washed successively with 100-ml. and 50-ml. portions of ice-cooled diethyl ether.
B. Trimethylene dithiotosylate. To 150 ml. of 95% ethanol containing 10–20 mg. of potassium iodide is added 40 g. (0.18 mole) of potassium thiotosylate and 20 g. (0.10 mole) of 1,3-dibromopropane (trimethylene dibromide). The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 8 hours in the dark and under nitrogen. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature, diluted with an equal volume of cold water, and agitated. After decantation of the supernatant liquid, the residual honeylike layer of product is washed with three 200-ml. portions of cold water, once with 100 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and once with 100 ml. of cold absolute ethanol. The crude product is dissolved in 10 ml. of acetone, diluted with 80 ml. of hot absolute ethanol, and stirred under nitrogen at 0°. The oil which separates is redissolved by the addition of a minimum amount (ca. 5 ml.) of acetone. Seed crystals are introduced, and the mixture is stirred for 1 hour at 0° under nitrogen and stored at −30° for several hours. The microcrystalline product is collected by filtration and weighs 20.2 g., m.p. 63.5–65.0°. Three recrystallizations from nine parts (180 ml.) of ethanol give 17.2 g. (41%) of white needles, m.p. 66–67°. During the recrystallizations some of the material oils out when the solution is cooled to room temperature. The supernatant liquid is decanted, seeded, and stored at −30° for several hours. The oil is not further purified. The recrystallized material is chemically pure for further use [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 590 (1988)].
This material is sufficiently pure for most purposes. If a purer product is desired, the crude material is dissolved in 300 ml. of dimethylformamide, 10 g. of activated alumina (48–100 mesh) is added, and the mixture is filtered. The filtrate is heated to 80–90° on a steam bath, then 1 l. of boiling water is added immediately. The resultant mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the light buff crystals of 2,5-diamino-3,4-dicyanothiophene that separate are collected on a Büchner funnel and thoroughly washed with 500 ml. of acetone; weight 26–28 g. (79–85%). The product has no definite melting point but sublimes with some decomposition when heated above 250°.
B. Diethyl acetamidomalonate. The solution of diethyl isonitrosomalonate described above, 86 g. (0.842 mole) of acetic anhydride, and 225 ml. (3.95 moles) of glacial acetic acid are placed in a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. With vigorous stirring 78.5 g. (1.20 moles) of zinc dust is added in small portions over a period of 1.5 hours in such a manner that the temperature of the reaction is maintained at 40–50°. The reaction is markedly exothermic during most of the zinc addition, and intermittent cooling (water bath) is required. After all the metal has been added, the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes.
The tarry solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 50 ml. of water, and dried. The dried solid is pulverized and boiled under reflux for 3 hours with 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 90–100°). The hot mixture is then filtered (fluted filter paper), and the solid is discarded. The filtrate is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the 2-bromo-3-methylbenzoic acid is collected by filtration. The white acid when dry weighs 7.5–8.5 g. (7–8%, based on the p-nitrotoluene) and melts at 134–136°.
In a pressure bottle are placed 19.6 g. (0.1 mole) of benzophenone hydrazone, 22 g. (0.1 mole) of yellow oxide of mercury, and 100 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°). The bottle is closed, wrapped in a wet towel, and shaken mechanically at room temperature for 6 hours. The mixture is then filtered to remove mercury and any benzophenone azine, and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure at room temperature. The crystalline residue of diphenyldiazomethane melts when its temperature reaches that of the room, but it is difficult to purify and this product is pure enough for all practical purposes. The material weighs 17.3–18.6 g. (89–96%). The product should be used immediately.
The crude product is dissolved in boiling ethyl acetate (600 mL) in a 1-L flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar; then hexane (230 mL) is added. A few minutes after cessation of heating, a white solid starts to precipitate. The suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, then is cooled for an additional hour with an ice bath. The solids are collected, washed with ice-cold hexane (100 mL), and dried under high vacuum (0.1 mbar) at room temperature for 12 hr to give purified 2 (77.1 g, 72%) as a white solid. The mother liquor is concentrated under reduced pressure (to 220 g) and hexane (150 mL) is added. A few minutes after the addition of hexane, colorless crystals start to form. After standing for several hours at room temperature, the crystals are collected, washed with ice-cold hexane (100 mL) and dried as described above to yield a second crop of 2 (12.5 g, 12%). A third crop (11.3 g, 11%) is obtained after concentration (to 70 g) and treating of the mother liquor as described above.
This operation, which removes the excess of toluene, may be carried out in the same flask and loss by transfer thus avoided. The aqueous solution of aluminum chloride and hydrochloric acid, after thorough cooling, is decanted through a suction filter, the residue washed with a little cold water, and that collected on the filter returned to the flask. This residue consists almost solely of p-toluyl-o-benzoic acid, partly crystalline, partly in oily lumps.
A. 2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate (1). The center neck of a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer port, magnetic stirrer bar coated with Teflon, and heating mantle is fitted with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The two side necks are fitted with 7 cm (diam) × 27 cm dry ice condensers vented through oil-filled bubblers into traps containing aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide. A thermometer is placed in the thermometer port to extend nearly to the bottom of the flask without contacting the stirrer bar. The apparatus is purged with dry nitrogen, the nitrogen flow is stopped, and to the flask are added 300 g (2.5 mol) of pivaloyl chloride and 46 g (0.62 mol) of anhydrous tert-butyl alcohol. The condensers are charged with isopropyl alcohol-dry ice and, with stirring, the reaction mixture is warmed to 85°C. Heating is discontinued, and the mantle is allowed to remain in place. Then 187.5 g (109 mL, 1.25 mol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is added with stirring during a period of 2–3 min. After the addition is complete, the temperature is maintained at 95–105°C for 10 min with the heating mantle. The mantle is removed, and the brown reaction mixture is first allowed to spontaneously cool to 50°C and finally cooled to −10°C with an isopropyl alcohol-dry-ice bath. On addition of 1 L of cold diethyl ether, a precipitate forms immediately and is collected, washed with three 300-mL portions of diethyl ether, and air-dried on a medium-porosity fritted-glass filter to give 118–137 g (53–62%) of light tan 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyrylium trifluoromethanesulfonate, mp 153–164°C.
A. Ethyl N-(2-methyl-3-nitrophenyl)formimidate. A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a Claisen condenser protected from moisture with a drying tube, is charged with 200 g (1.35 mol) of freshly distilled triethyl orthoformate, 1 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid and 152 g (1 mol) of 2-methyl-3-nitroaniline and. The solution is heated to 120°C and all of the ethanol formed is continuously distilled off during ca. 1 hr. Fractional vacuum distillation of the residue gives at 156–158°C/6 mm, the imidate ester, 184 g (88%), as a light-yellow, solidifying oil, mp 57–58°C.
C. Ethyl 1-hydroxycyclohexylacetate. A solution of 24.6 g. (0.250 mole) of cyclohexanone in 25 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise to the reaction mixture over a 10-minute period. After an additional 5 minutes, the reaction mixture is hydrolyzed by adding 75 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid in one portion. The cooling bath is removed, and the stirred solution is allowed to reach room temperature.
A. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a septum-capped sidearm, magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, and stopcock adapter connected to a mercury bubbler is flame-dried while being flushed with nitrogen. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained during the procedure through the oxidation step. After the apparatus is cooled, it is charged, via a double-ended needle,2 with 800 mL of a 0.5 M tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution of 9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane (9-BBN, 0.4 mol,). Then 61.3 g (71.5 mL, 0.45 mol) of ( + )-α-pinene is added. After the solution is refluxed for 4 hr, the excess α-pinene and THF are removed by vacuum to provide a thick clear oil of neat B-3-pinanyl-9-borabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, 1.
A solution of 6.6 g. (0.10 mole) of malononitrile in 8.7 g. (0.11 mole) of pyridine and 25 ml. of water is prepared in a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and stirred mechanically (no stirrer seal required) as there is added rapidly in small portions a total of 12.8 g. (0.10 mole) of powdered recrystallized tetracyanoethylene. The resulting mixture is warmed on a hot plate as stirring is continued until complete solution occurs (5–10 minutes,). The hot dark solution is poured into a swirled solution of 12.1 g. (0.11 mole) of tetramethylammonium chloride in 500 ml. of water. The resultant mixture is heated almost to boiling to give a dark-red solution, which is then allowed to cool spontaneously to room temperature. After final cooling in an ice bath, the orange needles of tetramethylammonium 1,1,2,3,3-pentacyanopropenide are collected by suction filtration and washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water. This product is dissolved in 500 ml. of hot water, decolorized with about 5 g. of activated carbon, and allowed to crystallize as described above. The yield of bright yellow-orange needles, m.p. 314–315°, is 19.5–20.5 g. (81–85%).
C. α-Bromoheptaldehyde. A mixture of 119.5 g. (100 ml., 0.5 mole) of α-bromoheptaldehyde dimethyl acetal and 80 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is boiled gently in a 250-ml. distilling flask, and the methanol liberated is removed by distillation, which is continued slowly until the vapor temperature reaches 90°, at which point the heating is stopped and the residue and distillate are combined and diluted with 200 ml. of water. The somewhat brownish oil which separates is distilled under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask. The yield of pure α-bromoheptaldehyde, boiling at 87–92°/17 mm., nD25 1.4580–1.4600, d425 1.210–1.230, is 87–92.5 g. (90–95%).
A 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser is charged with 13.3 g. (0.0522 mole) of 2-(diphenylmethoxy)-N,N-dimethylethylamine and 50 ml. of acetone. The solution is stirred, and 8.1 g. (0.057 mole) of methyl iodide in 15 ml. of acetone is added dropwise over 5 minutes. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes, then cooled to 0–10° with an ice bath. The crystalline product is filtered and washed with 15 ml. of acetone and 30 ml. of diethyl ether, yielding 20.0–20.2 g. (97–98%) of colorless, crystalline methiodide, m.p. 194–196°.
The mixture is allowed to stand for one week and the precipitate filtered, washed with cold water until free of chlorides, and dried at 40–50°. The yield is 246–315 g. The product is found on analysis to consist principally of the tetrahydrate, C4H4O6Ca·4H2O. It is suspended in 800 cc. of water and treated with the calculated quantity (0.4 g. for every 1.0 g.) of concentrated (95–96 per cent) sulfuric acid. The mixture is warmed on the steam bath, with occasional shaking, or mechanical stirring, for thirty to forty hours, filtered hot, and the calcium sulfate washed well with hot distilled water.
C. 2,2-Difluorosuccinic acid. In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel, 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide is dissolved in 2 l. of water and 158 g. (1 mole) of potassium permanganate is then added. The mixture is cooled to 15–20° with an ice-salt bath, and 107 g. (0.75 mole) of 1-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutene is added through the dropping funnel during 1 hour while the permanganate solution is stirred and maintained at 15–20°. After the solution has been stirred for 2 hours more at this temperature, the manganese dioxide is removed by filtration and rinsed with three 300-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to a volume of 500 ml. by evaporation on a steam bath. The solution is then cooled and 85 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly with stirring. The cold solution is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. Drying of the ether extract is accomplished by agitating it for 5 minutes with 30 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. When the drying agent has been removed by filtration and rinsed with ether, the filtrate and the ether washings are combined and concentrated to give 91–97 g. (79–84%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid. The acid is recrystallized by dissolving it in hot nitromethane (1.25 ml. per g.), filtering the solution through a layer of filter aid if necessary, and cooling the solution to 3°. The crystals are collected by suction filtration and rinsed with 30 ml. of cold nitromethane. After drying, this gives 85–92 g. (74–80%) of 2,2-difluorosuccinic acid, m.p. 144–146°.
A 5-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 112.2 g. (1.002 mole) of freshly distilled 2,4,4-trimethyl-1-pentene and 1 l. of dichloromethane. The flask is immersed in an ice–salt bath, and the stirred solution is cooled to 0–5°. A solution of 158 g. (1.02 moles) of freshly distilled chromyl chloride in 200 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise with stirring from the dropping funnel while the temperature is maintained at 0–5°. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes, and 184 g. of 90–95% technical grade zinc dust is added. The mixture is stirred for 5 minutes, 1 l. of ice water and 400 g. of ice are added as rapidly as possible, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 minutes. The ice–salt bath is replaced with a heating mantle, and the flask is fitted for steam distillation. After distillation of the dichloromethane the residue is steam distilled. The distillate is transferred to a separatory funnel, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with three 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are distilled through a 56-cm., vacuum-jacketed, Vigreux column, removing the solvent. The product is transferred to a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask and distilled. After removal of a small amount of dichloromethane the fraction boiling at 45–52° (15 mm.) is collected, giving 90–100 g. (70–78%) of 2,4,4-trimethylpentanal.
The crude diaminotoluene is dissolved in eight times its weight of benzene (212 g.) at 70°, and the solution is filtered quickly through a hot Büchner funnel with moderate suction. The filtrate is cooled to 25°, and the mother liquor is decanted from the brown crystals. The mother liquor is concentrated to a volume of 25 cc. by distillation under atmospheric pressure and then cooled to 25°. The mother liquor is decanted from the diaminotoluene, and the entire product is dried in the air. The yield is 22.5 g. (81 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the diaminotoluene sulfate used; 74 per cent based on the dinitrotoluene used) of a product which melts at 98°.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel is placed 100 g. (0.58 mole) of p-bromotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 136). The stem of the dropping funnel and the thermometer should reach nearly to the bottom of the flask. The upper end of the condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap. The flask is heated with stirring in an oil bath until the temperature of the liquid reaches 105°. The liquid is illuminated with an unfrosted 150-watt tungsten lamp, and 197 g. (61.8 cc., 1.23 moles) of bromine is added slowly from the separatory funnel. About one-half of the bromine is added during the first hour, during which time the temperature is kept at 105–110°. The rest is added during about two hours while the temperature is raised to 135°. When all the bromine has been added the temperature is raised slowly to 150°.
The pentamethylbenzene obtained in this way is nearly pure, and one recrystallization from 95 per cent alcohol or from a mixture of equal volumes of alcohol and benzene gives a snow-white product, but the product generally melts over too wide a range for practical purposes. However, if fraction VII is refractionated under diminished pressure and the fraction boiling at 123–133°/22 mm. (practically all at 127–129°) is collected and recrystallized as in the following paragraph, a product melting quite sharply at 52° (true m.p. 53°) is obtained.
C. 3,6-Bis[(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl]-9-tetradecylcarbazole (3). A 500-mL single-necked round-bottomed, side-arm flask equipped with a glass stopper and a magnetic stirring bar is connected to a nitrogen-vacuum manifold. After evacuating and backfilling with nitrogen three times, the flask, in which a positive flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the procedure, is sequentially charged with iodinated carbazole 2 (23.7 g, 0.038 mol), CuI (0.147 g, 0.77 mmol), Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 (1.35 g, 1.9 mmol), THF (90 mL), and piperidine (55 mL). The flask is cooled in an ambient temperature water bath before 1-trimethylsilylacetylene (45.7 mL, 0.38 mol) is added in two portions over 5 min. The reaction mixture is then stirred for 23 h at room temperature. The solution changes from green to yellow with the formation of a white precipitate, and then the suspension changes to green and then black. The reaction mixture is then filtered through a coarse fritted funnel into a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15–20 mmHg, water bath temperature 40–45 °C). The crude product is purified by column chromatography [silica gel, 80 × 250 mm, hexanes 1 L, then hexanes/EtOAc 50/1 (2 L), then hexanes/EtOAc, 20/1 (1 L)] to afford diyne-substituted carbazole 3 as a yellow oil (19.9 g, 93%).
After standing for 2 hours, the solution of diazoketone is cooled in ice and treated with dry gaseous hydrogen chloride until the passage of the gas no longer causes evolution of nitrogen. At the end of this time, the original yellow color of the solution has changed to an orange-red. About 100 ml. of water is slowly and cautiously added to the ether solution in order to cause a separation into two layers. An additional 50 ml. of water is then added to give a more complete separation. The ether layer is then washed with two 50-ml. portions of a 5% solution of sodium carbonate in water. The ether solution is dried with anhydrous calcium chloride or calcium sulfate, the solvent evaporated, and the product distilled. The yield of benzyl chloromethyl ketone, b.p. 133–135°/19 mm. or 96–98°/1 mm., is 7.0–7.1 g. (83–85%) and.
A. (R)-(−)-Methyl 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diylphosphate. A 200-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a gas bubbler is charged with 20.0 g (57.4 mmol) of (R)-(−)-1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate, 40 mL of N,N-dimethylacetamide, and 10.0 mL (105.7 mmol) of dimethyl sulfate. The resulting pale-yellow oil is then treated cautiously in small portions with 10.4 g (123.8 mmol) of sodium bicarbonate. The addition causes gas evolution and foaming. Foaming subsides after ca. 20 min, and the resulting turbid yellow solution is stirred overnight at room temperature.
A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with an internal thermometer, a sealed stirrer, and a reflux condenser, the upper end of which is protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. In this flask are placed 307 g. (2 moles) of dry, pulverized betaine hydrochloride and 285 g. (174 ml., 2.4 moles) of thionyl chloride. The mixture is stirred and heated slowly. When the internal temperature reaches 68° copious evolution of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride occurs, and the mass becomes pasty. The temperature is maintained with stirring at 68–70° for 1.5 hours.
A. Sodium hypochlorite solution. A solution of sodium hypochlorite2 is prepared immediately before it is to be used. A mixture of 50 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 200 ml. of water is swirled until the solid dissolves. The solution is cooled to 0°, and 100 g. of crushed ice is added. The flask is then placed in an ice bath, and chlorine gas from a tank is bubbled through the solution until 41 g. (0.58 mole) is absorbed. An excess of chlorine should be avoided. The solution of sodium hypochlorite is kept in the dark at 0° until needed.
In a 500-ml. distilling flask are placed 107 g. (0.40 mole) of γ-bromopropylphthalimide and 240 ml. of xylene. Solution is effected by heating, and 24 ml. of xylene is distilled to remove traces of moisture. After cooling, the solution is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask with a ground-glass joint and treated with 107 g. (140 ml., 0.83 mole) of di-n-butylamine. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser and heated with occasional shaking for 10 hours in an oil bath maintained at 140–150°.
When extraction is complete the ether solution of 2-furylcarbinol is distilled until the temperature of the liquid (not the vapor) reaches 95°. Then the residue is distilled under diminished pressure. Some ether and water come over first, and the temperature then rises rapidly to the boiling point of 2-furylcarbinol. The yield of 2-furylcarbinol boiling at 75–77°/15 mm. is 310–325 g. (61–63 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Distillation of the resulting crude oil using a simple fractionating column gives 32–33 g. (94–97%) of pure 5,5-dimethyl-2-n-pentyltetrahydrofuran as a colorless liquid boiling at 31–33°/1.5 mm.; nD25 1.4257.
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer and dropping funnel, are placed 390 g. (3 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 235) and 900 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The solution is cooled in an efficient freezing mixture to 5°, and a cold solution of 107 g. (1.47 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is added dropwise with vigorous stirring at such a rate that the temperature remains between 5° and 7°. With efficient cooling about one-half hour is required to add the nitrite. The mixture is stirred for one-half hour longer and then allowed to stand for four hours, during which time it warms up to room temperature.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is placed an intimate mixture of 210 g. of dicyanodiamide (2.5 moles) and 440 g. of ammonium nitrate (5.5 moles) and. The flask is introduced into an oil bath at 110–120°, and the temperature of the oil is raised during about one-half hour to 160°. The bath is then held at this temperature and for three hours. During the first hour the mass melts to a clear liquid which begins to deposit crystals and finally sets to a solid cake. At the end of three hours the flask is removed from the bath; the product is allowed to cool and is extracted on the steam bath with successive quantities of water (about 2 l. is necessary to bring all soluble material into solution). The solution is filtered to remove white amorphous insoluble material (ammeline and ammelide).
The two-phase mixture containing N-methylhydroxylamine is added dropwise to the refluxing toluene solution of the aldehyde over 3 hours. During this time the distillate is collected and discarded in 25-ml. portions until the last such portion collected and discarded is clear. Reflux and stirring are continued for an additional 3 hours, and then the clear reaction mixture is allowed to cool. The product is extracted with three 80-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid. The extracts are combined, and the pH of the solution is adjusted to >12 by the slow addition of 30% aqueous potassium hydroxide. The basic mixture is extracted with two 120-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined extracts are washed once with 100 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The pentane is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled through a short Vigreux column under reduced pressure, yielding 19.1–19.6 g. (64–67%) of hexahydro-1,3,3,6-tetramethyl-2,1-benzisoxazoline, b.p. 90–92° (9 mm.).
A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 1-decene (4.2 g, 30 mmol). The flask is charged with a mixture of palladium chloride (0.53 g, 3 mmol), cuprous chloride (2.97 g, 30 mmol), and aqueous dimethylformamide (DMF/H2O = 7:1, 24 mL). With the other outlets securely stoppered and wired down, an oxygen-filled balloon is placed over one neck, and the flask is stirred at room temperature to allow oxygen uptake. After 1 hr, 1-decene (4.2 g, 30 mmol) is added over 10 min using the dropping funnel, and the solution is stirred vigorously at room temperature under an oxygen balloon. The color of the solution turns from green to black within 15 min and returns gradually to green. After 24 hr, the mixture is poured into cold 3 N hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and extracted with five 50-mL portions of ether. The extracts are combined and washed successively with 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, 50 mL of brine, and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed by evaporation and the residue is distilled using a 15-cm Vigreux column to give 2-decanone as a colorless oil (3.0–3.4 g, 65–73%, bp 43–50°C/1 mm and.
A. 2-Mercapto-4-amino-5-carbethoxypyrimidine. A 5-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask mounted in a heating mantle is fitted with a 250-ml. dropping funnel, an efficient, sealed, mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser connected to a calcium chloride drying tube. Absolute ethanol (625 ml.) is placed in the flask, the stirrer is started, and 23 g. (1 g. atom) of freshly cut sodium is added in portions. After the sodium has dissolved, 76.1 g. (1 mole) of thiourea is added to the warm, stirred solution in one portion. When the bulk of the thiourea has dissolved, 169 g. (1 mole) of liquefied ethyl ethoxymethylenecyanoacetate is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred mixture over a period of 2 hours. This rate of addition keeps the reaction mixture warm. The solution is then stirred and gently refluxed for 6 hours. The sodium salt of the carbethoxypyrimidine may precipitate during the course of the reaction.
B. tert-Butyl phenyl ketone. With a syringe a solution of 2.81 g. (0.0200 mole) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride in 15 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise, with stirring, to the cold solution (−60° to −65°) of the cuprate reagent. The resulting yellow-brown solution is stirred for 20 minutes (at −60° to −65°) and quenched by the addition, with a syringe, of 5 ml. of anhydrous methanol. The red-orange reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then poured into 100 ml. of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride. The copious precipitate of copper(I) thiophenoxide is separated by suction filtration and washed thoroughly with several 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is washed with two 50-ml. portions of aqueous 1 N sodium hydroxide and with one 50-ml. portion of aqueous 2% sodium thiosulfate. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted in turn with a fresh 50-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by distillation through a short Vigreux column. The residual pale yellow liquid is distilled through a short column under reduced pressure, yielding 2.73–2.82 g. (84–87%) of tert-butyl phenyl ketone as a colorless liquid b.p. 105–106° (15 mm.), 114–115° (44 mm.), n20D 1.5092, n25D 1.5066.
The deep-orange reaction mixture is diluted with an equal volume of water, poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel, and acidified with 3 M hydrochloric acid. The addition of 400 ml. of diethyl ether assists in effecting the separation of the clear, yellow, aqueous, lower layer from the fluffy-white ethereal suspension that forms the upper layer. This suspension is filtered through a 250-ml. coarse sintered glass funnel, and the precipitate of oximino ketone is washed with ether several times. After drying overnight in a vacuum desiccator at −5°, 48.0–48.5 g. (79% and) of a white product, m.p. 245–247° (dec.), is obtained; its 1H NMR spectrum (pyridine) shows it to be a 1:1 solvate of the oximino ketone with tert-butyl alcohol. This product is used without further purification in the synthesis of the α-diazo ketone.
A. 1-(2-Methylallyl)-2-(trimethylsiloxy)methylenecyclododecanol. A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask connected to a nitrogen bubbler and equipped with a mechanical stirrer with ground glass shaft and bearing a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a septum inlet is charged with 45.4 g (1.89 mol) of magnesium turnings and flushed for 5 min with nitrogen. Anhydrous ether, 450 mL, is added and the flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. Methallyl chloride, 64.6 mL (0.65 mol,) is added dropwise from the addition funnel to the stirred magnesium turnings during 45 min. (Caution! The reaction is exothermic and care must be exercised to add the methallyl chloride at a moderate rate with adequate stirring and cooling of the reaction mixture). During this time the reaction mixture turns to a gray heterogeneous slurry. Stirring is continued at 0°C for 1.5 hr and at 22°C for 1.5 hr.
The 300-mL, round-bottomed reaction flask is charged with 4.74 g (0.06 mol) of pyridine, 10.3 g (0.06 mol) of sodium triflate, and 80 mL of dry acetonitrile. The system is purged with nitrogen, and the reaction mixture is chilled and maintained at −40°C. The flow of dilute fluorine is started, and the flow rates from the nitrogen and fluorine cylinders are adjusted to introduce a 10% fluorine/90% nitrogen mixture at a rate of 90 mL/min just above the surface of the rapidly stirred solution. When a total of 2.7 L of fluorine (0.12 mol) is introduced, the flow of fluorine is discontinued and nitrogen only is flowed through the system at a rate of 45 mL/min for 30 min while keeping the reaction mixture at −40°C. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite to remove the sodium fluoride. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness with a rotary evaporator without heating. The crystalline residue is washed with 30 mL of dry ethyl acetate to give 11.0–12.0 g (74–81%) of crude product, mp 178–181°C. The crude material is dissolved in 18 mL of dry acetonitrile at room temperature, and 36 mL of dry diethyl ether is added. The precipitated crystals are collected by filtration under nitrogen to give 10.0–10.3 g (68–70%) of pure N-fluoropyridinium triflate, mp 182°C,(Note 10),(Note 11).
In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask provided with a mechanical stirrer are placed 75 g. (1 mole) of glycine (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 298) and 300 cc. of water. The mixture is stirred vigorously until the glycine is almost completely dissolved, when 215 g. (2 moles) of 95 per cent acetic anhydride is added in one portion. Vigorous stirring is continued for fifteen to twenty minutes, during which time the solution becomes hot and acetylglycine may begin to crystallize. The solution is placed in the refrigerator overnight to effect complete crystallization. The precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with ice-cold water, and dried at 100–110°. This product weighs 75–85 g. and melts at 207–208°. The combined filtrate and washings are evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a water bath at 50–60°. The residue on recrystallization from 75 cc. of boiling water yields a second fraction, of 20–30 g., which melts at 207–208° after being washed with ice-cold water and dried at 100–110°. An additional 4–6 g. of only slightly less pure product may be obtained from the mother liquor by concentration. The total yield is 104–108 g. (89–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The product is collected at 140–143°/5 mm., 132–135°/2.5 mm.; nD25 1.5176. The yield is 45–48 g. (78–83%).
Powdered potassium hydroxide (29.4 g., 0.43 mole) is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. Guaiacol (75 g., 0.60 mole) is added, and the mixture is allowed to react exothermically. After the reaction is complete, the mixture is stirred with a glass rod and then heated under reduced pressure for 3 hours at 150° in an oil bath.
C. 3-Imino-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)Pyrazolidine. To a 3-l. four-necked flask fitted with a condenser, a thermometer, a wide-mouthed funnel, and a high-speed mechanical stirrer having five pairs of blades are added 183 g. (1.00 mole) of 3-amino-3-pyrazoline sulfate and 1 l. of water. Sodium bicarbonate (210 g., 2.5 moles) is gradually added during 10 minutes with stirring. The rate of stirring is increased to 5000–6000 r.p.m., and a solution of 229 g. (1.20 moles) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in 400 ml. of benzene containing 0.5 g. of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate is added at one time. Three further portions of sodium bicarbonate are added sequentially: 25.2 g. (0.30 mole) after 15 minutes; 16.8 g. (0.20 mole) after 30 minutes; 16.8 g. (0.20 mole) after 55 minutes. The mixture is stirred for 5 hours at 18–25°, occasional cooling being required. Sodium bicarbonate (8.4 g., 0.10 mole) is added, then 200 ml. of ether, and stirring is continued for another hour. The colorless product is collected by filtration on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with three 50-ml. portions of ether followed by 50 ml. of water and dried at 90°. The yield is 139–180 g. (58–75%); m.p. 183–185°. The product is used directly in the next step.
The residue, consisting of sodium bromide, sodium cyanide, and trimethylene cyanide, is extracted with 300–400 cc. of ethyl acetate, which dissolves the trimethylene cyanide and does not dissolve the inorganic salts. This solution is filtered and the salt washed once with about 100 cc. of ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate is distilled at ordinary pressure and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of trimethylene cyanide boiling at 144–147°/13 mm. or 131–134°/10 mm. is 180–200 g. (77–86 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The apparatus consists of a 12-l. round-bottomed flask and a 250-cc. suction flask provided with stoppers and glass tubes as shown in Fig. 19. After the flasks have been charged, A is surrounded by an ice bath and B by a water bath heated to 40–50°. In flask A are placed 100 g. (1.1 moles) of aniline, 1 l. of water, and 100 cc. (1.2 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid; when the aniline has dissolved, sufficient water is added to bring the volume of the solution to 5 l. Flask B is charged with 577 g. (185 cc., 3.6 moles) of bromine; the baths are adjusted, and a rapid stream of air saturated with bromine vapor is drawn into A by applying suction at C and.
The diisovalerylmethane is regenerated by shaking the copper salt vigorously with 500 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid and 200 ml. of ether until all the salt has dissolved. The aqueous acid layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of diisovalerylmethane is 32–42 g. (58–76%, based on methyl isobutyl ketone), b.p. 115–116°/20 mm., nD25 1.4565 and.
To a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a 25- to 30-cm. column packed with glass helices to which is attached a water separator2 filled with hexane are added 126 g. (1.00 mole) of cyclooctanone, 100 g. (1.4 moles) of pyrrolidine, 100 ml. of xylene, and 0.5 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid. The solution is heated under reflux until the separation of water ceases. The water separator is replaced by a distillation head, and the reaction mixture is distilled through the column under reduced pressure to remove solvent and unreacted starting materials. When the head temperature reaches 50° (1 mm.), distillation is stopped, and the residue of almost pure N-(1-cycloocten-1-yl)pyrrolidine (152–161 g.) is used in the next step without further purification.
A mixture of 105.7 g. (0.55 mole) of ethyl benzoylacetate and 46.6 g. (0.5 mole) of aniline is placed in the dropping funnel D (Fig.4) at the top of the continuous reactor and after the column has been heated to 135° (transformer set at 80 volts) and. The reactants are then admitted to the column during about 15 minutes (this corresponds to a rate of amide formation of 396–400 g. per hour). Alcohol distils noticeably from the column during the addition and collects in flask G. At the completion of the reaction, 100 ml. of xylene is passed through the hot column to rinse out the residual amide. An additional 200 ml. of xylene is added to the receiver C, and solution is effected by warming. After the solution has been cooled enough to induce crystallization, 100 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 35–60°) is added with manual stirring. The mixture is chilled to 15°, then the crystalline product is separated by suction filtration and washed 300–400 ml. of petroleum ether. The yield is 99–100 g. (83–84%), m.p. 106–106.5°. The melting point of this product is not altered by recrystallization from benzene,(Note 9),(Note 10).
A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a nitrogen inlet, and a Y-tube fitted with a low temperature thermometer and a nitrogen outlet. The outlet is vented through a bubbler tube, maintaining a slight positive pressure. The flask and dropping funnel are flamed in a stream of dry nitrogen. To the flask is added 115.0 g. (0.4989 mole) of 3,5-dinitrobenzoyl chloride followed by 500 ml. of dry diglyme. The solution is stirred vigorously, and the flask is immersed in a cooling bath at −78°. A diglyme solution of lithium aluminum tri-tert-butoxyhydride is prepared in the following manner. Dry diglyme (450 ml.) is added with vigorous stirring to an Erlenmeyer flask containing 140.0 g. (0.5512 mole) of lithium aluminum tri-tert-butoxyhydride. After standing overnight, the resulting suspension is filtered under a blanket of dry nitrogen through a thick layer of Celite packed tightly on a Büchner funnel. The flask containing the filtrate is kept stoppered until the reducing agent is transferred to the dropping funnel. Dropwise addition of this solution is started when the contents of the reaction flask reach −72°. There is a color change and a temperature rise of a few degrees. The rate of addition is adjusted, maintaining the temperature of the mixture between −78° and −68°. After addition is complete the mixture is stirred at −78° for 30 minutes longer.
Sodium (69 g., 3 g. atoms) is introduced into flask A, which had been flushed previously with nitrogen. Ethanol (1.2 kg.) is added at such a rate that a continuous reflux is maintained. After the sodium is completely dissolved, the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. During this period the benzyltrimethylammonium chloride is prepared.
A slurry comprised of 33.6 g. (0.0998 mole) of commercial phenylmercury(II) acetate, 200 ml. of acetonitrile, and 14.4 g. (16.8 ml., 0.200 mole) of methallyl alcohol is prepared in a 500-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a thermometer. The slurry is stirred and cooled in an ice bath, and 22.4 g. (0.0998 mole) of powdered palladium(II) acetate is added over 1 minute. Stirring is continued with cooling for 1 hour, then at room temperature for 3 more hours. The temperature of the reaction mixture reaches a maximum of 27° after removal of the ice bath.
The contents of the flask are now allowed to cool to a temperature between 100° and 125°, and 500 g. (9.2 moles) more of the technical 85 per cent formic acid is added. The distillation is then repeated in exactly the same manner as described above and 500 cc. of distillate is collected between the temperatures from 195–260°. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool again and a third portion of 500 g. of formic acid is added. This distillation yields not more than 350 cc. of the desired fraction, indicating that the glycerol is used up and that further addition of formic acid is unnecessary; moreover, the residue left behind is now small, amounting only to 100–200 cc. The three distillations require from one to one and one-half days.
For recrystallization each crop of the crude acid chloride is dissolved in a minimum volume of boiling anhydrous benzene (about 100 ml. is required for the first crop) and petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°; about 50 ml. is required for the first crop) is added to the hot solution. Crystallization begins on cooling. After the mixture has cooled to room temperature, it is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and the acid chloride is collected on a filter and washed with a small portion of cold benzene. The yield of recrystallized acid chloride from the first crop of crude acid chloride is 27.6–33.4 g. (50–61%) of pale yellow prisms, m.p. 101–112°. The product obtained from crystallization of the second crop of acid chloride amounts to 3.3–3.6 g. (6–7%), m.p. 104–108°.
C. (+)-(1R,2S,9S)-11-Methyl-7,11-Diazatricyclo[7.3.1.02,7]Tridecane. A flame-dried, 250-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper, and a vacuum take-off adapter that can be attached either to the argon line or to the H2 supply is charged with cytisine methyl carbamate (6.50 g, 26.2 mmol), MeOH (100 mL) and platinum(IV) oxide (600 mg, 2.7 mmol). The resulting magnetically-stirred suspension is carefully evacuated and backfilled with argon (three times) before evacuating and backfilling with hydrogen (via hydrogen balloons attached to the two-tap adaptor). The cloudy black mixture is stirred vigorously under a hydrogen atmosphere for 5-12 h. The solids are removed by filtration through Celite and the filter cake is washed with CH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1) (50 mL). The filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure followed by removal of the last traces of solvent by high vacuum drying (10−3 mbar) to afford 5.93 g (90 %) of crude hydrogenation product as an off-white solid.
A. 2,2'-Dibromo-1,1'-binaphthyl. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 240 g (0.915 mol) of triphenylphosphine and 500 mL of dry acetonitrile. Stirring is begun and the solid is dissolved by warming the flask with hot water. The solution is then cooled with an ice–water mixture, and to this is added dropwise with stirring 155 g (50 mL, 0.969 mol) of bromine over a 1-hr period. The ice–water bath is removed and 120 g (0.420 mol) of 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl is added to the solution. The viscous slurry is stirred at 60°C for 30 min. The flask is now fitted for a simple distillation, and most of the solvent is removed by applying partial vacuum. The last trace of acetonitrile is removed at aspirator vacuum using a bath temperature of 100°C. The temperature of the resulting mass is raised carefully by means of a heating mantle to 240–260°C over a period of 1 hr, at which temperature an exothermic reaction occurs, with evolution of hydrogen bromide. After the exothermic reaction subsides, the reaction mixture is further stirred at 260–270°C for 1 hr, and then the temperature is gradually raised and kept at 310–320°C for 30 min to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture, a homogenous melt, is allowed to cool to ca. 200°C with stirring and to this is added 1000 mL of Celite with stirring. After the mixture is cooled below 70°C, it is extracted with 500 mL of a boiling 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and hexane. The solid material, separated by filtration through a sintered-glass funnel, is extracted further with three 200-mL portions of a boiling 1 : 1 mixture of benzene and hexane. The combined extracts are evaporated to give an orange-yellow viscous oil, which is dissolved in 200 mL of ethanol. The solution is left in a refrigerator for 2 days. 2,2'-Dibromo-1,1'-binaphthyl precipitates and is collected on a sintered-glass funnel to give 90 g of the crude product. Recrystallization from ethanol affords the pure dibromide (78.0 g, 45% yield) as pale-yellow, fine crystals.
In a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a sealed stirrer, dropping funnel, and air condenser, the open end of which is connected to a gas-absorption trap, are placed 188 g. (2 moles) of phenol and 268 g. (2 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate in 300 ml. of dry nitrobenzene and. The mixture is heated to 100° by means of an oil bath, stirring is started, and 532 g. (4 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride dissolved in 2.1 l. of dry nitrobenzene is added over a period of 30–45 minutes. The dropping funnel is then replaced by a thermometer, and the temperature of the solution is raised to 130° and held there 3 hours. By this time the evolution of hydrogen chloride will have practically ceased.
The 2-chlorolepidine is extracted, using two 750-ml. portions of ether. The extract is shaken with two 200-ml. portions of water and then dried over 50 g. of potassium carbonate. After removal of the ether, the residual oil is distilled from a 200-ml. modified Claisen flask. The colorless distillate boils at 132–135°/3 mm. and weighs 118–122 g. (89–92%). The distillate is melted if necessary and poured into 250 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–50°); the solution is then chilled in a freezing mixture; the crystals are filtered by suction and dried in a vacuum desiccator over paraffin. The snow-white 2-chlorolepidine melts at 58–59° and weighs 114–118 g. (86–89%).
To a solution of 38.2 g. (0.25 mole) of chloroacetal (b.p. 62–64°/20 mm.) in 800 ml. of absolute methanol, cooled in a hydrogenation bomb of about 1.1-l. capacity to the temperature of a Dry Ice-acetone bath, is added approximately 300 g. (290 ml.; about 18 moles) of liquid ammonia. The bomb is closed, connected with a pressure gauge, and heated at 140° with shaking for 10 hours.
To a solution of 4.0 g. (0.012 mole) of iridium tetrachloride in 4.5 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added 180 ml. of water followed by 52 g. (50 ml., 0.42 mole) of trimethyl phosphite. This solution then is added to a solution of 30.8 g. (0.200 mole) of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone in 635 ml. of 2-propanol contained in a 2-l. flask equipped with a reflux condenser. The solution is heated at reflux for 48 hours, at which time the 2-propanol is removed with a rotary evaporator. The remaining solution is diluted with 250 ml. of water and extracted with four 150-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, which are combined with the aqueous residue, dried over magnesium sulfate or potassium carbonate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 29–31 g. (93–99%) of cis-4-tert-butylcyclohexanol as a white solid. Analysis of the crude product by GC shows it contains 95.8–96.2% cis-alcohol and 4.2–3.8% of the trans isomer with essentially no ketone remaining. Recrystallization from 40% aqueous ethanol affords greater than 99% pure cis-alcohol, m.p. 82–83.5° after sublimation.
A. cis- and trans-5-Methyl-2-[1-methyl-1-(phenylmethylthio)ethyl]cyclohexanone (7-benzylthiomenthone). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Friedrich condenser connected by its upper joint to a mineral oil bubbler through which passes nitrogen gas is charged with 500 mL of tetrahydrofuran, 202.0 g (1.33 mol) of (+)-pulegone, and 181.0 g (1.46 mol) of benzyl mercaptan. The flask is flushed with nitrogen, 10 mL of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide is added, the flask is stoppered, and the mixture is heated to reflux under a static pressure of nitrogen. After 2 hr at reflux the pale-yellow solution is allowed to cool, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and washed with two 500-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The combined sodium chloride layers, in turn, are extracted with three 250-mL portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 2 hr, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation at aspirator vacuum. The residual liquid is distilled in a good vacuum to give a fraction of bp 167–174°C (0.4 mm) weighing 325–330 g (89–90%). The product is a mixture of cis and trans isomers otherwise highly pure as evidenced by spectral analysis.
A 2-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 300 ml. of water. Stirring is begun and 300 g. (7.50 moles) of sodium hydroxide are added in portions in order to maintain efficient stirring. A mixture of 141.5 g. (203.3 ml., 1.938 moles) of tert-butylamine, 117.5 g. (78.86 ml., 0.9833 mole) of chloroform, and 2 g. (0.009 mole) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride in 300 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the stirred, warm (ca. 45°) solution over a 30-minute period. The reaction mixture begins to reflux immediately and subsides within 2 hours; stirring is continued for an additional hour. After the reaction mixture is diluted with 800 ml. of ice and water, the organic layer is separated and retained, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane solutions are combined and washed successively with 100 ml. of water and 100 ml. of aqueous 5% sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
The heavy organic layer is separated from the distillate and washed with 10-ml. portions of concentrated sulfuric acid until the acid becomes only slightly colored during the washings; four washings usually suffice. The oil is then washed with one 100-ml. portion of water, two 50-ml. portions of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and finally with one 100-ml. portion of water. The product is dried over about 3 g. of calcium chloride and distilled from a 250-ml. distilling flask. The yield of pure, colorless o-chlorobromobenzene, boiling at 199–201°/742 mm., is 170–183 g. (89–95%) and.
Twenty-four grams (0.11 mole) of red mercuric oxide and 60 ml. of freshly distilled 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane are placed in a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a stirrer. A solution of 32.2 g. (0.20 mole) of bromine and 17.2 g. (0.20 mole) of cyclopropanecarboxylic acid in 50 ml. of tetrachloroethane is added dropwise to the stirred suspension of mercuric oxide over a period of 45 minutes, the flask being kept in a water bath at 30–35°. The mixture is stirred after the addition of the reactants until the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases.
Six hundred grams of crude pentamethylbenzene is heated to 100° and poured slowly with stirring into 1 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol heated to 70° in a 2-l. beaker, and allowed to stand overnight at a temperature of approximately 30°. The crystals formed are collected on a suction filter and dried at room temperature overnight on a porous plate. The yield is about 250 g..
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, is placed 5 l. of a 5 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide (6.25 moles). To this is added the crude ethyl n-butylacetoacetate (about 925 g.) obtained (p. 248) from 5 moles of ethyl acetoacetate. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for four hours, during which time the monosubstituted acetoacetic ester is completely saponified and passes into solution. The mixture is then allowed to stand until the unsaponified material separates completely as an oily layer. The aqueous layer is separated and transferred to a flask provided with a stopper fitted with a separatory funnel and a large bent glass tube leading to a condenser set for distillation.
C. tert-Butylamine hydrochloride. In a 2-l. flask fitted with an efficient bulb-type reflux condenser are placed 203 g. (1 mole) of tert-butylphthalimide, 1 l. of 95% ethanol, and 59 g. (1 mole) of 85% hydrazine hydrate. The solution is refluxed for 2 hours and cooled, and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml.) is added until the solution is strongly acid to Congo red paper, though a large excess of acid is avoided. The voluminous precipitate of phthalhydrazide is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel with the aid of suction and washed with four 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 200 ml. About 1 l. of water is added, any insoluble material is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is concentrated to about 300–350 ml. If any additional insoluble material separates it is removed by filtration, and the solvent is completely removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. This crude amine hydrochloride may be converted to the free amine as described below, or it may be purified by solution in 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution being filtered and 500 ml. of dry ether being added to the filtrate. The crude amine hydrochloride is collected on a filter; the solvent is removed by suction, and the residue is dissolved in hot absolute ethanol using 5 ml. per gram of material; absolute ether (50% of the volume of ethanol) is added, and the solution is cooled in a refrigerator for several hours. All the tert-butylamine hydrochloride is collected on a Büchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator. It weighs 79–97 g. (72–88%) and melts with sublimation at 270–290°.
A. (R,R)-1,2-Diammoniumcyclohexane mono-(+)-tartrate. A 1-L beaker assembled with a mechanical overhead stirrer and a thermometer is charged with 250 mL of distilled or deionized water. L-(+)-Tartaric acid (75 g, 0.5 mol) is added with stirring in one portion. The solution is stirred as 114 g (120 mL, 1 mol) of racemic trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane is added carefully in one portion. A slurry is formed initially but complete dissolution is observed once addition is complete. Glacial acetic acid (50 mL) is then added in one portion. Product begins to precipitate during the addition, and continues to precipitate while the reaction mixture is allowed to cool from 90°C to 5°C, with stirring, over 3 to 4 hr. The temperature is maintained at 5°C for an additional hour and the product is isolated by filtration. The filter cake is washed with 50 mL of cold (5°C) water followed by 4 × 50-mL portions of ambient temperature methanol. The enantiomeric excess of the derivatized diamine is determined by sampling the top and bottom of the filter cake using the procedure below. The product is dried at 40-45°C under reduced pressure to give 105-110 g (80-83%) of the (R,R)-1,2-diammoniumcyclohexane mono-(+)-tartrate salt as a white powder. (R,R)-1,2-Diaminocyclohexane obtained from this salt exhibits >98.0% enantiomeric excess.
In a 1-l. beaker are placed 100 g. (0.47 mole) of benzoin (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 94), and 50 g. (57 cc.) of pyridine. The mixture is heated until a solution is obtained, then cooled in an ice bath until solid. The mass is coarsely ground, and 75 g. (46 cc.; 0.63 mole) of thionyl chloride is added slowly with vigorous stirring and cooling in a water bath. After each addition of thionyl chloride, the reaction mixture becomes quite hot, and considerable amounts of sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are evolved. At first the mass becomes pasty and then soon sets to a light yellow solid. After about an hour, water is added and the solid is coarsely ground and filtered. It is finely triturated twice with water, filtered by suction, and pressed as dry as possible. The white powder is dried to constant weight over sulfuric acid or calcium chloride. The yield of crude product is about 125 g. The compound is dissolved in 450 cc. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol, filtered, and the filtrate cooled by running water. There is obtained 77 g. of colorless crystals which, after drying in the air, melt at 66–67°. On cooling the mother liquor in an ice-salt mixture, there is obtained an additional 9 g. of crystals melting at 65–66°. Further cooling of the filtrate yields no more product. The total yield is 80–86 g. (74–79 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
B. (2R,4R)-1,5-Dichloro-2,4-pentanediol . Catalyst preparation: A 100-mL Schlenk flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar, rubber septum, and an argon vacuum line. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum and cooled under oxygen-free dry argon (twice), and it is then charged with 1,5-cyclooctadieneruthenium(II) chloride (RuCl2, COD) (79.2 mg, 0.283 mmol) and [(S)-BINAP, 212 mg, 0.340 mmol]. The flask and its contents are purged by evacuation and flushed with argon (twice). Triethylamine (Et3N, 470 μL, 3.37 mmol) is added via syringe followed by toluene (20 mL) via cannula. The solution is heated at reflux for 16 hr under argon, then allowed to cool to room temperature. The resulting orange solution is concentrated by stirring while the flask is held at a vacuum of ca. 1 mm and the toluene and excess triethylamine are condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap to give crude [RuCl2-(S)-BINAP)]2-Et3N catalyst as an orange solid.
A. (R)-(−)-1-Amino-1-phenyl-2-methoxyethane (2) .2 A solution of (R)-(−)-2-phenylglycinol (1) (25.0 g, 182.2 mmol) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (370 mL) is added dropwise via an oven-dried, 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel to an oven-dried, 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing a stirred suspension of potassium hydride (7.82 g, 195 mmol) in anhydrous THF (150 mL) at 25°C under an argon atmosphere. The resultant pale yellow mixture is stirred overnight and then treated dropwise with a solution of methyl iodide (25.2 g, 177.6 mmol) in THF (220 mL) over 2 hr at room temperature. The resultant mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hr, poured into cold (~5°C) saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution (1.5 L) and extracted with anhydrous diethyl ether (4 × 250 mL); the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Filtration and rotary evaporation gives 39.2 g of yellow oil that is purified by vacuum distillation (bp 47-50°C, 0.2 mm) to yield 25.3 g (94%) of 2 as a colorless oil.
The oil is dissolved in 500 mL of diethyl ether under a nitrogen atmosphere, cooled to −78°C in a dry ice–acetone bath and 18 g (0.11 mol) of tetrafluoroboric acid–diethyl ether complex is added dropwise by syringe over a 30-min period, while the bath temperature is maintained at −78°C. The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature, and the powdery yellow solid is isolated by filtration through a 250-mL, coarse-frit, Schlenk filter tube. The product is washed several times with fresh ether and dried under a stream of nitrogen and then under reduced pressure (oil pump). The yield of salt 3 is 31–39.1 g (60–75%). The product may be used without further purification and may be stored under nitrogen of 0°C for several weeks with no observable decomposition.
To a dry, 1-L Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is added under argon zirconocene dichloride (100 g, 0.342 mol), followed by dry tetrahydrofuran (650 mL). Dissolution of the solid is accomplished by gentle heating with a heat gun. To the solution at ~35°C is added dropwise, over a 45-min period, a filtered solution,(Note 5) of lithium aluminum hydride (3.6 g, 94 mmol) in ethyl ether (100 mL),(Note 7). The resulting suspension is stirred at room temperature for 90 min. The mixture is then Schlenk-filtered under argon using a "D" frit. The resulting white solid is washed with tetrahydrofuran (4 × 75 mL), methylene chloride (2 × 100 mL) with stirring or agitation of the stirbar immersed in the slurry, and then with ether (4 × 50 mL). The resulting white solid is dried under reduced pressure to give a white powder, 66 g, 75% yield.
B. 2,3,4,5,6-Penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid. Tetra-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid monohydrate (50 g., 0.13 mole) is slowly added to a chilled (0–5°) solution of 18 g. of fused zinc chloride in 190 ml. of acetic anhydride contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. The solution is kept in an ice bath for an hour and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 hours. After dilution with 1 l. of water, the solution is extracted with four 100-ml. portions of chloroform. In order to remove the chloroform, 200 ml. is distilled, 250 ml of toluene is added, and 250 ml. of this solution is distilled. Another 250 ml. of toluene is then added and the volume is reduced to 300 ml. The product crystallizes on standing at 0°. The solid is removed by filtration, washed with toluene and then with petroleum ether (b.p. 35–55°). A yield of 44–45 g. (83–84%) of anhydrous 2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid, melting at 110–111°, is obtained; [α]D23 +11.5° (c = 4.0 in ethanol-free chloroform).
The crude material is purified by recrystallization. To a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, stopper, and 100 mL addition funnel are added a 3-cm oval stir bar, 30 mL of anhydrous EtOH, in which 0.3 g of NaOH has been dissolved, and the crude product (5.97 g). The mixture is stirred with warming to 35 °C in order to dissolve the product, then 70 mL of deionized water is added dropwise from the addition funnel over 15 min. The product begins to crystallize after 10 mL water is added. On completion of the water addition, the mixture is stirred for 5 min at room temperature, then filtered using a Büchner funnel and filter paper. The flask is washed with 2 × 15 mL of deionized water and the washes are then used to rinse the crystalline product on the Büchner funnel. The crystalline product is allowed to dry on the Büchner funnel for 30 min to 1 h to provide 4.84 g (68%) of product as a tan, free-flowing solid.
A carefully dried 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube is charged with 100 g. of cholesterol, 750 ml. of acetone, and 1 l. of benzene. A boiling tube is introduced to prevent bumping, and the mixture is heated to boiling in an oil bath which is maintained at 75–85° during the reaction. A solution of 80 g. of aluminum tert-butoxide (p. 48) in 500 ml. of dry benzene is added in one portion to the boiling solution. The mixture turns cloudy and in 10–15 minutes develops a yellow color. Gentle boiling is continued at a bath temperature of 75–85° for a total of 8 hours. The mixture is then cooled, treated with 200 ml. of water and then 500 ml. of 10% sulfuric acid, shaken vigorously, and transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel. The mixture is diluted with 1.5 l. of water and shaken for several minutes, after which the yellow aqueous layer is drawn off into a second separatory funnel and shaken out with a small amount of benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed thoroughly with water and dried by filtration through a layer of sodium sulfate; the solvent is evaporated, the last traces being removed by heating the residue at 60° at the water pump vacuum. The oily yellow residue solidifies when it is cooled in an ice-salt bath and scratched. For crystallization the material is dissolved in a mixture of 70 ml. of acetone and 100 ml. of methanol; the solution is allowed to cool very slowly and is seeded, for otherwise the product tends to separate as an oil. After the bulk of the material has crystallized, the mixture is allowed to stand for 1 day at 0°; the product is then collected, washed with 100 ml. of ice-cold methanol, and dried in vacuum at room temperature. The yield of almost colorless cholestenone, m.p. 77–79°, is 70–81 g. (70–81%). Recrystallization by the same method gives material melting at 78.5–80.5° with 90% recovery and.
In a 2-l., three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 250-cc. separatory funnel, are placed 148 g. (2 moles) of n-butyl alcohol and 210 g. (1.1 moles) of pure p-toluenesulfonyl chloride. From the separatory funnel 320 cc. (1.6 moles) of 5 N sodium hydroxide is run in at a rate that does not cause the temperature of the reaction mixture to exceed 15°; the addition requires three to four hours.
Upon cooling the mixture, the oily layer of amine solidifies to a red crystalline mass. The crude amine is filtered with suction, washed with two 60-cc. portions of ice-cold water, pressed thoroughly, and transferred to an ordinary 125-cc. Claisen flask. The filtrate is extracted with three 60-cc. portions of benzene, the extracts are transferred separately to the Claisen flask, and the benzene is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The residual amine is distilled under reduced pressure and is collected at 172–174°/24 mm.. The distillate solidifies quickly to a mass of colorless crystals which melt sharply at 87.5–88°. From 58 g. (0.32 mole) of veratric amide there is obtained 39–40 g. (80–82 per cent of the theoretical amount) of 4-aminoveratrole.
C. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxy-8-acetylcoumarin (III). In a clean, dry, 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 200 g. (0.92 mole) of dry, powdered 4-methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin and 453 g. (3.4 moles) of technical anhydrous aluminum chloride. The flask is stoppered and shaken vigorously for 3–5 minutes in order to mix the ingredients thoroughly. The stopper is removed and the flask attached to a reflux condenser fitted with a gas-absorption tube. The flask is placed in an oil bath the temperature of which is raised quickly to 125° and then slowly over a period of 2 hours to 170°. At the end of this time the flask is removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool, and immersed in an ice bath. About 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and then 2.4 l. of dilute (1:7) hydrochloric acid is added over a period of about 2 hours. The mixture is then heated on a steam bath for 30 minutes with vigorous stirring in order to effect complete decomposition. The mixture is filtered and the precipitate washed with four 50-ml. portions of cold water and sucked dry. This crude product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 4 l. of hot 95% ethanol, filtering the hot solution through a warm funnel, and chilling the filtrate. The crystals are collected on a funnel and air-dried. The product melts at 162–163°, and the yield is 145–155 g. (72.5–77.0%).
B. Ethyl 3-amino-4-((3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)amino)benzoate (4). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a 24/40 ground-glass joint is equipped with a large egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (40 mm x 18 mm). The flask is charged with nitro compound 3 (7.00 g, 18.7 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and methanol (285 mL). The flask is then fitted with a 3-way gas inlet adapter with an argon-filled balloon attached to one of the arms. While stirring the resultant yellow suspension, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times. While stirring under a blanket atmosphere of argon, the adapter on the flask is briefly removed and Pearlman's catalyst (500 mg,) is added as a suspension in methanol (10 mL + 5 mL rinse). The argon balloon is then replaced with another balloon filled with hydrogen gas and, while stirring the mixture, the flask is evacuated and back-filled with hydrogen gas three times. The dark yellow-black suspension is allowed to stir under the hydrogen atmosphere for a period of 24 h, after which TLC analysis indicate the disappearance of compound 3. The hydrogen balloon is once again replaced with an argon-filled balloon and the flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon gas three times. The 3-way stopper is then removed, Celite 545(r) (10g) is added and the suspension stirred under the argon blanket for 10 min. The solid is removed by suction filtration over filter paper using a ceramic Büchner funnel and the solids are washed with two portions of methanol (20 - 30 mL each). The clear, dark brown filtrate and washings are collected and combined and the volatiles removed under reduced pressure (30 °C, 5 - 10 mmHg, then at room temperature, 0.1 mmHg) to give 6.0-6.3 g (93-98% yield) of compound 4 as a dark gray-black solid which is suitable for use in the next step without further purification.
A. (−)-(1R,3R)-3-Chlorocamphoric anhydride. (+)-(1R,3S)-Camphoric acid, (125 g, 0.625 mol) is added in small portions to a 1000-mL, three-necked flask charged with 455 g of phosphorus pentachloride (2.19 mol) and equipped with a ground glass adaptor connected to a T-tube with one outlet open to the atmosphere and the remaining outlet connected to a gas trap. The mildly exothermic reaction is controlled by gently swirling the flask in an ice bath as required. After the addition is complete, the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser topped by a calcium chloride (CaCl2) drying tube, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux (using an oil bath at 125°C) for 12 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the volatile material is removed by distillation using a bath temperature of 50°C under aspirator vacuum with the distillate boiling at 30–35°C. The residual liquid is then added to a mechanically-stirred mixture of ice (2 kg) and dimethylformamide (DMF, 125 ml), and stirring is continued until all the ice has melted. The resulting waxy white precipitate is collected by vacuum filtration while cold (2°C), washed with three, 500-mL portions of cold water, and dried under vacuum. The crude white solid, (−)-(1R,3R)-3-chlorocamphoric anhydride (122 g, 90%), is of sufficient purity to be used in the next step and.
Fifty-six grams (0.25 mole) of benzil monohydrazone [Org. Syntheses, 15, 62 (1935)] is mixed in a mortar with 81 g. (0.38 mole) of yellow mercuric oxide and 35 g. of anhydrous calcium sulfate. The mixture is introduced into a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a condenser, and a thermometer. The flask is placed in a water bath, 200 ml. of dry thiophene-free benzene is added, and the suspension is stirred at 25–35° (thermometer in solution) for 4 hours and. The reaction mixture is filtered through a fine-grained filter paper, with slight suction, and the residue is washed with dry benzene until the washings are colorless.
A 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient condenser, the upper end of which is protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. In this flask 23 g. (1 g. atom) of lustrous sodium is dissolved in 400 ml. of absolute ethanol. The sodium is cut into about 25 pieces, and the entire amount is added at one time. It may be necessary to cool the flask in a cold-water bath if the reaction becomes violent. When all the sodium has dissolved, the solution is cooled to 50° and 130 g. (127 ml., 1 mole) of ethyl acetoacetate is added dropwise while the temperature is maintained between 45° and 50°. The resulting solution is cooled to about 35°, and 92.5 g. (78.4 ml., 1 mole) of epichlorohydrin is added dropwise with stirring over a period of 20 minutes. The temperature is then raised to 45° and is kept at 45–50° for 18 hours. The clear red-orange solution is cooled to 15°, and chilled glacial acetic acid (60–65 ml.) is added with stirring until the solution is just acid to litmus; a mush of sodium acetate crystals precipitates. The dropping funnel is replaced by a capillary tube, and the condenser is set for distillation. About three-fourths of the ethanol is removed under reduced pressure while air is bubbled into the mixture through the capillary tube. Care is taken that the internal temperature does not exceed 100°.
The methanol extracts and mother liquor from the final recrystallization of the anti isomer are combined and evaporated to dryness (rotavap). The residue is dissolved in 50 mL of boiling ethyl acetate in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, to which is then added 150 mL of boiling hexanes. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and to stand at that temperature for 2-3 hr. Filtration yields the first crop of syn isomer (approximately 3.6 g). Second and third crops of product are obtained by evaporating the mother liquor to dryness and crystallizing the residue from the same solvent mixture (1:3 ethyl acetate/hexanes), to give a total of 5.3 g (25%) of syn isomer, mp 192-194°C,.
(B) Ethyl Ethoxyacetate.—The ethoxyacetic acid, which should amount to about 125 g. (1.2 moles), is placed in a 750-cc. Erlenmeyer flask containing 230 cc. (3.9 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol. The flask is set in a pan filled with cold water, and dry hydrogen chloride is passed into the mixture. After the mixture becomes saturated it is allowed to stand twenty-four hours to ensure the completion of the reaction at room temperature. The solution is cooled, and a saturated solution of sodium carbonate is added cautiously and with stirring to avoid excessive foaming. The addition is continued until the mixture is faintly alkaline to litmus; an excess of sodium carbonate lowers the yield and should be avoided. The ester is extracted with four 100-cc. portions of ether; the extract is dried with 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and the ether is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled at ordinary pressure. The yield of ester boiling at 153–155° is 110–115 g. (55–58 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the chloroacetic acid, or 69–72 per cent based on the ethoxyacetic acid).
B. (+)-[(7,7-Dimethoxycamphoryl)sulfonyl]imine. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and nitrogen inlet, is charged with 22.8 g (0.1 mol) of the crude (−)-(3-oxocamphorylsulfonyl)imine prepared above, 125 mL of trimethyl orthoformate, 68 mL of methanol, and 5 mL of concd sulfuric acid. The mixture is heated to 85–90°C in an oil bath and. After heating for 4 hr, during which time precipitation of the product is observed, the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and an additional 30 mL of trimethyl orthoformate and 10 mL of methanol are added. Heating is continued for an additional hour, after which the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and transferred with the aid of 250 mL of methylene chloride to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The solution is washed successively with water (100 mL), aqueous 20% sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), water (4 × 100 mL), and brine (100 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure affords 22.8–23.0 g (83–85%) of the crude (+)-(7,7-dimethoxy camphorylsulfonyl)imine as a light pink solid, mp 179–184°C ((Note 9) and). This product is suitable for further reaction without purification.
B. Phenyl heptyl ketone. To the solution prepared in Section A. is added 18 ml. (1.0 mole) of water. The nitrogen flow is ceased, and the drying tube is quickly replaced with a stopcock attached with Tygon tubing, to a gas-measuring tube. A solution of 14.6 g. (0.100 mole) of diazoacetophenone in 125 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred solution over a period of one hour. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred vigorously for one hour at room temperature, then heated to reflux for one hour. The resulting mixture is cooled to approximately 25° with an ice bath,(Note 7), and. A solution of 73 ml. (0.2 mole) of 3 N sodium acetate solution is added, followed by the dropwise addition of 23 ml. (0.22 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide, maintaining the reaction temperature below ca. 20° (ice-cooling). The cooling bath is then removed, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour.
A solution of 430 g. (5 moles) of vinyl acetate in 1.5 l. (26 moles) of absolute ethanol is placed in flask A. The solution is cooled to about −10° by an ice-salt mixture, and stirring is started. Gentle suction is applied at the outlet tube of B, and the bromine is introduced into A by a rapid current of air. The rate of introduction of the bromine, controlled by adjustment of the clamp E, should be regulated so that 8–10 hours is required to volatilize all the bromine. Stirring is stopped, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight and to come to the temperature of the room. The mixture is poured into 1.7 l. of ice water; the lower layer of bromoacetal and ethyl acetate is separated, washed twice with 300-ml. portions of cold water and once with 300 ml. of cold 10% sodium carbonate solution, and dried over two successive 25-g. portions of anhydrous calcium chloride for 30 minutes. The crude product weighs 990–1010 g.; it is purified by distillation under diminished pressure (water pump) through a 6-in. Widmer column or a 20-cm. Vigreux column. The first fraction consists of ethyl acetate; this is followed by the pure bromoacetal which boils at 62–63°/15 mm. (84–85°/30 mm.) and which amounts to 610–625 g. (62–64%).
A. 4-Acetylpyridine oxime. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride (25.0 g, 0.36 mol) is dissolved in 50 mL of water, and the solution is added to 70 mL of 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask. To this magnetically stirred solution is added at one time 4-acetylpyridine (36.3 g, 0.30 mol); a precipitate forms rapidly. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0–5°C for 2 hr; then the precipitate is collected by suction filtration and washed with 500 mL of cold water.
The operator should wear goggles and long-sleeved gloves during the next two operations. The dried, pulverized barium salt is introduced in 200-g. portions into a melt of 600 g. each of sodium and potassium hydroxides contained in a 14 by 20 cm. copper beaker. The mixture is stirred with a copper stirrer and the temperature determined with a thermometer in a copper well.. Each portion is well stirred in before the next is added. The temperature is then slowly raised to 250–260°, at which point a vigorous reaction occurs with copious evolution of gas. After this has slackened (about 30 minutes) the temperature is raised to 280–310° and maintained there for 1 hour, then allowed to drop to 200°. The melt is ladled into 6 l. of water and. The barium sulfite is filtered by suction, and the filtrate is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 2.5 l. is required).
A. 4-Chlorophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate . A 250-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a Teflon-coated thermocouple, nitrogen bubbler, and septum is charged with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, 4-chlorophenol (13.2 g, 102.5 mmol), and methylene chloride (125 mL) at room temperature. Pyridine (9.1 mL, 112.5 mmol) is added to the solution via syringe, and the reaction mixture is cooled to −10°C with an ice/methanol cooling bath. Triflic anhydride (18.7 mL, 111.3 mmol) is added dropwise to the reaction mixture via syringe at a rate such that the temperature remains below −2°C. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at −10°C, then allowed to warm to room temperature. When the reaction is complete, water (75 mL) is added to the mixture and the resulting two-phase mixture is stirred for 15 min. In a 500-mL separatory funnel, the layers are separated and the organic (lower) layer is washed sequentially with 0.2 N hydrochloric acid (HCl), water, and brine (75 mL each). The final organic layer is concentrated to a yellow oil via rotary evaporation. The yellow oil is diluted with 25 mL of 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes and filtered through a bed of silica gel (63 g charged to a 150-mL filter funnel and prewetted with 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes, Note 5). The silica gel is washed with 5% ethyl acetate in hexanes until the desired triflate is no longer detected in the filtrate (250 mL). The filtrate is concentrated via rotary evaporation to give the desired triflate as a clear, colorless liquid (25.7 g, 96% yield)(Note 6).
If a pure grade of glutaric acid is desired, it is decolorized by boiling for about 1 hour with 10 g. of charcoal in water solution. The charcoal is removed by filtration, the water is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the dry residue is recrystallized from chloroform. The yield of white glutaric acid, m.p. 98–99°, is 94–99 g. (71–75%).
The reaction mixture is cooled in ice, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding dropwise with stirring 185 ml. of a 25% solution of ammonium chloride in water. The ether solution becomes clear, and the salts separate as a cake. The ether solution is decanted, combined with 150 ml. of ether that has been used to rinse the salt cake, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether the product is distilled under reduced pressure to give 154.5–164.5 g. (82.5–88%) of m-chlorophenylmethylcarbinol boiling at 99–104°/4 mm.; nD25 1.5405.
A. Diphenyl diselenide. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser mounted with a combined inlet-outlet assembly connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler. The apparatus is flamed dry while a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the system. In the cooled flask a solution of phenylmagnesium bromide is prepared from 160 g. (1.02 mole) of bromobenzene, 24.0 g. (0.988 g.-atom) of magnesium, and 550 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The dropping funnel is removed, and an Erlenmeyer flask containing 70 g. (0.89 g.-atom) of selenium is attached to the neck of the flask with a section of nylon tubing. The selenium is added in portions at a rate sufficient to maintain a vigorous reflux. The addition requires 15–30 minutes, after which the mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for another 30 minutes. The Erlenmeyer flask and nylon tubing are removed, and 3 g. (0.2 mole) of water is added to hydrolyze any excess Grignard reagent. The mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 74.3 g. (23.8 ml., 0.465 mole) of bromine is added dropwise at a rate such that the ether does not reflux. Cooling and stirring are continued as a solution of 53.5 g. (1.00 mole) of ammonium chloride in 140 ml. of water is added slowly. The mixture is filtered by gravity into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask, and the granular precipitate is washed thoroughly with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined filtrates are evaporated, the remaining solid is dissolved insofar as possible in 500 ml. of hot hexane, and a small amount of insoluble material is separated by gravity filtration. The filtrate is allowed to crystallize at room temperature and then at 6°. The yellow microcrystalline solid is collected, washed with 30 ml. of pentane, and dried in the air, 89–97 g. (64–70%) of diphenyl diselenide, m.p. 60–62° and.
B. 1,1,1-Triacetoxy-1,1-dihydro-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one (2) . A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring and fitted with an immersion thermometer, is charged with 88.2 g of the moist solid iodinane oxide 1 , 150 mL of glacial acetic acid , and 300 mL of acetic anhydride. The flask is flushed with dry argon, and maintained under a dry argon atmosphere. Magnetic stirring is commenced, and the mixture is heated to 85°C (internal temperature) over 30 min by means of an oil bath, and kept at this temperature until all the solids dissolve (~20 min) to afford a colorless to clear yellow solution. Heating and stirring are discontinued and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature in the oil bath for 24 hr. A large quantity of colorless crystals separate during this time. The resulting crystalline solids are isolated by careful vacuum filtration in the reaction vessel under argon using a fritted adapter followed by washing the solids with three 80-mL portions of anhydrous ether and subsequent vacuum filtration in the reaction vessel as above,. Residual solvent is removed under vacuum affording 101.0 g (74% yield over 2 steps) of periodinane 2 as a white, free-flowing crystalline solid that is largely or completely soluble (slightly cloudy to clear solution) in chloroform and methylene chloride and is sufficiently pure (~95%) to be suitable for use in oxidations,(Note 17),(Note 18),(Note 19).
E. 4-Acetyl-7,8-dimethyl-2-oxa-4-azabicyclo[4.3.0]non-7-en-3-one. A solution of 63.5 g (0.5 mol) of 3-acetyl-2(3H)-oxazolone, 27.5 g (0.33 mol) of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, and 2.0 g of hydroquinone in 125 mL of benzene is heated at 160°C under nitrogen in a 360-ml Hastelloy C shaker tube. After 12 hr, the pressure vessel is cooled to room temperature, recharged with 27.5 g of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, and heated another 12 hr at 160°C. The vessel is again cooled, recharged with 27.5 g of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene, and heated at 160°C for a final 12 hr. The resulting mixture is distilled to give 36.4–40.3 g (35–39%) of crude product, bp 115–130°C (0.5 mm), which solidifies and. This material can be recrystallized by adding 36.4 g of melted product to 50 mL of boiling hexane, followed by cooling to give 27.6 g (26%) of crystals, mp 72–78°C.
After the inlet tube is removed from the reaction flask, 400 cc. of absolute alcohol and 161 g. (1 mole) of dry α-phenylacetoacetonitrile (m.p. 88.5–89.5°) (p. 487) are added. The neck is temporarily closed by a cork, and the nitrile is dissolved by warming with stirring. The flask is then surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the solution vigorously stirred, so that any nitrile which crystallizes will be finely divided. When the temperature reaches −10°, the inlet tube is inserted and a stream of dry hydrogen chloride passed through, with moderate stirring, at such a rate that the bubbles rising from the 6-mm. tubing in the sulfuric acid wash bottle can just be counted. This is continued for five to eight hours until the mixture is saturated. The ice bath is then removed, stirring continued until all the solid has dissolved (about one hour), and the flask allowed to stand overnight.
B. 2-Naphthalenethiol. A 250-ml. flask, fitted with a diffusion tube3 and swept with nitrogen, is charged with 23.1 g. (0.100 mole) of O-2-naphthyl dimethylthiocarbamate. The flask is heated at 270–275° for 45 minutes in a salt bath. After cooling, a solution of 8.4 g. (0.15 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 10 ml. of water and 75 ml. of ethylene glycol is added to the flask. The diffusion tube is replaced with a condenser, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 1 hour. The cooled reaction mixture is poured onto 150 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, the mixture is shaken two times with 150-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform layers are discarded, and the aqueous layer is cautiously acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and shaken three times with 75-ml. portions of chloroform. The organic layers are combined and dried by filtration through anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation, yielding 13–15 g. of crude product. Distillation yields 10.3–12.8 g. (71–80%) of pure 2-naphthalenethiol, b.p. 92–94° (0.4 mm.), m.p. 80–81°.
The discoloration of purified methyl iodide is greatly retarded by the addition of a drop of mercury, and traces of iodine in an old sample may be removed by shaking with mercury. A very highly colored product is best washed with very dilute sodium thiosulfate, then with water, before drying.
B. (1RS,2SR,5R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)cyclohexanol (3/4). In a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask fitted with a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing funnel, and a mechanical Hershberg stirrer2 are placed 16.0 g (0.70 mol) of sodium and 220 mL of toluene. The solution is heated to reflux and maintained at this temperature. By vigorous stirring a fine suspension of sodium is obtained. To this stirred suspension a solution of 54.5 g (0.24 mol) of equilibrated 2 in 40.8 g (0.68 mol) of 2-propanol is added dropwise at such a rate that controlled refluxing is maintained. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed for an additional 8 hr and then cooled to 0°C. The mixture is diluted with 250 mL of ether and carefully poured into 260 mL of ice water. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted 3 times with 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation. Fractional distillation of the concentrate gives 39.0–48.9 g (70–88%) of pale-yellow 3/4, bp 103–107°C/0.01 mm (126°C oil-bath temperature).
B. Norcarane. In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser protected by a drying tube filled with Drierite are placed 46.8 g. (0.72 g. atom) of zinc-copper couple and 250 ml. of anhydrous ether. A crystal of iodine is added, and the mixture is stirred until the brown color has disappeared. A mixture of 53.3 g. (0.65 mole) of cyclohexene and 190 g. (0.71 mole) of methylene iodide is added in one portion. The reaction mixture is then heated under gentle reflux with stirring. After 30–45 minutes, a mildly exothermic reaction occurs which may require cessation of external heating. After the exothermic reaction has subsided (approximately 30 minutes), the mixture is stirred under reflux for 15 hours. At the end of this time, most of the gray couple has been converted to finely divided copper. The ether solution is decanted from the copper and unreacted couple, which are then washed with two 30-ml. portions of ether. The washes are combined with the bulk of the solution and shaken with two 100-ml. portions of saturated ammonium chloride solution, 100 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 ml. of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. The ether is distilled through a 20 × 2-cm. column packed with glass helices. The residue is distilled through a 45-cm. spinning-band column2 to give 35–36 g. (56–58%) of norcarane, b.p. 116–117°, nD25 1.4546.
The ligroin solution of the chloramine is separated from the aqueous layer in a chilled, short-stemmed 1-l. separatory funnel and washed successively with 50 ml. of ice-cold 3 N sodium hydroxide, 50 ml. of ice water, and 50 ml. of cold 2 N sulfuric acid. The ligroin solution becomes nearly colorless. The chloramine is extracted from the solution with sulfuric acid in the following manner. An ice-cold mixture of 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) and 80 ml. of water is allowed to stand in contact with the ligroin solution for 10 minutes without shaking, then for 20 minutes with occasional shaking; the mixture is kept cool by immersion in an ice bath. After separation from the acid layer, the ligroin is extracted with two 60-ml. portions of cold concentrated sulfuric acid. The combined sulfuric acid extracts are used for ring closure. The ligroin, which contains not more than a trace of chloramine, is discarded.
After about 12 hours, the ammonium salt of the imide which has precipitated is removed by filtration, washed on a Büchner funnel with about 200 ml. of ether and air-dried. It is dissolved in the minimum amount (about 800 ml.) of boiling water, and the solution is made acid to Congo red paper with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The free imide precipitates immediately and forms a white slurry which is cooled in an ice bath. The imide is collected on a Büchner funnel and dried at 100° in an oven, or in a vacuum desiccator. The yield is 266–287 g. (65–70%), m.p. 187–191°.
One of the condensers is then replaced by a dropping funnel, and enough 50% sulfuric acid (about 200 ml.) is added, with stirring and cooling, to make the solution acid to Congo red paper. When the solution has cooled, it is extracted with eight 400-ml. portions of ether. The ether extract is carefully distilled on a steam bath until the ether and chloroform are removed.
After most of the mineral oil has been removed, 400 ml. of benzene is added to the sodium hydride, followed by 71 g. (0.6 mole) of diethyl carbonate. This mixture is heated to reflux, and a solution of 38 g. (0.3 mole) of cyclooctanone in 100 ml. of benzene is added dropwise from the dropping funnel over a period of 3–4 hours. After the addition is complete, this mixture is allowed to reflux until the evolution of hydrogen ceases (15–20 minutes).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, bearing a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, are placed 64 g. (2.37 gram atoms) of aluminum shavings, 200 g. (254 ml., 2.7 moles) of dry tert-butyl alcohol, and 5–10 g. of aluminum tert-butoxide. After the mixture is heated to boiling on a steam bath, approximately 0.4 g. of mercuric chloride is added followed by vigorous shaking. As the heating is continued the color of the reaction mixture gradually changes from clear to milky to black, and hydrogen is evolved. When the mixture has become black, the heating is interrupted.
A solution of 250 g. (1.5 moles) of u.s.p. chloral hydrate in 450 cc. of warm water (50–60°) is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask bearing a reflux condenser and thermometer. The condenser is temporarily removed and 152.5 g. (1.52 moles) of precipitated calcium carbonate added; this is followed by 2 cc. of amyl alcohol and a solution of 10 g. of technical sodium cyanide in 25 cc. of water. Although the reaction is exothermic, the reaction mixture is heated with a low flame so that it reaches 75° in about ten minutes; at this point heating is discontinued. The temperature continues to rise to 80–85° during five to ten minutes and then drops. As soon as the temperature begins to fall the solution is heated to boiling and refluxed for twenty minutes. The mixture is then cooled to 0–5° in an ice bath, acidified with 215 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), and extracted with five 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried with 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, the ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled in vacuum from a Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. The yield of dichloroacetic acid, b.p. 99–104°/23 mm., is 172–180 g. (88–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 5-l. crock or battery jar, provided with a powerful mechanical stirrer, are placed 3.5 l. of water and 249 g. (165 cc., 2.16 moles) of thiophosgene (p. 506). To the vigorously stirred mixture is added slowly 255 g. (2 moles) of p-chloroaniline during about one-half hour. The stirring is continued for about an additional one-half hour. The dark brown oil is separated, washed with 50 cc. of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid, and placed in a flask for steam distillation.
A 250-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 25-ml., graduated, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 7.60 g. (0.0500 mole) of phenoxyacetic acid, 5.40 g. (0.0500 mole) of 1,4-benzoquinone, 1 g. (0.006 mole) of silver nitrate, and 125 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred and heated to 60–65° with a heating mantle until dissolution is complete. The resulting solution is stirred vigorously while a solution of 13.7 g. (0.0601 mole) of ammonium peroxydisulfate in 25 ml. of water is added at a rate of 0.5 ml. per minute for the first 40 minutes, then at a rate of 0.25 ml. per minute for the last 20 minutes. Throughout the addition, the reaction mixture is maintained at 60–65° and.
C. Preparation of lithium hexamethyldisilazide(LiHMDS)/lithium ethoxide. As the addition of Part B above is progressing, an oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet, and septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and charged via syringe with 42.1 mL (32.2 g, 0.200 mol) of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisilazane, 5.9 mL (4.6 g, 0.100 mol) of absolute ethanol, and 160 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The rapidly stirred solution is cooled with an ice bath and 120 mL (0.300 mol) of 2.5 M butyllithium in hexanes is added via syringe over a 20-min period. The resulting solution of lithium hexamethyldisilazide and lithium ethoxide is stirred with continued cooling for a period of about 30 min and is then cooled with a dry ice-acetone bath.
B. ε-Caprolactam : The reaction apparatus (see Fig. 1, Note 9) is charged with 1-triisopropylsilyloxy-1-azidocyclohexane (25.9 g, 87.1 mmol) and cyclohexane (435 mL, Note 10). The clear, colorless solution is purged with nitrogen for a 15 min period to exclude oxygen. The solution is cooled to ca. 0°C and irradiated (≥200 nm) for 3.5 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to afford a pale yellow oil. The crude oil is dissolved in dichloromethane (ca. 10 mL) and applied to a 6 × 6-cm column of silica gel (88 g, 230-400 mesh packed with 1 : 1 ethyl acetate/hexanes). An additional 1 cm of silica gel is added to the top of the column and the mixture is stirred with a glass rod to homogenize the layer, rinsed with eluent, and the column is repacked. The column is eluted with 1 : 1 ethyl acetate/hexanes (200 mL, Note 12), then with 1 : 9 methanol/ethyl acetate (500 mL), and fractions are collected in 25-mL test tubes. The fractions containing the desired product are identified by thin layer chromatography, combined, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford ε-caprolactam (8.20 g, 83%, Note 14) as an off-white solid.
The solution is stirred and cooled to −75° with an acetone–dry ice bath, and 2.90 g. (0.0500 mole) of propionaldehyde is added through a dropping funnel. The solution is stirred at −75° for 5 minutes. The acetone–dry ice bath is replaced with a water bath, and the solution is stirred at 20° for 30 minutes. The solution is diluted with 250 ml. of ether and washed with two 100-ml. portions of 5 M aqueous ammonium chloride, two 100-ml. portions of water, and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted with the same 250-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at 40° (25 mm.). The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 10 × 0.7 cm., unpacked, vacuum-jacketed column, and the material boiling at 93–98° (2 mm.) furnishes 7.90–7.99 g. (82–83%) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-1-hexen-4-ol,.
In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a mercury-sealed stirrer, 250 g. (2 moles) of 1,3-dichloro-2-butene and 1.25 l. of 10% sodium carbonate are heated at reflux temperature for 3 hours. The 3-chloro-2-buten-1-ol is extracted with three 300-ml. portions of ether, which are then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Fenske column, and the residue is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask, yielding 134 g. (63%) of 3-chloro-2-buten-1-ol, b.p. 58–60°/8 mm., n20D 1.4670.
This residue is stirred at room temperature while 150 ml. of triethylamine is added. Triethylamine hydrobromide begins to precipitate soon after the addition is started, and the resulting slurry is refluxed gently for 15 minutes. It is then cooled to room temperature, and the insoluble material is removed by filtration and washed with benzene. Concentration of the combined filtrates under reduced pressure leaves an oily residue, which is dissolved in 600 ml. of diethyl ether. The ethereal solution is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, washed with two 20-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting oil is distilled at reduced pressure. A forerun of 265 mg. is collected below 103° (22 mm.) before 6.7 g. (70%) of 2H-pyran-2-one distils as a colorless oil, b.p. 103–111° (19–22 mm.).
This distillate is now treated with enough sodium hydroxide so that the mixture is left just faintly acid, and the furfural separated. It amounts to 180–220 g. The wet furfural is distilled under reduced pressure from a Claisen flask which is heated in an oil bath. The temperature of the bath is never permitted to rise above 130°. At first, water together with some furfural distils, and this fraction is separated to be worked up with a later portion. Finally, 165–200 g. of pure furfural (b.p. 90°/65 mm.; 159°/745 mm.) distils, and this fraction, collected separately, is found to be practically colorless. The distillation of the crude material must not be carried out under ordinary pressure; otherwise the product turns dark rapidly on standing. After one distillation under reduced pressure as described, however, a distillation under atmospheric pressure may be carried out without the objectionable results just mentioned.
This mixture is recrystallized three times with the same mixture of solvents and the product is collected after 1 hr at 0°C to give 8.7 g (47.9%, mp 101–103°C) of a 25 : 1 mixture of diastereoisomers (values based on the 8a-methyl signal integration on NMR spectra).
C. Methyl N-(2-methyl-2-butenyl)carbamate. A 250-mL, two-necked flask, equipped with a gas outlet stopcock and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and containing a magnetic stirring bar, is flushed with dry nitrogen and charged with a solution of N1,N2-bis(methoxycarbonyl)sulfur diimide from Part B in 30 mL of dry chloroform. The solution is cooled with ice water, and 14.1 g (0.20 mol) of 2-methyl-2-butene is slowly dropped in with stirring over 1 hr. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred for another 10 hr at room temperature. The funnel is replaced by a distillation unit and most of the solvent is removed (11–15 mm, bath temperature 30°C). To the residue are added 240 mL of a 10% solution of potassium hydroxide in methanol and about 10 mL of water. The mixture is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature, and any precipitate is filtered off. The residue is washed with 50 mL of methanol, and the filtrate, a red solution, is concentrated at 40°C (11–15 mm). The residue is taken up in 450 mL of ether and washed with four 100-mL portions of water. The ethereal layer is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate and treated with charcoal until the color has changed from red to yellow, whereupon the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resultant oil is distilled at 70–75°C (3 mm), 62–64°C (0.2 mm) to give the colorless product, yield 10.7–13.7 g (43–52%, based on N,N-dichlorocarbamate) and.
B. General oxidation procedure for alcohols. A sufficient quantity of a 5% solution of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide in anhydrous dichloromethane is prepared to provide a sixfold molar ratio of complex to alcohol, an excess usually required for complete oxidation to the aldehyde. The freshly prepared, pure complex dissolves completely in dichloromethane at 25° at 5% concentration, giving a deep red solution, but solutions usually contain small amounts of brown, insoluble material when prepared from crude complex. The alcohol, either pure or as a solution in anhydrous dichloromethane, is added to the red solution in one portion with stirring at room temperature or lower. The oxidation of unhindered primary (and secondary) alcohols proceeds to completion within 5 to 15 minutes at 25° with deposition of brownish-black, polymeric, reduced chromium–pyridine products. When deposition of reduced chromium compounds is complete (monitoring the reaction by GC or TLC is helpful), the supernatant liquid is decanted from the (usually tarry) precipitate, which is rinsed thoroughly with dichloromethane.
Stirring is continued while the added alkali is completely neutralized by adding concentrated (36N) sulfuric acid (1 ml.) dropwise from a medicine dropper over a period of about 3 minutes until an apparent pH of about 4 is reached. The solution is then stirred for an hour, during which time the pH should not change.
In a 500-cc. three-necked flask, provided with a mercury-sealed stirrer and a calcium chloride tube, 68 g. (0.1 mole) of α-cellobiose octaacetate, m.p. 220–222° (p. 124), is suspended in 300 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol. A solution, prepared by dissolving 0.25 g. (0.01 gram atom) of sodium in 50 cc. of methyl alcohol, is added, and the mixture is stirred vigorously for one hour at room temperature. The mixture becomes thin as the hydrolysis proceeds and the solvent acquires a slight color. After the time specified the crystalline solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with four 25-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The weight of the nearly colorless crude cellobiose corresponds closely to the theoretical amount (34 g.). For purification it is dissolved in 125 cc. of hot water containing a few drops of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is clarified with 1–2 g. of Norite and filtered by suction. The colorless filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to a small volume, continuing until a large portion of the cellobiose has crystallized, and the crystalline magma is washed into an Erlenmeyer flask with 100 cc. of methyl alcohol. The mixture is stirred well and allowed to stand for several hours for completion of the crystallization, and the sugar is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 25 cc. of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The yield of pure cellobiose, [α]20°D + 34.8° (in 6 per cent aqueous solution), is 31 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount). On concentrating the mother liquor to a small volume and adding alcohol as before, 1 g. of equally pure product is obtained, making the total yield 94 per cent of the theoretical amount.
To 211 g. (1 mole) of 3-nitrophthalic acid (p. 408) in a 300-cc. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser is added 205 g. (190 cc., 2 moles) of acetic anhydride (99–100 per cent). The mixture is heated to gentle boiling until the acid is completely dissolved and then for about ten minutes longer. The hot mixture is poured (Hood) into a 15-cm. porcelain dish and allowed to cool. The crystal mass is ground thoroughly in a mortar and filtered by suction. The crystals are returned to the mortar and the filtrate (about 140 cc.) is placed in a 300-cc. distilling flask. The crystals are ground with 150 cc. of alcohol-free ether and filtered. They are again returned to the mortar and similarly washed.
The reaction mixture is then decomposed by the careful addition of ice-cold dilute sulfuric acid prepared by adding 56 cc. of concentrated acid (sp. gr. 1.84) to 435 g. of ice. During this neutralization the temperature of the mixture is maintained at about 5–10° by means of an ice-salt bath. The solution, which should now be acid to Congo red paper, is diluted with cold water to a volume of about 4 l. The ethyl 2-ketocyclohexylglyoxalate separates as a heavy oil and is removed. The aqueous solution is extracted with four 500-cc. portions of benzene. The crude product is combined with the extracts, and the resulting solution is washed with two 200-cc. portions of water. The benzene solution is then allowed to stand in a separatory funnel for a few minutes until it is free from suspended water.
In the reaction flask is placed 600 ml. of commercial tert-butyl alcohol, and the air in the flask is displaced by dry nitrogen gas. Then 29 g. (0.75 gram atom) of metallic potassium is added, in portions, to the alcohol. The mixture is heated on a water bath until all the potassium has dissolved, and then 68 g. (0.5 mole) of o-formotoluide is added and brought into solution. The condenser is set for distillation with a filter flask as the receiver; this flask is protected from the air by connecting it to the trap used in the initial operation. The reaction flask is surrounded by a metal bath, and the excess alcohol is removed by distillation. The residue is heated to 350–360° for about 20 minutes and then is allowed to cool in a stream of nitrogen. The residue is decomposed by addition of 300 ml. of water, and the mixture is steam-distilled to remove the indole. The distillate is extracted successively with 300 ml. and 100 ml. of ether, and the combined ether extracts are shaken with cold dilute 5% hydrochloric acid to remove small amounts of o-toluidine. The ether extract is washed with 100 ml. of water, followed by 100 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution, and is dried over 20 g. of sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. Indole distils at 142–144°/27 mm. (128°/10 mm.; 121°/5 mm.) as a pale yellow oil which solidifies and then melts at 52–53°. The yield is 23 g. (79%).
To a suspension of 300 g. (1.35–1.43 moles) of anthracene of 80–85 per cent purity in 3 l. of carbon tetrachloride, in a 5-l. flask fitted with dropping funnel, stirrer, and reflux condenser, is added slowly 567 g. (182 cc., 3.55 moles) of bromine. The bromination takes place in the cold with separation of the sparingly soluble 9,10-dibromoanthracene; in order to prevent undissolved anthracene from becoming coated over, it is necessary to maintain vigorous stirring throughout the reaction. A tube from the top of the condenser conducts hydrogen bromide to cold water, in which it is absorbed. The addition of the bromine occupies about one-half hour; the rate is so adjusted that a minimum of bromine is carried over with the hydrogen bromide.
C. trans-1-Acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene. In a 1-L, two-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a nitrogen gas inlet, and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 8.73 g (50 mmol) of cis-1-acetoxy-4-chloro-2-cyclohexene and 400 mL of a 0.18 M solution (72 mmol) of sodium dimethyl malonate in acetonitrile. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and then heated in an oil bath at reflux for 21 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and 5 g of solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is added. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr, poured into 800 mL of ether, and the resulting mixture is filtered. The organic phase is collected and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford 16.1 g of the product together with dimethyl malonate. The excess dimethyl malonate is removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 70°C (0.2 mm). The residual crude yellow oil was dissolved in a minimal amount of ethyl acetate and passed through a short silica plug (30–35g, Alfa silica) gel (53 μm) eluting with a small amount of fresh ethyl acetate. Removal of ethyl acetate on a rotary evaporator and further concentration at 0.2 mm overnight yielded 11.6–12.2 g (86–90%) of trans-1-acetoxy-4-(dicarbomethoxymethyl)-2-cyclohexene as a clear oil, essentially pure (99% by GLC).
The product in M is treated with small amounts of solid sodium bicarbonate to neutralize any acid present. The cold liquid is filtered through a small filter into a 1500-cc. distilling flask containing about 1 g. of hydroquinone. It is then distilled into a tared dark bottle containing about 1 g. of hydroquinone. The yield of product boiling at 52.5–55.5° obtained from 1200 g. (13 moles) of dry glycerol is 240–350 g. (33–48 per cent of the theoretical amount).
D. 1,3,5-[Tris-piperazine]-triazine. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a magnetic stirrer, condenser, nitrogen inlet, and 250 mL addition funnel is charged with 1,3,5-[N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-piperazine]-triazine (27.9 g, 44.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and 286 mL of methanol. The solution is left to stir at 0 °C for 30 min. A solution of 153 mL (0.918 mol, 21 equiv) of 6N hydrochloric acid is then added over 70 min keeping the temperature at ~ 1 °C and the resulting light yellow slurry is left to stir at 0 °C for 2 h. The reaction slurry is then allowed to warm to ambient temperature over 3 h and then slowly heated to an internal temperature of 40 °C for 12 h (the slurry became homogeneous at 27 °C). Off-gassing was observed as the temperature increased. The volatile organic components are removed using a rotary evaporator 34-40 °C until only ca. 100 mL of water remains. The resulting aqueous solution is cooled to 0 °C and made alkaline (pH = 14) by addition of 237 mL (657 mmol, 15 equiv) of a 10% NaOH solution. The resulting alkaline solution is extracted with chloroform (3 × 250 mL), and the organic phases are combined and dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is filtered and evaporated at 34 °C to afford the product as a white solid (14.1 g, 96 %), mp 200-208 °C.
A 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with reflux condenser, stirrer, and dropping funnel and containing 20.4 g. (0.10 mole) of iodobenzene2 is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 35°. Seventy-five grams (65 ml., 0.50 mole) of commercial 40% peracetic acid is added with vigorous stirring over a 30-minute period. Solid may begin to form before all the peracetic acid has been added, but, although this may slow down the stirring, it does not decrease the yield or cause a rise in temperature.
In a 5-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 250-mL dropping funnel and a mechanical stirrer was placed a solution of 1.6 L of reagent-grade ammonium hydroxide solution and the flask was cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. The solution of the crude camphorsulfonyl chloride, prepared in the preceding section, was added dropwise to the ammonium hydroxide solution at 0–10°C over a period of 1 hr. The reaction mixture was warmed to room temperature, stirred for 4 hr, the organic layer separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 250 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine (250 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent on the rotary evaporator gave 104.0 g (90%) of the crude camphorsulfonamide and.
B. N-(2-Propenyl)-N-(2-propynyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (3). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar is charged with allyl tosylamide (31.7 g, 150 mmol), anhydrous potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (24.8 g, 1.2 equiv, 180 mmol), 1-bromo-2-propyne (20.0 mL, 1.2 equiv, 180 mmol), and acetone (300 mL). The flask is equipped with a water-cooled condenser fitted with a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with argon introduced through the septum and a positive pressure of argon is maintained with an argon-filled balloon. The reaction mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 24 hr. After complete consumption of starting material, monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC,), the reaction mixture is allowed to cool and is concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with EtOAc (250 mL) and water (125 mL) and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 200 mL of EtOAc and the combined organic phases are washed with brine (50 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is recrystallized from 2.5 mL of ether and 250 mL of 20% EtOAc/hexanes to afford ca. 30 g (80%) of 3 as nearly colorless crystals. A second crop totaling 5.9 g (16%, 96% in total) is also obtained.
The stirrer is removed, 125 ml. of technical acetic anhydride is added to the residue, and, after thorough mixing, the mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour. The condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube is left attached, and the other necks of the flask are closed. At the end of the heating period salt is removed from the cooled reaction mixture by filtering it with suction, using a filter aid mat, into a 250-ml. Claisen flask. The reaction vessel and filter are washed with a few milliliters of acetic acid.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer is placed a solution of 70 g. (1.75 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 400 cc. of water. To this solution is then added 230 g. (1.71 moles) of 2-chlorocyclohexanol (p. 158). The mixture is stirred vigorously for about one hour. The stirring is then stopped and the upper layer is separated and fractionated carefully through an efficient column.
B. (3S)-1-(Dimethylphenylsilyl)-1-buten-3-ol (3a) and (3R)-1-(dimethylphenylsilyl)-1-buten-3-ol acetate (3b) . A 400-mL pentane solution of 20.0 g (97.08 mmol) of the racemic secondary allylic alcohol 2a in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is prepared. A crude preparation of 10.0 g of lipase Amano AK is added along with 24.8 mL (269.1 mmol) of freshly distilled vinyl acetate. The heterogeneous mixture is stirred vigorously at 25°C for 4 hr before being filtered through a sintered glass funnel to recover the enzyme extract. The extract is washed with ether (Et2O) (2 × 20 mL). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the products are purified by column chromatography on silica gel: gradient elution 4% EtOAc/hexanes affords 11.56 g of acetate (R)-3b (46.59 mmol, 48%), and gradient elution 20->35% EtOAc/hexanes affords 9.3 g of alcohol (S)-3a (45.12 mmol, 46%), as faint yellow oils, and.
A. Diethyl aminomalonate. An ethereal solution (about 150 ml.) of diethyl isonitrosomalonate prepared from 50 g. of diethyl malonate is washed with 80-ml. portions of 1% sodium bicarbonate solution until the final washing has a distinct yellow color. The ethereal solution is dried over 40 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate in a refrigerator overnight and then filtered into a tared round-bottomed flask. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure at a temperature below 30° (water bath). The weight of the residue in one case was 59.6 g. Assuming complete conversion of the 0.312 mole of diethyl malonate to diethyl isonitrosomalonate, a 0.1-mole aliquot (19.1 g.) of the residue is placed in a 500-ml. reduction bottle provided for the Parr Hydrogenator. To this is added 100 ml. of absolute alcohol and 3 g. of 10% palladium-on-charcoal catalyst. The bottle is placed in a hydrogenator, and the system is flushed three or four times with hydrogen. With the initial reading on the pressure gauge at 50–60 lb., the bottle is shaken until no further drop in pressure is observed (about 15 minutes).
A. 1-Benzoyl-2-(1,3-dibenzoyl-4-imidazolin-2-yl)imidazole.2 A 12-L, wide-mouthed, round-bottomed vessel fitted with an efficient air-driven stirrer and thermometer is charged with 68 g (1.0 mol) of imidazole, 202 g (2 mol) of triethylamine, and 1000 mL of acetonitrile. To the mixture is added dropwise over a 1-hr period and with external cooling 281 g (2.0 mol) of benzoyl chloride, the temperature is maintained at 15–25°C. After addition is complete, stirring is continued for another hour at ambient temperature. With continued stirring 1 L of ether and 5 L of water are introduced, whereupon the temperature is brought to 5°C. The crystalline product is removed by filtration and is sucked dry with the aid of a rubber dam. Rinsing of the filtercake with, successively, water, acetone, and ether gives, on air-drying, 181–190 g (80–85%) of product, mp 197–198°C. This product (5 g), taken up in 50 mL of boiling 90% dimethylformamide diluted while hot with water to the cloud point, gives, on cooling, 4.5 g of analytically pure stout prisms, mp 202–203° C.
If further purification is desired, just prior to use the crude material (40 g.) may be distilled at approximately 3 mm from anhydrous calcium chloride, affording very pure benzyl chloromethyl ether (35 g.), b.p. 70–71° (3 mm.) and.
A mixture of 400 g. of polyphosphoric acid and 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid is heated to reflux in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer. Dibenzyl ketone (42.0 g., 0.200 mole) is then added, and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux (130–135°) for 1.5 hours. The solution is cooled to 30° in an ice water bath, and 1 l. of water is added slowly with stirring. The brown precipitate which forms is collected by filtration, washed with 1 l. of water, and dissolved in 1 l. of hot benzene. The hot benzene solution is treated with 2 g. of activated carbon, filtered hot through a pad of diatomaceous earth, dried with 10 g. of magnesium sulfate, decanted from the magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to 500 ml. On addition of 450 ml. of hexane and cooling to 5–10°, tan crystals of the crude pyranone separate. Filtration affords 25–27 g. (45–49%) of product melting at 202–206°. For purification this material is dissolved in 500 ml. of hot benzene, treated with 1 g. of activated carbon as before, and precipitated from solution by the addition of 250 ml. of hexane and cooling of the mixture to 5–10°. On filtration 19–21 g. (34–38%) of 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-diphenyl-4H-pyran-4-one is obtained. This material melts sharply at 207–209°. An additional quantity (3–4 g., 5–7%) of somewhat less pure product (m.p. 204–206°) may be recovered by evaporation of the filtrate and recrystallization of the residue from 200 ml. of benzene-hexane (50% benzene by volume).
With the stirrer in rapid motion phosgene is passed into the solution of anthranilic acid at such a rate that bubbles of gas escape slowly into the ammonia scrubber (about two bubbles per second). Isatoic anhydride appears as a precipitate soon after the stream of phosgene is started. The temperature rises but is prevented from exceeding 50° by regulation of the rate at which phosgene is introduced. The stream of phosgene is continued for 2–4 hours, or until the rate of absorption is clearly much decreased. The flask is disconnected, and residual phosgene is blown out by passing a current of air through the mixture. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel and is washed with three 500-ml. portions of cold water. The first crop amounts to 54–56 g.
A. (+)-Isomenthone. Into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel are placed 54.6 g (0.35 mol) of (+)-isomenthol and 350 mL of ether. A solution of chromic acid, prepared by mixing 56.7 g (0.23 mol) of potassium dichromate and 31.0 mL (0.58 mol) of 98% sulfuric acid and diluting to 200 mL with water, is added dropwise to maintain the reaction temperature at 25°C. The mixture is stirred for a further 2 hr. The ether layer is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 100-mL portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure to leave an oil. Distillation through a short Vigreux column gives the main fraction of (+)-isomenthone as a clear, colorless liquid (40.5 g), bp 64–64.5°C at 5 min; [α]D16 +114° [CHCl3, c 5.09].
A. N-Sulfinylaniline. A solution of 82.5 g. (0.69 mole) of pure thionyl chloride in 100 ml. of anhydrous benzene is added slowly to a solution of 46.5 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled aniline in 250 ml. of anhydrous benzene contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, with swirling and occasional cooling in an ice bath (if necessary). An immediate precipitation of aniline hydrochloride occurs. After the addition of the thionyl chloride solution is complete, the mixture is heated to reflux, protected from moisture, on a heating mantle until a clear solution is obtained (2–5 hours). The solvent and excess thionyl chloride are evaporated under reduced pressure at 50° and the residual brownish yellow liquid is distilled under vacuum to yield 63–65 g. (91–94%) of yellow N-sulfinylaniline, b.p. 88–95° (17–20 mm.), n21D 1.6253.
A. Hexafluoroacetone hydrazone. A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a gas-inlet tube, a Dewar condenser, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 16 g. (0.50 mole) of anhydrous hydrazine [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 10 (1988)] and cooled in an ice-methanol bath. The condenser is filled with a cooling mixture of ice and methanol, the magnetic stirrer is started, and 82.5 g. (0.500 mole) of hexafluoroacetone imine [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 664 (1988)] is slowly distilled into the flask through the gas-inlet tube, while the temperature is maintained below 10°. After the addition, which requires about 1 hour, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, then poured rapidly into a 500-ml., single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing 150 g. of phosphorus pentoxide. A spatula is used to partially mix the liquid with the phosphorus pentoxide; the flask is quickly fitted with a simple still head with condenser and heated with a heating mantle until no further distillation occurs. The crude distillate is redistilled through a 45-cm. spinning-band column, giving 48–53 g. (53–59% conversion) of hexafluoroacetone hydrazone as a colorless liquid, b.p. 95.5–96°, n25D 1.3298.
A. 10-Methyl-Δ1(9)-2-octalone N,N-dimethylhydrazone. A 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Dean-Stark trap is maintained under a dry nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 7.4 g. (0.045 mole) of 10-methyl-Δ1(9)-2-octalone, 9.0 g. (0.15 mole) of N,N-dimethylhydrazine, 150 ml. of dry benzene, and 0.02 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid. This mixture is refluxed for 10–14 hours, after which time no additional water separates. Benzene and excess N,N-dimethylhydrazine are removed by simple distillation, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure, giving 8.1 g. (87%) of the dimethylhydrazone as a pale-yellow liquid, b.p. 94–98° (0.2 mm.),.
The cooled reaction product is treated with 200 cc. of water, the layer of oil separated, washed once with a second portion of water, and subjected to distillation under reduced pressure. The first fraction of the distillate contains benzyl alcohol together with unchanged aldehyde, as well as a small quantity of water. The temperature then rises rapidly to the boiling point of benzyl benzoate, when the receiver is changed. The product boils at 184–185° /15 mm., and analysis by saponification shows it to consist of 99 per cent ester. The yield is 410–420 g. (90–93 per cent of the theoretical amount). This benzyl benzoate supercools readily, but after solidifying melts within one degree of the highest recorded value (19.4°) and therefore need not be refractionated, unless material of exceptional purity is required.
The ether solution is washed thoroughly six times with 25-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution and twice with 25-ml. portions of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The ether layer is allowed to dry over anhydrous sodium sulfate at room temperature for 24 hours. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residual oil is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure, using an oil bath. A yield of 47–54 g. (64–73%) of a pale yellow oil, boiling at 114–117°/1 mm., is obtained. On cooling, the oil crystallizes; m.p. 30–31°. The product is stored in a dark bottle in the ice chest and.
B. N-Nitroso-N-(2-phenylethyl)benzamide. A solution of 10.4 g. (0.046 mole) of the crude N-(2-phenylethyl)benzamide, 7.36 g. (0.09 mole) of anhydrous sodium acetate, and 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid is placed in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a drying tube, and the mixture is cooled to the crystallization point of the acetic acid. A solution of dinitrogen tetroxide, in glacial acetic acid (85 ml. of a solution approximately 1M in N2O4) is then added with stirring. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to about 15° (15 minutes), and then it is poured into a mixture of ice and water. The yellow solid nitroso derivative is dissolved in 75 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, and this solution is washed with 5% sodium bicarbonate, water, and dried. The solution is used directly in the next step.
For purification, the crude product is dissolved in 100 cc. of redistilled methanol, filtered through a warm funnel, and allowed to crystallize. After several hours the crystals are filtered, and the filtrate is chilled and filtered as before. A total of 80–90 g. (68–76 per cent of the theoretical amount) of methyl oxalate, melting at 52.5–53.5°, is obtained.
Finely ground elemental tellurium (13.40 g, 105 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (THF, 400 mL) are placed under nitrogen (N2) in a flame-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a N2 inlet, 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a rubber septum. Into the mixture is added ca. 65.5 mL (1.6 N in hexane, ca. 105 mmol) of butyllithium dropwise with a syringe through the septum with stirring at room temperature until the mixture becomes a pale yellow homogeneous solution. The solution is stirred for 10 min, then cooled to −78°C. Diethylcarbamoyl chloride (12.7 mL, 13.56 g, 100 mmol) is injected through the septum with a syringe, and the solution is stirred at −78°C for 10 min. The cold bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature, then stirred for 1 hr. It is cooled again to −78°C, and 62.5 mL (1.6 N, 100 mmol) of butyllithium is injected over a 3-min period. After the solution is stirred at −78°C for 5 min, 13.42 g (100 mmol) of 3-phenylpropanal in 50 mL of THF is added from the dropping funnel over a 5-min period. The mixture is stirred for 10 min, warmed to room temperature, and stirred for 1 hr. The mixture is poured into 200 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted with diethyl ether (Et2O) three times, 30 mL each. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at ca. 5 mm. The residual yellowish brown oil is chromatographed (silica gel, 50 mm × 25 cm). The first, pale yellow fraction eluted with ca. 400 mL of hexane contains dibutyl telluride (23.62 g, 93% based on tellurium used). The next 500-mL fraction (eluted with hexane/Et2O, 10/1) contains by-products. The desired product is eluted in the third fraction (ca. 500 mL of Et2O) that is concentrated on a rotary evaporator and distilled to afford 19.35 g of N,N-diethyl-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutanamide as a pale yellow viscous oil (bp 155–156°C at 0.6 mm, 82%),(Note 11),(Note 12).
B. cis-1,2-Cyclohexanedimethanol dimethanesulfonate. A 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, immersed in an ice–salt bath and fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an addition funnel, is charged with a solution of 111 g. (0.969 mole) of methanesulfonyl chloride in 1.2. l of pyridine. While cooling and stirring, a solution of 46.4 g. (0.322 mole) of cis-1,2-cyclohexanedimethanol in 250 ml. of pyridine is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature does not exceed 0°. Upon completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred at −5° to 0° for an additional 2 hours. Two liters of cold, 10% hydrochloric acid is introduced at a rate which maintains the reaction mixture below 20°. The solid which separates is isolated by suction filtration, washed sequentially with 1 l. of dilute hydrochloric acid and 2 l. of water, and air-dried, yielding 93–95 g. (96–98%) of the dimethanesulfonate, m.p. 66–67.5°. Recrystallization from methanol gives needles melting at 75–76°.
The reserved solid from filtration is dried under reduced pressure, dissolved in 65 mL of hot tetrahydrofuran and filtered. The solution is allowed to cool, first at room temperature, then in the freezer. The product (16.77 g, mp 138–139°C) is collected as before. The mother liquor is concentrated to about 10 mL, brought to the cloud point by the addition of hexane, and cooled in the freezer, resulting in an additional crop of 1.70 g, mp 138–139°C. The total amount of iodolactam is 19.80 g, representing a 79% yield from the amide.
C. Heptanal. A dry, 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, and 650 ml. of anhydrous dichloromethane is added. Stirring is begun and 77.5 g. (0.300 mole) of dipyridine chromium(VI) oxide is added at room temperature, followed by 5.8 g. (0.050 mole) of 1-heptanol in one portion. After stirring for 20 minutes, the supernatant solution is decanted from the insoluble brown gum, which is washed with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether and dichloromethane solutions are combined and washed successively with 300 ml. of aqueous 5% sodium hydroxide, 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid, two 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and, finally, with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation. Distillation of the residual oil at reduced pressure through a small Claisen head separates 4.0–4.8 g. (70–84%) of heptanal, b.p. 80–84° (65 mm.), n25D 1.4094.
The cooled reaction mixture is extracted with four portions of ether (400 ml., 250 ml., 200 ml., 200 ml.) The ether extracts are filtered and combined, and about two-thirds of the ether is distilled. The ethereal solution is transferred to a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and the remaining ether is removed. The residue (about 160 g.) is dissolved in 200 ml. of 24% hydrochloric acid (1 part water, 2 parts concentrated hydrochloric acid) and the solution distilled until the boiling point reaches 108° The solution is cooled and allowed to stand at 5° for about 20 hours. The product is collected by vacuum filtration and dried in a vacuum desiccator containing both concentrated sulfuric acid and potassium hydroxide pellets. The yield of α-ethyl-α-methylsuccinic acid is 65–75 g. (41–47%), m.p. 91–97°. Concentration of the mother liquor to 125 ml. gives an additional 8–9 g. of acid, m.p. 85–91°.
In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, 25 g. (0.13 mole) of tryptamine hydrochloride is dissolved in 400 ml. of water by stirring and warming on a steam bath to approximately 45°. After cooling to room temperature, a solution of 13.2 g. (0.143 mole) of glyoxylic acid monohydrate in 30 ml. of water is added followed by the slow addition (about 3 minutes) of a cooled solution of 7.05 g. (0.126 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 35 ml. of water. Precipitation of tetrahydro-β-carboline-1-carboxylic acid takes place during the addition of the potassium hydroxide solution or soon thereafter. After stirring at ambient temperature for 1 hour, the solid is collected on a filter and washed thoroughly with 100 ml. of water. The damp filter cake is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and suspended in 240 ml. of water; 34 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is slowly added with stirring. The mixture is boiled on a hot plate for 30 minutes before an additional 35 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. Heating is continued for another 15 minutes, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The precipitated hydrochloride salt is collected on a filter and washed with 30 ml. of water. The product is dissolved in 400 ml. of water by stirring and warming on a steam bath to approximately 55°, and the solution is adjusted to pH 12 with 20% aqueous potassium hydroxide (approximately 50 ml. is required). After cooling to room temperature, the product is collected by suction filtration, washed with 400 ml. of water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide, yielding 17.0–17.6 g. (78–80%) of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-β-carboline, m.p. 204–205°; 1H NMR spectrum (dimethyl sulfoxide-d6): δ 2.70 (t, 2H, CH2CH2N), 2.72 (s, 1H, NH), 3.00 (t, 2H, CH2CH2N), 3.85 (s, 2H, CCH2N), 6.80–7.50 (m, 4H, C6H4), and 10.53 (s, 1H, NH).
(A) N-Phenylanthranilic Acid.—In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an air-cooled condenser, a mixture of 155 g. (1.66 moles) of aniline, 41 g. (0.26 mole) of o-chlorobenzoic acid, 41 g. (0.3 mole) of technical anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 1 g. of copper oxide is refluxed for two hours, using an oil bath. The excess aniline is removed by distillation with steam (about three hours is required), and 20 g. of decolorizing carbon is added to the brown residual solution. The mixture is boiled for fifteen minutes and filtered by suction. The filtrate is added, with stirring, to a mixture of 30 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 60 cc. of water. The precipitated acid is filtered with suction when cold. After drying to constant weight in the air, the yield is 46–52 g. (82–93 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a nearly white product; m.p. 179–181° with preliminary shrinking,, and.
B. Ethyl 3-ethyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolecarboxylate. Ethyl β-pyrrolidinocrotonate (183 g., 1.00 mole), 1-nitropropane (115 g., 116 ml., 1.29 mole), and triethylamine (400 ml.) are dissolved in 1 l. of chloroform and placed in a 5-l., three-necked flask fitted with a 500 ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a gas-inlet tube. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, and its contents are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere. While the contents of the flask are stirred magnetically, a solution of 170 g. (1.11 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride in 200 ml. of chloroform is added slowly from the dropping funnel. After 3 hours, addition is complete and the ice bath is removed. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for an additional 15 hours.
In a 50-mL, round-bottomed glass reactor equipped with a magnetic stirring bar are placed 13.60 g (74 mmol) of myrcene, 10.29 g (141 mmol) of diethylamine, and 0.185 g (0.0267 g-atom) of metallic lithium cut into small pieces. The vessel is flushed with dry nitrogen, and is sealed. The solution is heated to 55°C in a water bath, and is stirred for 5 hr. The vessel is cooled to room temperature and the contents are poured into 30 mL of ice–water. The upper organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 20-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layer is washed with aqueous sodium sulfate solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residual liquid affords 1.2–2.0 g of unreacted myrcene and 12.66–13.28 g (74–77%) of the product as a colorless liquid, bp 67–68°C (0.5 mm). GLC analysis indicated that the product contained 91.2–92.5% of N,N-diethylgeranylamine and other isomers.
Eighteen hundred milliliters of benzene and 350 g. of finely ground anhydrous aluminum chloride (2.6 moles) are placed in a 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel containing 153 g. (1 mole) of fumaryl chloride (p. 422), and a reflux condenser. A trap for absorbing hydrogen chloride is attached to the condenser.
The flask is cooled in an ice bath and a solution of 55.5 g. (0.75 mole) of pure ethyl formate in 100 cc. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. The stirrer is started and the ethyl formate solution is added at such a rate that the ether refluxes gently. This addition requires about one-half hour. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring is continued for ten minutes.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, is placed 630 g. (670 ml., 7 moles) of β-ethoxyethyl alcohol. The stirrer is started, and 600 g. (210 ml., 2.2 moles) of phosphorus tribromide is added from the dropping funnel over a period of 1.5–2 hours. The temperature is permitted to rise until the reaction mixture refluxes gently.
C. RuCl[(S,S)-NTsCH(C6H5)CH(C6H5)NH2(η6-cymene) (3).. A one-necked, flame-dried, 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum fitted with an argon inlet needle is flushed with argon. The septum is temporarily removed and the flask is charged with CH2Cl2 (6 mL), (1S,2S)-(+)-N-p-toluenesulfonyl-1,2-diphenylethylene-diamine (126 mg, 0.34 mmol), dichloro(p-cymene)ruthenium(II) dimer (107 mg, 0.17 mmol), and powdered KOH (141 mg, 2.5 mmol). The resulting orange mixture is stirred for 5 min at room temperature and then distilled H2O (6 mL) is added in one portion by means of a syringe. The resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 10 min during which time the organic phase turns dark purple. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, diluted with 10 mL of H2O and the layers are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over CaH2, filtered and solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator (40 °C, water aspirator pressure) to furnish the catalyst 3 (180–182 mg, 86–87%) as a dark purple solid that is used in the subsequent reduction without additional purification.
3,3'-Dimethoxybiphenyl2 (8 g., 0.037 mole) is dissolved in 120 ml. of methylene chloride in a 250-ml. conical flask, and the flask is placed in an acetone-dry ice bath at −80°. The flask is fitted with an air condenser. A solution of 15.9 g. (6.0 ml., 0.063 mole) of boron tribromide, in 40 ml. of methylene chloride, is added carefully to the stirred solution through the condenser. When the addition is complete, a calcium chloride tube is fitted to the top of the air condenser in order to protect the reaction mixture from moisture. As the solution of boron tribromide is added, a white precipitate is formed. The reaction mixture is allowed to attain room temperature overnight with stirring, when a clear, brownish yellow solution is obtained. The reaction mixture is then hydrolyzed by careful shaking with 130 ml. of water, thus precipitating a white solid which is dissolved by the addition of 500 ml. of ether. The organic layer is separated and extracted with 240 ml. of 2N sodium hydroxide; the alkaline extract is neutralized with dilute hydrochloric acid, extracted with 300 ml. of ether, and the ether extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. On removal of the ether under reduced pressure, a brownish yellow oil remains which soon crystallizes to give an off-white solid; this is recrystallized twice from hot benzene, the first time with the addition of charcoal, and gives 3,3'-dihydroxybiphenyl as white needles with a pinkish tint, m.p. 126–127°. The yield is 5.4–6.0 g. (77–86%).
B. 3,5-Dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. The ether solution of crude 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one obtained as described above is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. The ether is removed on a steam cone, perferably with the aid of an aspirator, and there are added 1140 ml. of water, 60 ml. of ethanol (95%), and 130 g. of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is shaken continuously and heated on a steam cone until the alkali dissolves, and heating is continued on a steam cone with frequent shaking until the ester dissolves. The solution is then refluxed for 15 minutes.
The solution obtained by the hydrolysis of dihydropyran is placed in the separatory funnel, and about 10 ml. is added to the nitric acid solution at a temperature below 0°. After the evolution of brown nitrogen dioxide fumes begins (in about 10 minutes), the addition is continued at a rate that allows the temperature to be held below 10°. The addition requires about 3 hours and. When the addition is completed, the blue-green solution is stirred for an additional 1.5 hours as brown fumes continue to be evolved. The cooling bath then is removed and stirring is continued as the temperature is allowed to rise slowly to 25–30°. As the reaction nears completion, the color changes from blue-green to green to light yellow. Appearance of the light yellow color indicates the end of the reaction and normally requires 2 to 3 hours after the addition is completed. The volume of the solution then is reduced either by evaporation on a steam bath or by distillation under reduced pressure.
When the reaction has progressed to the desired stage, the flow of air is stopped and the mixture is filtered. After the filtrate has been extracted with two 350-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°), the combined hydrocarbon extracts are washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 2N hydrochloric acid and three 100-ml. portions of water. The petroleum ether is distilled from the solution, heated in a water bath, through a 60-cm. Vigreux column, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction, b.p. 64–65° (1.0 mm.) or 132–134° (35 mm.), is collected as 39.5–52.0 g. (64–85%) of colorless liquid, n25D 1.4846–1.4850. This distillation fraction contains 80–90% of the cis-cyclododecene (51–76%) accompanied by 10–20% of a mixture of cyclododecane and cis,trans-1,5-cyclododecadiene. If desired, the cis-cyclododecene may be further purified by preparative chromatography or separation of the silver nitrate-olefin addition complex.
It is advantageous, though not essential, to inoculate the mixture with a little powdered benzalacetophenone after stirring for one-half hour. After two to three hours, the mixture becomes so thick that the stirring is no longer effective. The stirrer is then removed and the mixture left to itself in an ice box for about ten hours. The mixture now is a thick paste composed of small shot-like grains suspended in an almost colorless liquid. It is cooled in a freezing mixture and then either centrifuged or filtered on a large Büchner funnel, washed with water until the washings are neutral to litmus, and finally washed with 200 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, which has previously been cooled to 0°. After thorough drying in the air, the crude product weighs about 880 g. (97 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 50–54°. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes but tenaciously holds traces of water. It is most readily purified by recrystallization from four to four and one-half times its weight of 95 per cent alcohol. Eight hundred and eighty grams of crude product give 770 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of light yellow material (m. p. 55–57°) and 40–50 g. that require recrystallization.
B. 2,7-Dimethylnaphthalene . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, nitrogen inlet adapter and a 300-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a rubber septum. All the glassware is oven-dried before assembly. Under a flow of nitrogen, the flask is charged with crystalline 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene (70.3 g; 0.196 mol) , the catalyst NiCl2(dppp)2 (1.90 g; 3.51 mmol, 1.8 mol % relative to 2,7-bis(N,N-diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene, Note 6) and anhydrous diethyl ether (550 mL , Note 7). A red mixture is obtained. The dropping funnel is charged with an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide (3 M in diethyl ether, 235 mL, 0.705 mol , Note 8), which is added dropwise over a period of 25 min. During the addition, the reaction mixture changes from red to pale brown and to green. The mixture is stirred at 30°C for 13 hr in order to complete the reaction. TLC is used to follow the reaction [SiO2, 2,7-bis(diethylcarbamoyloxy)naphthalene, Rf = 0.10; 2,7-dimethylnaphthalene, Rf = 0.74, (hexane/ethyl acetate: 80/20)]. The resulting dark brown mixture is cooled in an ice bath and the dropping funnel is charged with aqueous hydrochloric acid (6 M, 300 mL), which is slowly added to the reaction mixture over 25 min in order to maintain a gentle reflux. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted further with diethyl ether (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with aqueous hydrochloric acid (6 M, 3 × 100 mL), distilled water (150 mL), brine (200 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration and evaporation of the solvent, the compound is dried under vacuum to a constant weight, to afford a beige solid (30.2 g). The crude product is recrystallized from boiling 95% ethanol (350 mL) to give colorless crystals of 2,7-dimethylnaphthalene (22.1 g). Concentration of the mother liquors and another recrystallization, provides an additional amount of product (5.3 g). 2,7-Dimethylnaphthalene (overall: 27.4 g, 0.175 mol, 89%, mp 95-96°C , lit.7: mp 95-96°C, is obtained as fluffy colorless leaflet crystals.
C. (R)-(+)-1,1'-Bi-2-naphthol. Toluene in the above filtrate is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue is recrystallized from methanol (500 mL) overnight at 4°C. Yellow crystals (125–141 g) form and are collected by filtration and washed twice with 20 mL of hexane. Recrystallization from 500 mL of methanol yields pure (R)-binaphthol dipentanoate [mp 63–65°C, 89–102 g, >99% ee (R), [α]D19 +15.0 ± 0.3° (CHCl3, c 0.4),]. If desired, an additional 25 g of dipentanoate can be isolated from the filtrate by column chromatography on 1 kg of silica gel eluted with methylene chloride followed by crystallization.
The extract is dried for one hour with about 30 g. of calcium chloride and filtered, and the solvent is distilled from a steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure with a short column (p. 130). Some low-boiling material comes over first, and then the temperature rises rapidly. If care has been taken in the water decomposition to remove all the aluminum salts, the product comes over water-white and crystallizes to a white solid melting at 49–50.5°. The yield is 340–395 g. (69–79 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product boiling over a 3° range and. On redistillation the boiling point is 117°/7 mm.; 129–130°/15 mm.; and 255.5°/736 mm.
The mixture is stirred for 2 hr in the ice bath and for 2 hr at room temperature, then poured into a large Erlenmeyer flask containing 150 mL of 1 N hydrochloric acid and 200 mL of ice/water mixture. Hexane (400 mL) is added and the quenched reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min. Solid material is removed by vacuum filtration and the solids are washed with hexane (3 × 70 mL). The combined filtrates are transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is removed. The aqueous layer is extracted with 300 mL of hexane and the extract is combined with the original organic layer. After the organic layer is washed successively with 300-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and brine, it is dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 24.8 g of crude product. The crude product is placed on a chromatography column prepared from 550 g of silica gel and hexane. The column is eluted with 2% ethyl acetate in hexane until 3.5 L of eluant has been collected. Then 4% ethyl acetate in hexane is used. The fractions containing the product (TLC) are combined and evaporated, finally under high vacuum, to afford 15.4 g (61%) of a very pale yellow liquid. GC analysis of this product on an OV17 50-m capillary column (100°C to 200°C at 5°C/min) shows it to be 98.2% pure.
A. 2-Methyl-2-nitropropane. To a well-stirred suspension of 650 g. (4.11 moles) of potassium permanganate in 3 l. of water, contained in a 5-l., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel, is added, dropwise and with stirring over a 10- minute period, 100 g. (1.37 moles) of tert-butylamine. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to 55° over a period of approximately 2 hours, and maintained at 55° with continuous stirring for 3 hours. The dropping funnel and reflux condenser are replaced with a stopper and a still head fitted for steam distillation, and the product is steam distilled from the reaction mixture. The liquid product is separated from the denser water layer, diluted with 250 ml. of diethyl ether, and washed successively with two 50-ml. portions of 2 M hydrochloric acid and 50 ml. of water. After the ethereal solution has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solution is fractionally distilled at atmospheric pressure, removing the ether. The residual crude product totals 106–128 g. and is sufficiently pure for use in the next step. In a typical run, distillation of 124 g. of the crude product affords 110 g. (78%) of the pure 2-methyl-2-nitropropane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 127–128°, n25D 1.3992, which slowly solidifies on standing to a waxy solid, m.p. 25–26°.
B. 2-(N,N-Dimethylamino)phenyllithium. A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen-inlet tube is capped with serum stoppers and flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 18.2 g (0.150 mol) of N,N-dimethylaniline and 33.4 mL (0.050 mol) of a 1.50 M solution of butyllithium in hexane. While a continuous positive nitrogen pressure is maintained, the solution is heated at reflux (in a 90–95°C bath) with stirring for 20 hr and then cooled to room temperature.
The crude product is purified by recrystallization from hot ordinary methyl alcohol. On account of the low solubility of the dinitroanisole in hot methyl alcohol, the best results are obtained by boiling the crude product with a few grams of decolorizing carbon (Norite) in about 500 cc. of methyl alcohol, filtering the hot solution through a hot funnel, cooling the solution, filtering, and using the mother liquors for another extraction. After five extractions no more of the product is dissolved. The yield of pure product melting at 105° is 29–35 g. (63–77 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mother liquor is returned to the reaction flask, the apparatus reassembled, and the passage of phosgene resumed. When the rate of absorption has noticeably decreased (1–1.5 hours) the precipitated isatoic anhydride is collected on a filter and washed. The second crop amounts to 34–54 g. A third passage of phosgene at a considerably reduced rate will often yield a small additional crop (10–24 g.) of isatoic anhydride.
(4R,5S)-4-Hydroxymethyl-(5-O-tert-butyldimethylsiloxymethyl)furan-2(5H)-one . A 1-L Pyrex vessel is charged with 29.5 g (0.13 mol) of (5S)-(5-O-tert-butyldimethylsiloxymethyl)furan-2(5H)-one , 23.7 g (0.13 mol) of benzophenone and 800 mL of methanol . The vessel is placed in a water-cooled, immersion-irradiation apparatus, and the solution is degassed for 1 hr in a stream of nitrogen. It is then irradiated using two 125-watt, 350-nm lamps; the reaction is complete after 48 hr. The solvent is evaporated and the residue is purified by silica chromatography [ 1 kg of silica, 8.5-cm × 43-cm column with a gradient elution from ethyl acetate:petroleum ether (1:1) to neat ethyl acetate]. This yields 18.5 g (55%) of the title compound, 18.3 g (77%) of recovered benzophenone, 3.6 g of benzpinacol , and 1.56 g (3%) of the photoadduct (4R,5S)-4-diphenylhydroxymethyl-5-tert-butyldimethylsiloxymethylfuran-2(5H)-one . The title photoadduct is an oil with [α] D 20 +3.2° (in chloroform, c 2.0).
D. cis-8-Thiabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane 8,8-dioxide [benzo[c]thiophene 2,2-dioxide, cis-octahydro-]. A solution of the sulfide (43.0 g., 0.303 mole) in 1 l. of ether is cooled to 0°, stirred magnetically, and treated dropwise with 1.0 l. of 0.65 N ethereal monoperphthalic acid [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 3, 619 (1955)]. The mixture is kept overnight at 0°, after which time the precipitated phthalic acid is separated by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Bulb-to-bulb distillation of the residual oil at 0.05–0.1 mm. affords the sulfone as a colorless liquid (48.5–50 g., 92–95%). This product is crystallized from ether-hexane, yielding a colorless solid, m.p. 39–41°.
B. 2-t-Butyl-3-phenyloxazirane. A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with an addition funnel, stirrer, and condenser is charged with 68.0 g. (0.422 mole) of N-t-buylbenzaldimine and 50 ml. of benzene. The stirred solution is cooled in an ice bath and a solution of 61 g. (0.445 mole) of perbenzoic acid in 315 ml. of benzene is added dropwise over a 40-minute period. After one additional hour the stirrer is stopped, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight with the concurrent melting of the ice bath. The light blue benzene solution is then filtered to remove the precipitated benzoic acid and is washed sequentially with three 100-ml. portions of sodium carbonate, 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid, 100 ml. of saturated sodium bisulfite solution, and finally with 100 ml. of water. The solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated at room temperature at aspirator pressure. There is obtained 46–60 g. (60–78%) of crude oxazirane, n26D 1.5065. This product assays 96–98% purity by iodimetric titration and is sufficiently pure for many purposes. Distillation of the crude product through a short Vigreux column yields, after a few drops of forerun, 42–55 g. (56–74%) of pure oxazirane, n26D 1.5062, n20D 1.5144, b.p. 55–58° (0.05 mm.), 74–76° (0.2 mm.). Iodimetric assay of this product indicates a purity of 99–100%.
Five hundred grams (402 cc., 4.9 moles) of 90 per cent glycerol and 10 g. of glacial acetic acid are mixed in a weighed 1-l. flask, which is placed in an oil bath heated to 105–110°. A rapid stream of dry hydrogen chloride is introduced into the mixture. The flask is removed from the bath from time to time and reweighed. At the end of about four hours the flask will have gained 190 g. in weight. The reaction is then complete.
The yellowish solution is transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flask and cooled with running water while 300 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added slowly from a separatory funnel. This acidification process requires thirty minutes, during which time the temperature should not rise much above 25°. The liquid froths and about 30 g. of benzoic acid separates but it is not filtered. Extraction of the reaction mixture with 200-cc. portions of ether until 1500 cc. of extract has been collected is now carried out in a separatory funnel. The ether is distilled on a steam bath from a 1-l. round-bottomed, wide-necked flask connected with a water condenser, the extract being added from a separatory funnel as fast as the ether distils. After most of the ether has been removed, the heating is continued for an additional one-half hour.
The dry barium salt is placed in a 2-l. flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, 600 cc. of water is added, and the mixture heated to boiling. The calculated quantity of 5 N sulfuric acid is introduced gradually from a separatory funnel into the well-stirred mixture over a period of about one hour. The mixture is then centrifuged or filtered with suction through a thin layer of fuller's earth. The barium sulfate precipitate is transferred to a beaker and extracted with two 250-cc. portions of boiling water. The filtrate and washings are transferred to a distilling flask placed in a water bath and concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 175–200 cc.. The syrupy residue is poured into a large beaker and treated with 500 cc. of absolute methyl alcohol. Crystals of the acid begin to appear at once. The mixture is allowed to stand for three or four hours in an ice bath to complete the precipitation, and the crystalline solid is separated by filtration with suction. After being washed with two 75-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, the product is dried at 100°. The methyliminodiacetic acid forms fine, white crystals, m.p. 215°, and weighs 92–105 g. (63–71 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer and a mechanical stirrer with Teflon blades is charged with a solution of the reaction product in 750 mL of ether. The contents of the flask are cooled in an ice–water bath to 3°C. To the flask is added a precooled (3°C) solution of 20 g (0.50 mol) of sodium hydroxide in 500 mL of brine. The two-phase mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hr with continued cooling and then is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 150-mL portions of ether and. The combined organic solution is dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Solvent removal with a rotary evaporator at 35°C (70 mm) followed by concentration with the rotary evaporator at 35°C (12 mm) for 1.0 hr gives 24.7–25.0 g of crude (2S,3S)-3-propyloxiranemethanol as a pale-amber oil.
A 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser topped with a tube containing soda lime and calcium chloride. In this flask are placed 38 g. (1 mole) of pulverized lithium aluminum hydride and 400 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran. The mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 15 minutes or until most of the lithium aluminum hydride has dissolved. A solution of 90.5 g. (0.8 mole) of 5,5-dimethyl-2-pyrrolidone (p.357) in 200 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added slowly at such a rate that the solvent refluxes gently without external heating. When the addition is complete and the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is stirred and heated at gentle reflux for 8 hours.
The reaction mixture is heated by means of an oil bath (inside temperature 130–135°) for 2 hours, care being taken to avoid overheating, and then allowed to cool to 90–95°. The fumaryl chloride is distilled as rapidly as possible (20 minutes), and the portion boiling over a 25° range (60–85°/13–14 mm.) is collected. It is then redistilled slowly (1 hour), and the portion boiling over a 2° range (62–64°/13 mm.) is collected. The yield is 125–143 g. (82–95%) and.
One hundred fifty grams (0.59 mole) of iodine is dissolved in 2.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask set on a tripod and provided with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. To this solution is added 300 g. (0.84 mole) of powdered dry crude p-chloromercuribenzoic acid (p. 159). The mixture is stirred and heated. The acid gradually goes into solution and the color of iodine disappears. The hot stirred mixture is treated with iodine until a yellow color persists for at least ten minutes. This is conveniently done by weighing out iodine in 10-g. portions, dissolving in a little alcohol, and adding through the condenser. The total amount of iodine required depends on the purity of the mercurated acid. It should not exceed 210 g. (0.83 mole)If any insoluble material is left after an excess of iodine has been added, it is removed by rapid filtration through a preheated suction filter.
B. 4-Phenyl-1-carbethoxysemicarbazide. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a constant-pressure dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube containing silica gel is charged with a solution of 52 g. (0.50 mole) of ethyl hydrazinecarboxylate in 550 ml. of dry benzene. After the solution is cooled with an ice bath, stirring is begun and 59.7 g. (54.5 ml., 0.501 mole) of phenyl isocyanate is added dropwise to the solution over a 45-minute period. After about one-half of the isocyanate has been added, a white precipitate of the product appears, and the reaction mixture becomes progressively thicker. After addition is complete the ice bath is removed; the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours, then heated under reflux for 2 hours. The suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, and 4-phenyl-1-carbethoxysemicarbazide is isolated by suction filtration, washed with 500 ml. of benzene, and dried in a vacuum desiccator, yielding 108 g. (97%) of 4-phenyl-1-carbethoxysemicarbazide, m.p. 151–152°. The product is not further purified for use in the next step, but may be recrystallized from ethyl acetate to yield white crystals, m.p. 154–155°; IR cm.−1 1645, 1687, 1797, and 3300.
A 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask is attached to a 250-ml. dropping funnel and a total-condensation variable take-off fractionating column with a 20 by 1.2 cm. section packed with glass helices. The fractionating column is fitted to a 500-ml. receiving flask. In the reaction flask are placed 12.5 g. of powdered fused potassium acid sulfate and 0.05 g. of p-tert-butylcatechol. The flask is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 220–230°, and 145 g. (0.925 mole) of m-chlorophenylmethylcarbinol (p. 200) and 0.05 g. of p-tert-butylcatechol are placed in the dropping funnel. The system is evacuated to a pressure of 125 mm., maintained by a manostat, and the m-chlorophenylmethylcarbinol is added dropwise at a rate (15–20 drops per minute) which maintains a vapor temperature at 110–120° at the top of the column. The m-chlorostyrene and water formed are collected in a receiver. When the addition is completed (5.5–8.5 hours) the pressure is held constant until distillation stops, and it is then reduced to 20 mm. until no more liquid distils.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer and a reflux condenser is placed 200 g. of amalgamated mossy zinc. A mixture of 200 ml. of water and 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and then a solution of 60 g. of o-heptanoyl phenol in 100 ml. of ethanol. The mixture is agitated vigorously and refluxed until reduction is complete.
B. Inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide. A two-necked, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a condenser to which a calcium chloride drying tube is attached. A solution of 23.0 g. (31.8 ml., 0.225 mole) of anhydrous triethylamine in 50 ml. of anhydrous benzene is placed in the flask, stirring is begun, and a solution of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of methyl (chlorosulfonyl)carbamate in 225 ml. of dried benzene is added dropwise over 1 hour. During addition the flask is cooled with a water bath maintained at 10–15°. The resulting mixture is stirred at 25–30° for an additional 0.5 hour then filtered to remove triethylamine hydrochloride (13.8 g.). Evaporation of the filtrate under reduced pressure leaves 22–23 g. of light tan needles, m.p. 70–72° (dec.), which is dissolved in 160 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran at 30°. On cooling, 20.0–20.6 g. (84–86%) of the inner salt of methyl (carboxysulfamoyl)triethylammonium hydroxide precipitates as colorless needles, m.p. 70–72° (dec.).
About half of the sodium ethoxide solution is poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask provided with a liquid-sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser; the other half is kept warm by a small flame. The first half of the solution is allowed to cool until a solid begins to appear, then 58 g. of dry acetone mixed with 150 g. of ethyl oxalate is added at once and the stirrer is set in motion. Heat is evolved, and the liquid turns brown but remains clear. As soon as any turbidity appears, the other half of the hot sodium ethoxide solution is poured into the mixture together with 160 g. of ethyl oxalate, the two streams being allowed to mix as they flow into the flask. The liquid initially is clear and of a deep brown color, but after stirring for about thirty minutes the mixture becomes practically solid. The flask is then connected with a condenser for distillation and heated in an oil bath at 110° until 150 cc. of alcohol has distilled. The flask is protected by a calcium chloride tube and the reaction mixture is cooled to 20°. The sodium derivative is removed to a 3-l. beaker by means of a glass rod and treated with a mixture of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 800 g. of cracked ice. All lumps are carefully crushed, and the creamy yellow suspension of acetonedioxalic ester is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel. The ester is removed from the filter, stirred with about 100 cc. of ice water, and again collected. For hydrolysis the crude material is heated with 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 5-l. flask on the steam bath for twenty hours. After cooling to 20° the solid hydrated acid is collected on a 10-cm. Büchner funnel, washed with two 50-cc. portions of ice water, and dried, first at 100° for two hours, and then at 160° to constant weight to remove the water of crystallization. The yield of product decomposing at 257° (corr.) is 140–145 g. (76–79 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Pentadecanal dimethyl acetal. The crude material obtained from Part A is placed in a 2-l., three-necked flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, a reflux condenser with drying tube, and a stopper. Methanol (1 l., reagent grade) is added, the stirrer is started, and 40 g. (0.18 mole) of mercury(II) oxide and 100 g. (0.368 mole) of mercury(II) chloride are introduced. The mixture is heated under reflux for 4.5 hours and filtered through a Büchner funnel after cooling. The residue is washed with 300 ml. of pentane, and the combined organic solutions are poured into 1 l. of water. The layers are separated, and the lower aqueous layer is shaken with two 500-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic layers are quickly washed with 10% ammonium acetate solution and water and dried over sodium sulfate. The pentane is evaporated under reduced pressure, giving 30.0–32.5 g. of the crude acetal as a mobile, slightly yellow oil.
The apparatus is shown in Fig. 16. Phosgene is introduced at one end of the apparatus, and gentle suction is applied at the other. In the 5-l. flask, A, 500 cc. of dry ethyl acetate is saturated with phosgene at room temperature. The phosgene is purified by bubbling it through cottonseed oil, B, to remove chlorine, and then through concentrated sulfuric acid, C, as shown in the figure. A solution of 150 g. (1.09 moles) of p-nitroaniline in 1.5 l. of dry ethyl acetate is run in slowly from the separatory funnel, D, over a period of three to four hours. The addition of the p-nitroaniline solution must be at such a rate that the precipitate of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride that is formed at first is allowed to dissolve and not accumulate. During this time a steady stream of phosgene is passed through the solution to ensure an excess. Towards the end of the reaction, the solution must be boiled gently with a Bunsen flame to break up the lumps of p-nitroaniline hydrochloride which otherwise dissolve very slowly.
After the addition of 2 l. of water, the mixture is steam-distilled as long as any oil comes over. The crude, heavy, yellow oil is separated and washed with two 200-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide, once with 100 cc. of water, twice with 150-cc. portions of concentrated sulfuric acid, and finally with 100 cc. of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution. It is dried with about 5 g. of calcium chloride, filtered through glass wool, and distilled using a long air condenser. Most of the product boils at 180–183°/750 mm. The yield of pure colorless material, b.p. 183°/760 mm., is 125–135 g. (36–39 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the amount of p-toluidine originally used (p. 111), or 54–59 per cent based on the amount of 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and an efficient fractionation column fitted with either a vapor- or liquid-splitting head is placed 400 ml. of mineral oil. The oil is heated to 240–270° and dicyclopentadiene is added at the rate of 5–10 ml. per minute. The reflux ratio and the rate of addition of dicyclopentadiene are adjusted to maintain the distillation head temperature at 40°. The cyclopentadiene is collected in a Dry Ice-acetone receiver.
A. tert-Butyl phenyl(phenylsulfonyl)methylcarbamate (1).2 A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a glass stopper and an argon inlet. The flask is flushed with argon and charged with tert-butyl carbamate (13.00 g, 110.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and 40 mL of tetrahydrofuran. Water (100 mL), sodium benzenesulfinate (18.21 g, 110.9 mmol, 1.00 equiv), and freshly distilled benzaldehyde (11.48 mL, 113.1 mmol, 1.02 equiv) are sequentially added in single portions, followed by formic acid (99%, 24.3 mL, 643 mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred for 18 h at room temperature under an argon atmosphere, during which time the desired product precipitates. The resulting white solid is filtered through a Büchner funnel (diameter 100 mm) and washed with distilled water (200 mL). The solid is transferred to a 500-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask and is slurried in a mixture of hexane/dichloromethane (150/15 mL). The mixture is stirred for 2 h at room temperature, after which time it is collected by filtration in a Büchner funnel (diameter 100 mm) and washed with hexane/dichloromethane (91/9 mL). The solid is transferred to a 300-mL round-bottomed flask and dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mmHg) at 25 °C for 6 h to afford 30.79 g (80%) of the title compound 1 as a white solid.
The combined product is suspended in 400 cc. of water and dissolved by adding 8 g. of sodium hydroxide in 20–30 cc. of water; 2 g. of Norite is added, and the solution filtered. The residue is washed on the funnel with 20–30 cc. of hot distilled water. The filtrate is heated to boiling and treated with 13 cc. of hydrochloric acid, when crystallization usually begins. The mixture is then acidified to litmus with acetic acid and allowed to stand overnight in the refrigerator. The resulting tyrosine is filtered and washed with ice-cold distilled water (130–150 cc. is necessary) until the washings are free of chloride. The product is dried in air or in a vacuum oven. The yield is 17.0–18.2 g. of pure white, silky needles of tyrosine. A second crop (about 0.5 g.) of a slightly less pure product may be obtained on concentrating the mother liquor to about 120 cc.
When the reprecipitated m-nitroacetophenone (50–55 g.) is dry it is dissolved in 100 cc. of hot alcohol in a 300-cc. Erlenmeyer flask. The flask is then immersed in an ice bath and shaken vigorously while crystallization is taking place. Because of the great change in solubility between 60° and 50° the agitation of the liquid must be vigorous during this temperature interval, or large clumps of crystals will be formed instead of the purer and more easily dried mush. After the temperature has reached 20° (about one hour) the mixture is filtered by suction. The solid is washed with 10 cc. of ice-cold alcohol and pressed dry on a clay plate. The product is light yellow; it softens at 74° and melts at 76–78°. The total yield is 45 g. (55 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To 50 ml. of a well-cooled 6N sodium hydroxide solution is added, with stirring, 32 g. (0.15 mole) of the phosphite salt. The stirring is continued until all the solid has dissolved. The solution is transferred to a 125-ml. separatory funnel, extracted with three 20-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, the solvent removed under reduced pressure, and the glycine t-butyl ester distilled, b.p. 65–67° (20 mm.), n20D 1.4237, yield 14 g. (72%, based on phosphite salt). The overall yield from t-butyl chloroacetate is 50–55%.
In each of two ordinary 250-cc. (8-oz.) narrow-mouthed bottles are placed 32.1 g. (0.3 mole) of m-toluidine and 33 g. (23 cc., 0.3 mole) of ethyl bromide. The bottles are sealed with rubber stoppers wired tightly in place and then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours in a 2-l. beaker filled with water at room temperature. The white crystalline mass in each bottle is broken up and the amine is liberated by shaking with 150 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and 50 cc. of ether. The contents of the two flasks are combined, the lower aqueous layer is separated and discarded, and the ether solution of the amine is washed with 150 cc. of water. When the ether is distilled from a steam bath, the crude amine (90–92 g.) is obtained.
Then 1 l. of water is added and the mixture is distilled with steam until about 1.5 l. has passed over. The distillate is made alkaline with about 10 g. of powdered sodium hydroxide and the lower red layer of crude o-bromotoluene separated. This weighs about 140 g. It is washed with concentrated sulfuric acid, which removes almost all the color, and then twice with water. It is dried over a little calcium chloride, filtered and distilled twice from a modified Claisen flask (p. 130). The yield of pure product boiling at 178–181° is 110–120 g. (43–47 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mixture is stirred and heated in an oil bath at 70°C until the blue color discharges (ca. 3 hr), affording a white suspension of the lithium amide. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and potassium tert-butoxide (44 g, 0.4 mol,) is added to the flask using a powder funnel. The resultant pale yellow solution is stirred for 20 min at room temperature, and then 2-decyn-1-ol (15.4 g, 0.1 mol,) is added over 10 min by means of the dropping funnel. Residual 2-decyn-1-ol is washed into the flask with 1,3-diaminopropane (20 mL). The reddish-brown mixture is stirred for 30 min and then poured into 1 L of ice water and extracted 4 times with 500-mL portions of hexane. The hexane extracts are combined and washed succesively with 1 L each of water, 10% hydrochloric acid, and saturated sodium chloride solution. The hexane solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The crude product is distilled under reduced pressure to give 9-decyn-1-ol (12.8–13.5 g, 83–88%) and, as a colorless oil, bp 86–88°C/0.5 mm.
C. (Z)-3-Tributylstannylmethylene-4-isopropyl-1,1-cyclopentanedicarboxylic acid, dimethyl ester (3). A flame-dried, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with argon, and 23.8 g (0.100 mol) of dialkylmalonate diester (2), 30.2 g (<0.104 mol) of tributyltin hydride, and 40 mg (0.25 mmol) of azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) are added neat and. The entire assembly is lowered into an oil bath maintained at 75–85°C, and the mixture is stirred. After an induction period of less than 30 min, an exothermic reaction occurs and produces a small amount of gas and a rise in the temperature of the oil bath (as much as 20°C for a small bath). After this point TLC shows that the reaction is essentially complete(Note 16)(Note 17). Unpurified 3 thus obtained is suitable for protodestannylation.
The crude phenylurea is somewhat colored and contains a little carbanilide. It may be purified by dissolving in a minimum quantity of boiling water, adding a little decolorizing carbon, and filtering. When the filtrate first begins to cool, a flocculent precipitate of carbanilide is deposited; this must be filtered off while the liquid is still hot. The filtrate, on cooling, yields colorless stout needles or flakes of phenylurea melting at 147°. The total weight of pure product is 212–225 g. (52–55 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 1.0-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a septum cap is charged with a mixture of 67 g (0.80 mol) of sodium bicarbonate, 71.5 g (0.69 mol) of sodium bisulfite, and 200 mL of water. This mixture is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath to −20°C with vigorous stirring. Immediately the reaction mixture is added dropwise via cannula at a rate such that the temperature remains at −10°C. This addition takes 30–40 min. When approximately half of the reaction solution has been added, an additional 35.7 g (0.34 mol) of sodium bisulfite is added to the aqueous quench mixture. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 40 min at −10°C. The light-yellow mixture (pH 7) is extracted with three 500-mL portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 40°C at 70 mm. Final solvent removal with a vacuum pump gives a two-phase, oily mixture. The mixture is stirred with three 100-mL portions of hexane, and the hexane extracts are decanted and discarded. Removal of the final traces of solvent with a vacuum pump gives 16.1–22.8 g (44–62% yield based on chlorosulfonyl isocyanate) of a light-orange oil that slowly solidifies on standing at −20°C. The resulting solid melts at 34°C.
B. 3-(Methoxymethoxy)-1-butanol . A solution of 17.6 g (0.10 mol) of 1-acetoxy-3-(methoxymethoxy)butane in 100 mL of methanol is added to a solution of 35.0 g (0.253 mol) of potassium carbonate in 50 mL of water contained in an open 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The resulting two-phase mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2 hr. The flask is then connected to a rotary evaporator and methanol is removed at 20-30°C (18 mm). The two-phase residue is extracted with four 20-mL portions of diethyl ether and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate . Solvent is removed by rotary evaporation at water aspirator pressure and the resulting oil is distilled at reduced pressure, bp 94-96°C at 18 mm, to give 11.9-12.4 g (89-92%) of pure product as a colorless oil.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser is placed 970 g. (1200 cc., 13.1 moles) of n-butyl alcohol. This is warmed, and 180 g. (3 moles) of urea is added to the warm liquid in small portions, with shaking. While the temperature rises, care must be taken that the urea goes into solution without melting and does not form a layer of molten urea beneath the solution. The last portions of the urea are finally dissolved by boiling the liquid. The solution is then refluxed for thirty hours, during which time ammonia escapes from the top of the condenser. The reflux condenser is then removed and the liquid is distilled through an efficient column until the temperature of the liquid reaches 150°. The distillate consists of butyl alcohol containing ammonia and may be used directly in another run. The material which remains in the flask solidifies on cooling. It is boiled with 1 l. of ligroin (b.p. 60–90°), filtered, and the undissolved solid again boiled with two 100-cc. portions of ligroin, filtered, and finally washed on the filter with 100 cc. more of warm ligroin. The white gritty material which remains undissolved is practically pure cyanuric acid. The yield of cyanuric acid is 12–18 g. (9–14 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 2-l. beaker surrounded by an ice-salt bath, and fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, are placed 420 g. (392 ml., 5 moles) of thiophene and 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. A rapid stream of hydrogen chloride is passed continuously into the mixture with vigorous stirring. When the temperature reaches 0°, 500 ml. of 37% formaldehyde solution is added at a rate that will permit the temperature to remain below 5°. The addition requires about 4 hours. When all the formaldehyde solution has been added, the mixture is extracted with three 500-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed successively with water and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and then dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. The solvent is removed by distillation, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure through a 50-cm. fractionating column. The product boiling at 73–75°/17 mm. is collected. The yield is 257–267 g. (40–41%) of a colorless oily liquid and.
The solution is cooled and diluted with 1 l. of water, and the ester layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined ester and benzene extracts are washed with two 25-ml. portions of water and then distilled from a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask. The fraction (above 75 g.) which is collected at 95–118°/10 mm. is shaken mechanically for 4 hours with 100 ml. of 20% sodium bisulfite solution. The ester layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with three 25-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined ester and benzene extracts are washed with 25 ml. of water. The product remaining after removal of the benzene is distilled under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask or through a Widmer column. The yield of ester boiling at 112–113°/8 mm. is 63.5–68 g. (81–87%).
If an especially pure product is desired, the acid may be reprecipitated by dissolving in an equal weight of warm water and adding three volumes of methyl alcohol. The loss in purification is 4–5 per cent.
The product is purified by flash chromatography,(Note 14),(Note 15). A flash column of 7-cm diameter is charged with 450 g of silica gel (Kieselgel 60, Merck, Korngrösse 0.040–0.063 mm, 230–400 mesh ASTM) and 10.4 g of the crude product. A 1 : 1 mixture of ether and pentane is used for elution, with a running rate of 5-cm column length per minute (pressure 1.25 atm). After a 200-mL forerun, 33-mL fractions are collected. No attempt is made to separate the two diastereoisomers; fractions 22–40 are combined to give 8.0 g (70%) of pure allylated product [ratio of diastereoisomers 92 : 8], after removal of the solvent; [α]D20 + 11.2° (chloroform, c 2.23).
B. (R)-(+)-2-Methyl-2-(3-oxobutyl)cyclohexanone (2). The solution of imines 1 is cooled in an ice bath and 72.5 mL (61.0 g, 0.870 mol, ca. 1.05 equiv) of freshly distilled methyl vinyl ketone is added with a syringe, with magnetic stirring, under a nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is then heated at ca. 40°C for 24 hr.
A. Neopentyl iodide. A 500-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser equipped with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 136 g. (115 ml., 0.439 mole) of triphenyl phosphite, 35.2 g. (0.400 mole) of neopentyl alcohol, and 85 g. (37 ml., 0.60 mole) of methyl iodide. A thermometer of sufficient length extends into the liquid contents of the flask. The mixture is heated under gentle reflux with an electric heating mantle until the temperature of the refluxing liquid rises from its initial value of 75–80° to about 130°, and the mixture darkens and begins to fume. The time required is about 24 hours. It is necessary to adjust the heat input from the mantle from time to time as the reaction proceeds and the reflux rate diminishes.
The reaction flask is now surrounded with ice water and cooled to 10°, with stirring. The product is then collected on a large Büchner funnel, and washed with cold water to remove the bromine liquor. The filtrate may be discarded, as it contains only impurities. The material is dried overnight at room temperature and need not be recrystallized; the yield is 343–400 g. (72–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 2,2'-Sebacoyldicyclohexanone. A solution of 167 g. (1.00 mole) of 1-morpholino-1-cyclohexene2 and 101 g. (139 ml., 1.00 mole) of anhydrous triethylamine in 500 ml. of dry chloroform is put in a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser. Tubes of calcium chloride are inserted in the open ends of the dropping funnel and reflux condenser. The reaction flask is immersed in a water bath at 35°, and a solution of 120 g. (0.50 mole) of sebacoyl chloride in 200 ml. of dry chloroform is added to the well-stirred reaction mixture over a period of about 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture gradually assumes an orange to red color, and a solid precipitates. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 3 hours at 35°, 500 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is boiled under reflux for 5 hours with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the chloroform layer is separated and extracted with six 150-ml. portions of water. The washings and the aqueous phase are combined, adjusted to a pH of 5–6 with 25% sodium hydroxide solution, and extracted with five 100-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined with the chloroform layer, and the chloroform is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue gradually congeals to an oily solid on standing at room temperature under a pressure of 10–50 mm. The yield of crude 2,2'-sebacoyldicyclohexanone is 181–192 g. (100–106%).
B. Dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylic acid. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an overhead stirrer and a 100-mL addition funnel. Disodium dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate (90.37 g 0.42 mol) in 100 mL of water and 100 g of crushed ice are added. The resulting slurry is cooled with an ice/sodium chloride bath and a solution of concentrated hydrochloric acid (84 mL of 36–38%) is added dropwise with stirring over 45 min. The reaction mixture is washed five times with 200 mL of dry ether and the ether layer is decanted. The product is immediately collected by filtration using a Büchner funnel. Drying the collected solid at room temperature under reduced pressure affords 51.6–53.06 g (72–74%) of dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylic acid as a yellow powder: mp 144–148°C.
B. (−)-2,4-O-Ethylidene-D-erythrose . A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a thermometer and two 200-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnels, is charged with a suspension of sodium metaperiodate (59.2 g, 277 mmol, Note 11) in water (450 mL). The flask is cooled to 0°C using an ice-water bath. A solution of (−)-4,6-O-ethylidene-D-glucose (29.2 g, 142 mmol, Note 12) in water (120 mL) is added dropwise with stirring and under permanent control of the pH and temperature. The temperature in the flask should be kept below 10°C, and the pH is maintained at approximately 4 by dropwise addition of 8 N aqueous sodium hydroxide. After stirring for 3 hr at = 10°C, the pH is adjusted to 6.5 by addition of more 8 N sodium hydroxide and stirring is continued for another 2 hr at room temperature. The solution is evaporated under reduced pressure (50°C, 30 mm) and the residue dried at room temperature and 0.02 mm (oil vacuum). To the pale-yellow, solid crude product, ethyl acetate (80 mL) is added and the flask is heated for 2 min at 80°C with stirring. The suspension is filtered and the solid residue is treated three times with ethyl acetate (80 mL each) as described above. The combined, filtered extracts are dried over sodium sulfate for 1 hr with stirring and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30°C, 30 mm), followed by slow removal of solvent at 0.02 mm (oil vacuum) at room temperature to yield 20.1 g (97%) of (−)-2,4-O-ethylidene-D-erythrose as a colorless, amorphous solid, mp 120-121°C.
The reaction mixture is cooled in a water–ice bath, and a saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 35°C. Ammonium chloride solution is added in portions until addition produces no further exothermic reaction. The supernatant solution is decanted through glass wool onto 400 g of ice in a 4-L separatory funnel. The residual solids are washed with three portions of hexane, approximately 1000 mL total, and the washes are decanted into the separatory funnel. After the phases are separated, the aqueous phase is washed with an additional 500-mL portion of hexane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 500 mL of saturated ammonium chloride, and then with 500 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Most of the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator and the residual oil is distilled at reduced pressure using an ice–water-cooled fraction cutting head. After a small forerun, approximately 390–392 g (94% of theory) is collected as a colorless oil, bp 116°C at 1.6 mm (lit. 155°C at 17 mm).2
E. N-Benzylazetidine-2,3-dione . N-Benzyl-3-(Z/E)-ethylideneazetidin-2-one (5.0 g, 26.7 mmol) is dissolved in 150 mL of methanol and 100 mL of water contained in a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask. Sodium metaperiodate (14.3 g, 67.0 mmol) is introduced, followed by approximately 40 mg of osmium tetraoxide. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 12 hr under nitrogen, treated with Celite (6 g), and agitated for an additional hour prior to filtration. The filtrate is concentrated to 1/3 of its volume under reduced pressure, then extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic phases are washed once with brine, dried, and concentrated to leave a dark brown oil. This oil is flushed through a short pad of silica gel (8 cm × 8 cm) using dichloromethane as eluant (900 mL). The pure fractions are pooled and evaporated to give a clear pale yellow oil, which crystallizes on prolonged standing at 5°C. The yield of N-benzylazetidine-2,3-dione is 3.12-3.64 g (66.7-77.9%).
B. Tris(chloromethyl)acetic acid: 3-Chloro-2,2-bis(chloromethyl)propanoic acid . (Caution: Nitrogen oxides are highly toxic. This procedure should be carried out in a well-ventilated hood!) The crude mixture (461 g) of pentaerythrityl tetrachloride and pentaerythrityl trichlorohydrin obtained from the above reaction is transferred to a 3-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask that is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer adapter, and an addition funnel. The transfer is most easily accomplished by melting the solid over a steam bath and pouring the mixture through a funnel directly into the reaction flask. The flask and its contents are heated to 70-80°C with a heating mantle, and a small portion (10-15 mL) of concentrated nitric acid is added with vigorous stirring to initiate the reaction. As the reaction begins, a large amount of dark orange-brown vapors appears. Stirring is continued, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed after the initial exothermic reaction subsides (usually within 15 min). The remaining nitric acid (660-680 mL) is added in 20-30-mL aliquots over 30 to 60 min so that nitrogen oxides are continually evolved but the reaction does not become violent. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is carefully removed and left in the hood to air out and is replaced by a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is heated at 70-80°C until the evolution of nitrogen oxides is no longer evident. At this point, the biphasic reaction mixture is a cloudy yellow or white liquid. The warm reaction mixture is poured into a 4-L beaker and 2 L of cold water is added is to precipitate the tetrachloride/carboxylic acid product mixture. The beaker and its contents are allowed to stand for several hours at room temperature to ensure complete precipitation of the product; then the crude product mixture is filtered, washed with water, and the carboxylic acid is extracted as follows. The solid is pulverized, transferred to a 4-L beaker, and 2.5 L of 1 M sodium hydroxide is added with stirring. The liquid reaction mixture instantly becomes bright yellow, and the insoluble, white tetrachloride clumps on the sides of the beaker. Stirring is continued for 30-60 min whereupon the insoluble material is filtered and washed well with water. The combined washings and yellow, aqueous filtrate are acidified to pH 1 with concentrated hydrochloric acid (~250 mL). The carboxylic acid precipitates as a white solid that is easily filtered using two pieces of filter paper. The filtered and dried product thus obtained is a fine white powder (230 g, 65% yield). The aqueous filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride ; the extracts are dried with magnesium sulfate and concentrated to provide an additional 50-60 g of the desired acid. The crude, combined product (75% yield) can be used directly in the next step. Over several runs, the yield varies from 65-80%.
A. cis-3,5-Diacetoxycyclopentene. A flame-dried, 100-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a serum cap, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, and an 18-gauge needle attached to a dry source of argon vented through a mineral oil bubbler. The apparatus is flushed with argon and charged with 16.70 g (118 mmol) of (±)-cis-4-acetoxy-1-hydroxycyclopent-2-ene [(±)-1] and 20 mL of methylene chloride. To this stirred solution is added 8.81 g (129 mmol) of imidazole in one portion. When dissolution is complete, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C with the aid of an ice-water bath. Acetic anhydride (13.20 g, 12.20 mL, 129 mmol) is added dropwise over 5 min by means of an oven-dried syringe and needle. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to stir at ambient temperature until judged complete by TLC analysis. The contents of the flask are transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and diluted with 60 mL of reagent grade ethyl ether. The contents of the separatory funnel are washed with 60 mL of ice-cold 1 N hydrochloric acid which results in noticeable removal of all color from the organic phase. The acidic aqueous phase is back-extracted with two 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with a single 50-mL portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution followed by back-extraction of the aqueous phase with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under rotary evaporation at 30 mm. The resulting viscous tan oil is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to afford 20.9–21.1 g (96–98%) of cis-3,5-diacetoxycyclopentene (2) as a colorless liquid, bp 55–56°C at 0.1 mm.
B. 3-Chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran. A dry, 4-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a powerful mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a gas-inlet tube extending nearly to the bottom of the flask is charged with 51 g. (2.11 g.-atoms) of magnesium turnings and 1.2 l. of anhydrous ether. Methyl bromide (200 g., 2.15 moles) is allowed to distill into the continuously stirred reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing. The formation of an ethereal solution of methylmagnesium bromide requires approximately 2 hours. The gas-inlet tube is then replaced with a dry, 1-l. dropping funnel, protected with a calcium chloride drying tube. The reaction mixture is cooled with stirring in an ice–salt bath. The cold, ethereal 2,3-dichlorotetrahydropyran solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise, with continuous stirring and cooling, to the solution of methylmagnesium bromide at such a rate that the reaction solution does not reflux too vigorously. When this addition is complete, the resulting slurry is refluxed with stirring for 3 hours, then cooled in an ice bath. To the resulting cold (0°), vigorously stirred suspension is slowly added 900 ml. of cold 15% hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, then concentrated by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 12-cm. Vigreux column, separating 122–136 g. (65–72%) of a mixture of cis- and trans-3-chloro-2-methyltetrahydropyran as a colorless liquid, boiling over the range 48–95° (17–18 mm.), sufficiently pure for use in the next step.
The impure azide is dissolved in 110–120 ml. of 95% ethanol at 50–55°, and 2 g. of activated carbon is added to aid in the removal of impurities. After being filtered through a steam-heated funnel, the warm solution is allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon 14–15 g. of the product precipitates as light-yellow prisms, m.p. 53–55°. Concentration of the mother liquor to 30–40 ml. by evaporation at room temperature under an air stream causes the separation of an additional 7–8 g. of material, m.p. 52–54°. The total yield of purified o-nitrophenylazide is 63–69%.
An additional 40 ml. of benzene is added (to accomplish drying on distillation), and the product is distilled under reduced pressure, using a short still head with no fractionating column. The yield of ethyl benzoylacetate, b.p. 145–150°/12 mm., is 197–203 g. (68–71%).
Unless a specially purified product (see below) is desired, the crude material is heated for three hours on the steam bath with 400 cc. of alcohol and a solution of 25 g. of sodium hydroxide in 100 cc. of water. After cooling, the product is collected, washed, and crystallized from 500 cc. of alcohol. The yield is 75–80 g. (75–80 per cent of the theoretical amount), and a well-dried sample melts at 140–141°.
A. 1,5-Hexadien-3-ol. In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stirrer, a dropping funnel and an ice-water condenser are placed 153.0 g. (6.28 g. atoms) of magnesium turnings, 360 ml. of anhydrous ether, and a few crystals of iodine. A solution of 351.0 g. (2.90 moles) of allyl bromide in 2.6 l. of ether is added in small portions until the reaction begins, and then at such a rate as to maintain gentle refluxing of the ether. The addition requires about 3 hours, after which the reaction mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for an additional hour. Acrolein (104.0 g., 1.86 moles) is added during 2 hours, and this causes gentle refluxing. After an additional hour at room temperature the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 2 l. of ice water. The precipitate is dissolved by adding slowly a solution of 120 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 400 ml. of water. The organic layer is separated and the water layer extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined oil and ether extracts are dried over 8–10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the ether, the residue is distilled through a 6-in. column packed with glass helices to yield 104–108 g. (57–59%, based on acrolein) of 1,5-hexadien-3-ol; b.p. 62–65/50 mm., nD25 1.4440.
A. 1,4-Dioxaspiro[4.5]decane. A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is charged with 118 g. (1.20 moles) of cyclohexanone, 82 g. (1.32 moles) of 1,2-ethanediol, 250 ml. of reagent grade benzene, and 0.05 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The flask is attached to a water separator2 under a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube. A heating mantle is placed under the flask, and the reaction mixture is refluxed until close to the theoretical amount of water (21.6 ml.) has collected in the trap; this requires about 6 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, extracted successively with 200 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution and five 100-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. 1,4-Dioxaspiro[4.5]decane is obtained as a colorless liquid, b.p. 65–67° (13 mm.), weight 128–145 g. (75–85%), n25D 1.4565–1.4575.
The flask is now fitted with a condenser, and as much alcohol as possible is distilled off on the steam bath. The residual liquid is cooled, filtered if necessary, and the layer of benzyl cyanide separated. This crude benzyl cyanide is now placed in a Claisen distilling flask and distilled under reduced pressure, the water and alcohol coming over first, and finally the cyanide. It is advantageous to use a fractionating column or, better still, a Claisen flask with a modified side arm1 (p. 130), which gives the same effect as a fractionating column. The material is collected at 135–140° /38 mm. (115–120° /10 mm.). The yield is 740–830 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The combined dichloromethane solutions may be washed with dilute hydrochloric acid, sodium hydrogen carbonate solution, and water, or filtered directly through a filter aid, or passed through a chromatographic column to remove traces of pyridine and chromium salts. The product is obtained by removal of dichloromethane; any pyridine that remains can often be removed under reduced pressure.
The residue is then transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and separatory funnel. The mixture is treated with stirring with a solution of 186 g. of technical sodium hydroxide or 170 g. (4.25 moles) of c.p. sodium hydroxide in about 300 cc. of water. With continuous stirring 235 g. (1.67 moles) of benzoyl chloride is now added during the course of one hour, keeping the temperature down by cooling with running water. After the addition, the reaction mixture is cooled, the amide separated, washed with a little water and distilled under reduced pressure. The product boils at 180–184° /20 mm., 191–194° /27 mm., 240–244° /130 mm., and weighs 240–250 g. (77–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a separate, dry, 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted to a nitrogen bubbler and equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a septum inlet is added a solution of 12.6 g (60.0 mmol) of 2-(hydroxymethylene)cyclododecanone in 500 mL of anhydrous ether. The stirred ethereal solution of the hydroxymethylene ketone is treated at 22°C with 33 mL of a freshly prepared mixture (1/1, v/v) of chlorotrimethylsilane and triethylamine. An immediate reaction takes place with deposition of a white precipitate. The mixture is stirred thoroughly at 22°C for 15 min to insure complete conversion to the silyl enol ether.
2-Hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, Method 2. A mixture of 50 g. (1 mole) of 48% sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil, 2 l. of dry ether, and 5 ml. of ethyl alcohol is placed in a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, dropping funnel, and vent tube. The reaction vessel is cooled by means of a cold water bath, and a solution of 98 g. (103 ml., 1 mole) of redistilled cyclohexanone and 110 g. (120 ml., 1.5 moles) of ethyl formate is added dropwise during 1 hour. Stirring is continued for 6 hours, and the solution is allowed to stand overnight. After the addition of 20 ml. of ethyl alcohol, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour. Water (200 ml.) is added to the flask with stirring, the mixture is shaken in a 3-l. separatory funnel and the organic layer separated. The product is isolated according to the procedure described in Method 1. The yield of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone is the same by both methods.
The pentane extract is dried over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. After removal of the drying agent by filtration, the pentane is slowly removed from the product by distillation through a 20-cm. Hempel column packed with glass helices. When the pentane is removed, a white crystalline residue remains which weighs 78–83 g. (88–94% yield based on the hydrogenated Diels-Alder adduct). This 2,3-diazabicyclo [2.2.1]hept-2-ene melts at 98.0–99.5°.
4-Dodecylbenzenesulfonyl chlorides. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical overhead stirrer, a Claisen adapter bearing an immersion thermometer, a pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and reflux condenser, is charged with a solution of 60.00 g (0.184 mol) of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acids and 8.64 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF) in 60 mL of hexane . Stirring is initiated while the mixture is heated to 70°C using a heating mantle, and 22.1 mL (36.24 g, 0.304 mol) of thionyl chloride is added at a rate to maintain controlled reflux. The required addition time is about 1 hr. The dark solution is heated an additional 2 hr at 70°C and cooled to 40°C. While still warm (~40°C), the mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel, and the dark lower layer is separated from the hexane solution. The hexane layer is cooled to 25°C and washed with 60 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The bicarbonate wash is back extracted with 36 mL of hexane and the combined hexane layers are treated with 3 g of carbon, and stirred for 2 hr at 25°C. The carbon is removed by filtration and the cake is washed with three portions (12-mL each) of hexane. The combined hexane layers plus the hexane washes are used to prepare the azide.
A 250-cc. separatory funnel is fixed so that its stem extends below the surface of the pasty suspension. A solution of 46 g. (0.67 mole) of sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is placed in the funnel and is slowly added to the well-stirred mixture until it shows a positive starch-iodide test for nitrous acid. The temperature of the mixture is maintained between 0° and +5° throughout the addition of the nitrite solution, which requires about ninety minutes. Usually, all but 5–8 cc. of the nitrite solution must be added before a positive test for nitrous acid appears.
A solution of methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate (1) (9.1 g, 54.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) in CH3CN (20 mL), prepared in a flame-dried 50-mL round-bottomed flask, is added to the DIB solution over 3 h via syringe pump. During the addition, the tip of the needle is immersed into the solution to a depth of 0.5 inch and the progress of the reaction is followed by TLC. At the end of the addition, the solution turns light brown. The mixture is transferred to a one-necked 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated under reduced pressure (mechanical pump vacuum, 175 mmHg) at 32 °C (rotary evaporator bath temperature). Toluene (10 mL) is then added and the resulting suspension is concentrated under reduced pressure to azeotropically remove residual TFA. Addition of toluene and evaporation are repeated twice again to ensure removal of essentially all of the TFA.
A mixture of 107 g. (1 mole) of methylaniline, 145 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 400 g. of ice is placed in a 3-l. flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred vigorously, and the temperature is maintained at 10° or below by the addition of more ice as required, while a solution of 70 g. (1 mole) of sodium nitrite in 250 cc. of water is added during the course of five or ten minutes. Stirring is then continued for one hour more. The oily layer is separated, and the aqueous portion is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of benzene. The benzene is removed by distillation at ordinary pressure, and the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure. The main fraction of the nitrosomethylaniline distils as a light yellow liquid boiling at 135–137°/13 mm. The yield is 118–127 g. (87–93 per cent of the theoretical amount).
1-Carbethoxy-4-piperidone (7.52 g, 43.9 mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (5.0 g, 26 mmol) are added to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask that contains the above distillate and a magnetic stir bar. The mixture is stirred under vacuum (20 mm) at 100°C for 90 min and the evolved water vapor is collected in a vacuum trap. The mixture is cooled to 23°C and subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel (250 g, 20 cm × 10 cm) using ethyl acetate:hexane (1:4) as the eluant to give 9.0 g (59% overall) of (2R,3S)- and (2S,3S)-1,4-dioxa-2,3-dimethyl-2-(1-methylethenyl)-8-carboethoxy-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane, a 6:1 mixture of diastereomers, as a pale yellow oil.
In a 5-l. flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and cooled in an ice bath, are placed 2.7 l. of water and 350 cc. (644 g.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). When the temperature has fallen to 15°, 342 g. (403 cc., 3 moles) of heptaldehyde is added, followed by 340 g. (2.15 moles) of potassium permanganate in 15-g. portions. The permanganate is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20°. When the addition of the permanganate is complete, sulfur dioxide is passed through the solution until it becomes clear. The oily layer is separated, washed once with water, and distilled from a modified Claisen flask having a 30-cm. fractionating side arm. The fore-runs are separated from any water and distilled again; this is followed by a redistillation of the high-boiling fractions. The yield of material boiling at 159–161°/100 mm. is 296–305 g. (76–78 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product is sufficiently pure for many purposes; titration indicates a purity of 95–97 per cent.
A. (1R,2r,3S)-2-Nitrocyclohexane-1,3-diol. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, and an ice–ethanol bath is charged with 175 mL (0.455 mol) of an aqueous 25% solution of glutaric dialdehyde, 38 mL (0.708 mol) of nitromethane, and 600 mL of methanol. At 0–5°C 12 mL of aqueous 2 M sodium hydroxide is added gradually. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred for 4 hr at room temperature. The resulting yellow solution is neutralized by adding 15 g of acidic cation-exchange resin and stirring for an additional 20 min. The resin is filtered off and washed with a small volume of methanol. The filtrate is evaporated to a semisolid residue using reduced pressure and a 35°C water bath. The residue is dissolved in 100 mL of absolute ethyl alcohol with heating and diluted by gradual addition of 250 mL of toluene. The resulting two-phase mixture is again evaporated, with azeotropic removal of water. The resulting residue is again taken up in 100 mL of hot ethyl alcohol and diluted with 250 mL of toluene. The almost colorless crystals are filtered and dried at high vacuum to yield 44–52 g (60–70%) of nitrodiol, mp 152–155°C (dec).
After drying on paper the purplish solid is dried to constant weight in three 20-cm. evaporating dishes at 90–100° (about two days) and is then repowdered. The product is light purplish-gray and weighs 1270–1325 g. (80–84 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 157–160°. The product is pure enough for use in the preparation of p-dimethylaminobenzophenone (p. 217) and for most synthetic purposes. When 100 g. of benzanilide is dissolved in 750 cc. of hot alcohol and the solution is boiled with about 10 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite), filtered, and cooled at 10° overnight, 80–86 g. of an almost colorless product melting at 160–161° separates. A second crystallization from alcohol using decolorizing carbon gives a white product with approximately the same loss in the mother liquors as in the first crystallization.
When cool, the reaction mixture is poured slowly with stirring into 1 l. of ice and water. If the stirring is thorough, most of the triphenylstibine is to be found in the ether layer. The hydrolysis mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel and the residue on the filter extracted three times with 100-cc. portions of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted twice with 200-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether portions are evaporated slowly on a steam bath to remove the ether, and there remains behind a yellow semi-solid which crystallizes to a white solid on cooling. The yield of crude product melting at 49° is 145–160 g. (82–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). For purification from a small amount of biphenyl which is present in the crude product, 90 g. of triphenylstibine is dissolved in 200 cc. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–50°) by warming on a steam bath. There is generally a small amount of insoluble residue which is filtered and the filtrate cooled in a freezing mixture. The triphenylstibine separates as small prisms and weighs 58–65 g.; by further concentration of the filtrate to an approximate volume of 50 cc. and then cooling again, an additional 15–20 g. of product separates. Both portions melt at 50°.
The reaction mixture is poured into an ice-cold aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution (700 mL). The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 500 mL). The organic phases are combined, washed with brine (500 mL), and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, crude 2 (115 g) is obtained as a white solid.
C. Dimethyl dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate. Absolute methanol (700 mL,) is placed in a dry, 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, thermometer, and a 100-mL addition funnel and is cooled to −30°C. Thionyl chloride (62.12 g, 0.522 mol, 38.1 mL,) is added carefully with stirring and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at −30°C for 30 min. Dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylic acid (45.00 g, 0.261 mol) is added as a solid in portions over 30 min to the cooled, stirred thionyl chloride-methanol solution. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (1 hr) and is subsequently warmed to 35–40°C (internal temperature) for 2 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to −30°C and the precipitate is collected by filtration using a Büchner funnel. The collected solid is washed with ether (115 mL,) and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to give an orange-brown oil (ca. 15 g). The collected solid is triturated with methylene chloride (2.0 L) and the insoluble inorganic salts are removed by filtration using a Büchner funnel. The orange-brown oil (ca. 15 g) is taken up in water (150 mL) and extracted with methylene chloride (6 × 270 ml). The combined methylene chloride extracts and methylene chloride triturate are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 23–31 g (44–51%) of pure dimethyl dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate as an orange-yellow powder: mp 171–172°C.
In a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient stirrer, separatory funnel, and reflux condenser is placed a mixture of 235 g. (2.5 moles) of phenol and 100 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1 l. of water. The mixture is cooled, with stirring, in an ice-salt bath to below 10°. There is then added through the separatory funnel, with stirring, 315 g. (235 cc., 2.5 moles) of dimethyl sulfate. This addition requires about one hour, and the cooling bath is not removed until the addition is complete. The mixture is then heated on a water bath for one-half hour. At the end of this time there is added through the separatory funnel a mixture of 235 g. (2.5 moles) of phenol and 100 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1 l. of water. This addition requires about fifteen minutes. The mixture is then refluxed vigorously over a free flame for fifteen hours.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a 1-l. dropping funnel, and a thermometer, is placed a solution of 120 g. (1.2 moles) of pure chromium trioxide in 150 ml. of 80% aqueous acetic acid. The flask is surrounded by a freezing mixture of ice and salt, and, when the temperature of the contents of the flask has fallen to 0°, a solution of 64 g. (0.5 mole) of naphthalene in 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid is gradually added, with constant stirring, over a period of 2–3 hours. The internal temperature is maintained at about 10–15°. Stirring is continued overnight, during which time the reaction mixture and cooling bath gradually attain room temperature. The dark green solution is then set aside for 3 days and occasionally stirred.
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, an addition funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, and nitrogen inlet is charged with diphenyl disulfide (200 g, 917 mmol) and dichloromethane (320 mL). The addition funnel is charged with bromine (161 g, 52 mL, 1.01 mol). After the diphenyl disulfide dissolves, the nitrogen inlet is replaced with a calcium sulfate-packed drying tube, and the flask is fitted with a gas-dispersion tube. Ethylene (73.1 g, 2.61 mol), is slowly bubbled into the solution through a gas dispersion tube, and the bromine is added in 2–3-mL portions over 5 hr,. After addition of the bromine and ethylene is complete, the drying tube is replaced with the nitrogen inlet, and the flask is fitted with a clean addition funnel. The addition funnel is charged with 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU, (306 g, 300 mL, 2.01 mol). DBU is added at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 55°C. After the DBU is added the reaction mixture is maintained at about 50°C for 15–18 hr. A 1.0 M ammonium hydroxide solution (600 mL) is added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 300 mL of dichloromethane. The organic fractions are combined, washed with water (600 mL), and dried with 10 g of magnesium sulfate. The mixture is filtered, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residue affords 162–184 g (65–74%) of phenyl vinyl sulfide, bp 80–84°C/11–12 mm,, and. The purity is greater than 98% by GC analysis,.
C. (1S,2S)-2-Methyl-3-oxo-1-phenylpropylcarbamate (3). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, rubber septum and argon inlet is charged with N-Boc-imine 2 (5.00 g, 24.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The flask is flushed with dry argon and anhydrous acetonitrile (240 mL) is added via cannula under argon. Freshly distilled propionaldehyde (3.52 mL, 48.7 mmol, 2.0 equiv) is added quickly in one portion by syringe and the flask is sealed and purged with argon. The resulting colorless solution is cooled to 0 °C (internal temperature) with a cryostat. The septum is removed temporarily and (S)-proline (561 mg, 4.87 mmol, 20 mol %) is added. After the reaction mixture is stirred at 0 °C (internal temperature) for 12 h, it is treated with 80 mL of distilled water and warmed to 25 °C. The solution is stirred vigorously for 20 min at 25 °C, diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL), and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (100 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (60 mL), dried over MgSO4 (20 g), filtered through a Büchner funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporator (30 °C, water bath temp, 20 mmHg). The resulting solid is triturated with cool iso-hexane (4 °C, 70 mL), filtered, washed with an additional portion of cool iso-hexane (4 °C, 15 mL), and dried under vacuum (0.5 mmHg, 25 °C) to afford 5.61 g (87%) of Mannich product 3.
In order to remove 1–3 g. of contaminating 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid, the crude acid is ground in a mortar and refluxed briefly with 100 ml. of chloroform, and the suspension is filtered hot. The separated solid is dried in air and added to 1 l. of boiling water. The mixture is boiled gently for 15 minutes and filtered by gravity to remove a small amount of gray sludge. The clear light-orange filtrate rapidly deposits needles of 2-hydroxyisophthalic acid monohydrate. After cooling to 0–5°, the acid is collected and dried at 110°/50–150 mm. for 20 hours. The anhydrous acid, which ranges in color from pale pink to tan, weighs 22–29 g. (46–61%) and melts at 243–255°, depending on the rate of heating and the apparatus used.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 12 g. (0.5 gram atom) of magnesium powder, 37 g. (0.5 mole) of tert-butyl alcohol, and 100 g. of anhydrous ether. The flask is fitted with an addition tube, one arm of which bears a reflux condenser and the other arm a dropping funnel. While the mixture is being shaken by hand, a solution of 55 g. (0.7 mole) of acetyl chloride in 50 g. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise. A lively reaction gradually ensues with evolution of hydrogen, mixed with ether vapor and a little hydrogen chloride. After all the acetyl chloride has been added, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand in a pan of cold water for 1 hour. After another hour at room temperature the mixture is warmed in a water bath at 40–45° for 30 minutes in order to complete the reaction.
The flask A is heated by means of an oil bath maintained at 120–125°; the mixed vapors of alcohol and water, passing through the fractionating column, are condensed in D, and the moist alcohol is delivered under the surface of the alcohol contained in flask B. In flask B are placed 250 cc. of absolute alcohol and about 200 g. of freshly ignited potassium carbonate. Flask B is heated in an oil bath maintained at about 95–100°. The moist alcohol delivered to the flask B is dried by the potassium carbonate and subsequently returned as vapor under the surface of the liquid in flask A. The tube C, which is provided with a calcium chloride tube and is open to the air, acts as a vent for the otherwise closed system. The reaction is run for about five hours. The excess alcohol is then distilled, the residue of ethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 98–101°/21 mm. is collected. The yield is 234–264 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 4-Nitro-3-hexanol (1).2 To a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and drying tube are added propionaldehyde (174 g, 3 mol) and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (450 mL). The solution is stirred while finely ground potassium fluoride (25 g, 0.15 mol) is added to the flask. 1-Nitropropane (267.3 g, 3 mol) is then added dropwise with stirring, and the temperature is kept below 40°C with the aid of an ice bath. The ice bath is removed about 30 min after the addition of 1-nitropropane is complete. The flask contents are stirred for an additional 18 hr. The catalyst is then removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is poured into water (500 mL) and the oil is extracted with ether (3 × 300 mL). The ethereal layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The remaining liquid is distilled under reduced pressure and the fraction boiling at 88–90°C/2 mm is collected in a tared, 1-L round-bottomed flask, yielding 3-nitro-4-hexanol (330 g, 2.24 mol, 65%). The flask containing the product is used directly in the next step.
To 40 g. of dry chitin in a 500-ml. beaker is added 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (C.P., sp. gr. 1.18), and the mixture is heated on a boiling water bath for 2.5 hours with continuous mechanical agitation. At the end of this time solution is complete, and 200 ml. of water and 4 g. of Norit are added. The beaker is transferred to a hot plate, and the solution is maintained at a temperature of about 60° and is stirred continuously during the process of decolorization. After an hour the solution is filtered through a layer of a filter aid such as Filter-Cel. The filtrate is usually a pale straw color; however, if an excessive color persists, the decolorization may be repeated until the solution becomes almost colorless. The filtrate is concentrated under diminished pressure at 50° until the volume of the solution is 10–15 ml. The white crystals of glucosamine hydrochloride are washed onto a sintered-glass filter with 95% ethanol. The white crystalline product, after being washed with 95% ethanol and dried, weighs 24–28 g. (60–70% of the weight of the chitin used). The optical rotation of a stable solution of the product containing the α- and β-isomers at equilibrium, [α]25.5D, varies from +68.8° to +70.1° (c = 4.75 in water).
Caution! Since hydrogen is liberated in the first step of this reaction, it should be conducted in a hood. A dry 2-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a Trubore mechanical stirrer, an Allihn condenser, and a 1-l. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, the top of which is fitted with a gas inlet tube. After 40.0 g. (1.64 g. atoms) of clean, dry magnesium ribbon has been placed in the flask, the system is flushed with nitrogen and 600 ml. of anhydrous methanol is added. As soon as the vigorous reaction begins, the nitrogen flow is stopped; if necessary, the reaction may be moderated by external cooling with wet towels. When the hydrogen evolution has ceased, a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the reaction system and the condenser is replaced by a total condensation-partial take-off distillation head. The nitrogen flow is stopped, and the bulk of the methanol is distilled from the solution under reduced pressure with stirring while the reaction flask is heated to 50–55° with a water bath. This distillation is stopped when stirring of the pasty suspension of magnesium methoxide is no longer practical. Nitrogen is readmitted to the system, and the outlet from the distillation head is attached to a small trap containing mineral oil so that the volume of gas escaping from the reaction system can be estimated. Anhydrous dimethylformamide (700 ml.;) is added to the reaction flask, and the resulting suspension is stirred vigorously while a stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide is passed into the reaction vessel through the gas inlet tube attached to the dropping funnel. The dissolution of the carbon dioxide is accompanied by an exothermic reaction with the suspended magnesium methoxide to form a solution. When the absorption of carbon dioxide has stopped, the colorless solution is heated with a mantle under a slow stream of anhydrous carbon dioxide gas until the temperature of the liquid distilling from the flask reaches 140°, indicating that the residual methanol has been removed from the reaction mixture. The flow of carbon dioxide is stopped, and a slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the system while the resulting solution is cooled below 100° with a water bath. Cyclohexanone (20.0 g., 0.204 mole) is added to the reaction mixture, and the solution is heated under reflux for 2 hours while a slow stream of nitrogen (2–3 bubbles per second) is passed over the reaction mixture. The resulting solution is cooled first to room temperature with a water bath and then to −5° with a dry ice-acetone bath.
In a 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a sealed mechanical stirrer are placed 54.0 g. (1.00 mole) of commercial, anhydrous sodium methoxide and 2 l. of anhydrous ether. The flask is purged with dry nitrogen and cooled in an ice bath. The inlet tube is replaced by an addition funnel containing a solution of 123 g. (1.10 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexanone and 81.4 g. (1.10 moles) of ethyl formate. The solution is added rapidly, dropwise, and at the end of the addition the funnel is replaced by the nitrogen-inlet tube. After 15 minutes the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 12 hours at room temperature. The thick suspension is filtered by suction, and the filter cake is washed with anhydrous ether, care being taken to protect the product from atmospheric moisture. The solid salt is dried in a vacuum oven at ca. 70°, powdered, and stored in a tightly capped bottle. Sodio-2-formyl-6-methylcyclohexanone, a cream-colored powder, is obtained in 80–85% (130–138 g.) yield.
B. Diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate (3). A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an efficient reflux condenser (ca. 80 cm long) is charged with 51.2 g (0.21 mol) of dry N-bromophthalimide (2) and 43.1 g (0.26 mol) of freshly distilled triethyl phosphite. The mixture is immersed in an oil bath and the temperature of the oil bath gradually increased over about 15 min to 85–100°C, whereupon the solid dissolves and a vigorous, exothermic reaction ensues. When the reaction has subsided, the oil bath is lowered and the condenser is removed. The flask is fitted for simple distillation, and ethyl bromide and other volatile materials are distilled from the reaction mixture over a period of 3–4 hr by continued heating at 115°C (oil bath). The resulting light-yellow oil is cooled to room temperature, whereupon it solidifies. The crude product is collected by suction filtration and washed with three 100-mL portions of cold petroleum ether (bp 60–68°C) to give 50.1–56.3 g (80–90%) of diethyl phthalimidomethylphosphonate as white crystals, mp 60–63°C, which are used in the next step without further purification. Recrystallization of this material from diethyl ether/petroleum ether (bp 60–68°C) affords pure 3, mp 65–67°C (lit.,3 67°C).
The residue is cooled and dissolved in 171 ml. of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4), and the solution is warmed for 30 minutes on the steam bath. It is immediately concentrated to complete dryness under reduced pressure. The flask is cooled, 300 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is refluxed for a short time to render the cake friable. The benzene is removed by decantation, and the cake is pulverized and extracted six times by refluxing it briefly with 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined benzene and ether extracts are filtered and concentrated to a volume of about 225 ml. In the mean-time the residual salts are extracted twice by refluxing them vigorously for a short time with 300-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene solutions are separated by decantation and added to the ether concentrate. The distillation is then continued until about two-thirds of the benzene has been removed, when the benzene solution is poured into a beaker and allowed to cool. The methylsuccinic acid is collected on a filter and is washed by shaking a suspension of it in 150 ml. of chloroform. The yield of air-dried product, melting at 110–111°, amounts to 87–93 g. (66–70%).
Concentrated hydrochloric acid (500 ml.) is added to the semisolid reaction mixture, a reflux condenser is placed on the flask, and the mixture is heated under vigorous reflux for a period of 4 hours. An additional 500 ml. of hydrochloric acid is added, and the boiling under reflux is continued for an additional 4 hours.
A mixture of 120 g. (3.1 moles) of sodamide and 200 cc. of purified mineral oil is ground together in a mortar until the amide is finely pulverized. This suspension is transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser holding a calcium chloride tube, a 500-cc. separatory funnel, and an efficient mechanical stirrer through a mercury seal. The mortar and pestle are rinsed with an additional 250 cc. of the oil which is then added to the reaction flask. This is heated in an oil bath maintained at 160–165°, the stirrer is started, and 203 g. (1 mole) of cyclohexylbromopropene (p. 186) is dropped in during one and one-half hours. Ammonia is evolved, and this is allowed to pass through the condenser and is collected in water.
A previously prepared and heated solution of 50 g. of sodium carbonate in 1 l. of water is added, and steam is passed in to provide heat and agitation. With a rapid stream, the acid will go into solution in about ten minutes, leaving a small amount of brown, tarry material and a little alumina undissolved. The solution is filtered while hot and transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and the acid precipitated by the addition of 65 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The acid separates as an oil, which soon crystallizes. The solution is cooled in ice and the acid filtered and washed.
The crude product melts fairly sharply, but it is colored light green. The color may be almost completely removed by recrystallization from hot alcohol. The best result is obtained by dissolving 100 g. of the crude product in 600 cc. of boiling alcohol, heating with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite), filtering, and cooling the solution in an ice-salt bath. The crystals are then separated from the mother liquor by centrifuging. The yield of almost colorless crystals melting at 89.5–90.5° is 80 g.
A. Cuprous n-butylmercaptide. A mixture of 42.9 g. (0.30 mole) of freshly prepared cuprous oxide, 61.3 g. (0.68 mole)of 1-butanethiol, and 750 ml. of 95% ethanol is heated under reflux with mechanical stirring until the orange or red color of the cuprous oxide is completely changed to the white color of the cuprous n-butylmercaptide. The product is collected by filtration, washed several times with 95% ethanol, and dried in a vacuum. The yield is 91.6 g., essentially quantitative.
The residual α-ethoxalyl ester is decarbonylated to cetylmalonic ester by heating at 160–170° under reduced pressure. A water aspirator is sufficient to facilitate removal of the carbon monoxide formed during the heating. The decarbonylation requires about 1–1.5 hours. The cetylmalonic ester which remains as a dark liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure.
The excess permanganate is destroyed by adding a few milliliters of an acidified solution of sodium sulfite. The reaction mixture is cooled and made strongly acidic by cautious addition (foaming may occur) of 20% sulfuric acid. The mixture is heated, and the precipitated manganese dioxide is dissolved by stirring in powdered sodium sulfite (usually 70–80 g. is required). The resulting solution is cooled and extracted with one 200-ml., two 150-ml., and one 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the bulk of the ether removed by distillation from a steam bath. The residue is evaporated in a crystallizing dish. The crude acid (38–45 g.) is recrystallized from hot water. Considerable oiling may occur and 250–400 ml. of water is usually required to give complete solution. The yield of recrystallized acid is 28–32 g. (38–43%), m.p. 233–234°.
Fifty grams (0.28 mole) of purified anthracene is suspended in 320 ml. of anhydrous benzene and 120 ml. (1.68 moles) of reagent grade acetyl chloride contained in a 1-l. three-necked flask. The flask is fitted with a thermometer which is immersed in the suspension, a calcium chloride drying tube, an efficient motor-driven sealed stirrer, and a rubber addition tube to which a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 75 g. (0.56 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is attached.2
The solid is next digested on the steam bath for 30 minutes with 500 ml. of a 10% sodium carbonate solution, and is filtered and washed. The solid is then extracted for 30 minutes at 80° with 1 l. of 4% sodium bisulfite solution; at the end of this period 15 g. each of Filtercel and Norit are added, and the suspension is filtered. The extraction is repeated, and the combined filtrates are acidified at 80° with constant stirring, to Congo red paper, with concentrated hydrochloric acid (50–60 ml.). The temperature is maintained at 80° for 1 hour with constant stirring. The acenaphthenequinone separates as a bright yellow crystalline solid; it is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with water until free from acid. The yield is 45–70 g. (38–60%); m.p. 256–260°.
The solution is immediately separated from the insoluble material by filtration on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel, and the cake is sucked as dry as possible. The residue is transferred to the 3-l. beaker, triturated well with 1 l. of water, and then separated from the liquid by filtration. In the same manner, the residue is washed twice more with two 600-ml. portions of water. The filtrates are combined and placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. Two hundred grams of ammonium chloride is added, and the solution is mechanically stirred until solution is complete. The stirring is continued, and 220 g. (2.62 moles) of sodium bicarbonate is added during a period of about 10 minutes. The aminoguanidine bicarbonate begins to precipitate after a few minutes, and the solution is then placed in a refrigerator overnight. The precipitate is collected by filtration on a Büchner funnel. The cake is removed to a 1-l. beaker and mixed with a 400-ml. portion of a 5% solution of ammonium chloride and filtered. It is again washed with two 400-ml. portions of distilled water, the wash solution being removed each time by filtration. Finally the solid is pressed down on the Büchner funnel; the mat is broken up with a spatula and washed while on the funnel with two 400-ml. portions of 95% ethanol and then with one 400-ml. portion of ether. After air drying, the aminoguanidine bicarbonate amounts to 180–182 g. (63–64%) of a white solid, melting at 172° with decomposition and.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 61 g. (0.50 mole) of salicylaldehyde, 88 g. (0.55 mole) of ethyl malonate, and 200 ml. of absolute ethanol. To this mixture are added 5 ml. of piperidine and 0.5 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is heated under reflux for 3 hours. The hot solution is transferred to a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, the reaction flask is rinsed with 20 ml. of ethanol, and the ethanol rinse and 330 ml. of hot water are added to the solution. The product crystallizes readily as the solution cools; the mixture is stirred from time to time as crystallization proceeds and is finally stored overnight in a refrigerator. The crystalline product is collected by filtration and washed with a solution made from 80 ml. of 95% ethanol and 120 ml. of water. The material is dried in the air. The yield is 85–91 g. (78–83%) of product melting at 91–93°.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser is placed a solution of 1 g. of iodine in 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. One hundred grams (0.27 mole) of benzopinacol is added, and the flask is heated over a wire gauze, with shaking, until the solution boils gently. It is then refluxed for five minutes during which the solid benzopinacol disappears completely and a clear red solution is obtained. The solution is transferred at once to a 1-l. beaker, and, upon cooling, the benzopinacolone separates in fine threads. The product is filtered with suction, washed with two or three 60-cc. portions of cold glacial acetic acid until colorless, and dried. The filtrate is reserved for subsequent preparations. The yield of practically pure benzopinacolone melting at 178–179° is 90–91 g. (95–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a purer product is desired the material may be dissolved in 450 cc. of hot benzene, filtered, and treated with 250 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–100°). After cooling in ice the benzopinacolone is filtered and dried. The purified product weighs 82–83 g. and melts at 179–180°.
The dried product is then recrystallized from 30–35 ml. of a 1:3 mixture of boiling benzene and carbon tetrachloride. The yield of snow-white crystals is 15–15.7 g. (82–86%); the recrystallized product melts at 131–132° and is sufficiently pure for synthetic purposes. A second recrystallization gives a product which melts at 132–133° and.
To the solution of sodium cyanamide thus prepared, 380 g. (3.14 moles) of allyl bromide and 660 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol are added. The mixture is then heated on a water bath with good stirring until it refluxes gently, and the heating and stirring are continued for two and one-half hours. Then the reflux condenser is replaced by one set downward for distillation. The stirring is continued and the alcohol is distilled until about 500 cc. has been collected. The distillate may be discarded or used for the recovery of alcohol.
The contents of the flask are then filtered with suction through Filtercel and the residue, while kept in the Buchner funnel, is thoroughly washed with pentane until the washings are colorless. The pentane and much of the benzene are evaporated from the combined filtrates with a water aspirator.
A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen-inlet tube, and a 250-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel attached to a calcium chloride tube is charged with 16.96 g. (0.1000 mole) of 4-chloroacetophenone oxime and 500 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The flask is stoppered and cooled in an ice-water bath. In the dropping funnel is placed 140 ml. (0.22 mole) of 1.6 M n-butyllithium in hexane, which is rapidly added dropwise to the stirred solution over a 12–15-minute period. The solution is stirred for 30 minutes after the addition is complete, and the addition funnel is replaced by a clean one (125-ml. capacity), fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. Cooling is continued, a solution of 8.31 g. (0.0501 mole) of methyl anisate and in 100 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred mixture over a 6–10-minute period, and the resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes. At the end of this period, 300 ml. of 3 N hydrochloric acid is added. The nitrogen-inlet tube is removed and replaced by a reflux condenser, and the dropping funnel is replaced by a ground-glass stopper. The ice bath is removed, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. The flask is then cooled, and its contents are poured into a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and solid sodium hydrogen carbonate is added to the mixture until neutralization is complete.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stopper carrying a reflux condenser and a glass tube reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask are placed 350 g. (438 cc., 10.9 moles) of methyl alcohol and 900 g. of technical formalin containing 252 g. (8.4 moles) of formaldehyde.
The combined extract (about 1 l.) is flash-distilled at atmospheric pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask. After the solvent and a small amount of fore-run (ca. 15 g., b.p. 45°/3 mm.) have been removed, the product is distilled to yield 157–162 g. (92–95%), b.p. 150–162°/3 mm. (bath temperature, 180–190°), nD25 1.5053–1.5063,, and.
D. 3',5'-Di-O-benzoylthymidine . In a 500-mL photochemical reaction vessel, equipped with a magnetic stir bar, is placed 3',5'-di-O-benzoyl-2'-O-[(3-trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-5-methyluridine (3.82 g, 6.0 mmol), magnesium perchlorate hexahydrate (0.46 g, 1.4 mmol) and 9-ethyl-3,6-dimethylcarbazole (200 mg, 0.9 mmol ; for preparation see: Buck, J. P.; Park, M.; Wang, Z.; Prudhomme, D. R.; Rizzo, C. J. Org. Synth. 1999, 77, 153) in 500 mL of 9:1 2-propanol/water. The solution is degassed by bubbling argon through the solution for 1 hr using a syringe needle. The photochemical immersion well, equipped with a Pyrex filter is fitted into the reaction vessel and made air tight by lightly greasing the ground glass joints; an argon atmosphere is maintained. The reaction is cooled with an ice bath and photolyzed with a Hanovia 450W, medium pressure mercury lamp through a Pyrex filter for 1 hr. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L flask and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (150 mL), washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (2 × 30 mL), then brine (30 mL), and the organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil. Purification by flash column chromatography ( 150 g of silica gel) eluting with 50% ethyl acetate in hexanes gives 3',5'-di-O-benzoylthymidine (1.43 g, 53% yield), mp 195-196°C (lit.4 mp 194-195°C), and 5'-O-benzoyl-3'-deoxythymidine (0.32 g, 16% yield), mp 71-74°C (lit.5 mp 57-59°C), and recovered starting material (0.41 g, 11% yield).
To the residue which contains the crude hydroxy ester there is added 710 g. of pyridine (commercial reagent, C.P. grade), and the mixture is cooled to about 5° in an ice bath. To the cooled solution is added slowly with vigorous swirling 155 g. of phosphorus oxychloride (commercial reagent, C.P.); white crystals form almost immediately. The mixture is allowed to stand 8 hours at room temperature and is finally heated for 1.5 hours on the steam bath. It is then cooled to room temperature and decanted into a 5-l. separatory funnel containing 1.25 kg. of cracked ice. Crystals that remain in the flask are decomposed with an additional 125 g. of ice. The flask is rinsed with 1.5 l. of water, and then with 400 ml. of hexane. These washes are added to the material in the separatory funnel. After the two layers have been shaken together thoroughly and then separated, the aqueous phase is extracted with two additional 400-ml. portions of fresh hexane. The three hexane extracts are not combined, but are washed in turn with two 500-ml. portions of 2N hydrochloric acid to remove pyridine. Excess hydrochloric acid is removed by washing with three 200-ml. portions of water to pH 4. The clear amber-colored solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and solvent is removed by distillation as before. The residue, which weighs 120–135 g. and consists mainly of ethyl 4-ethyl-2-methyl-2-(and-3-)octenoates, is not distilled but is heated with sulfuric acid to convert the Δ3-isomer to γ-lactone,, and.
A solution of 218 g. (5.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1960 g. of water and 1000 g. (1225 cc.) of 95 per cent alcohol are introduced into a 5.5-l. bottle which is loosely covered with a perforated disk of cardboard, supplied with an effective stirrer, and supported in a larger vessel so as to permit cooling with cracked ice. Into the alkaline solution, 520 g. (4.3 moles) of pure acetophenone is poured, the bottle is rapidly surrounded with cracked ice, and the stirrer started; 460 g. (4.3 moles) of u. s. p. benzaldehyde is then added at once. The temperature of the mixture should not be below 15° and it should not be allowed to rise above 30° during the reaction. If it tends to do so, the stirring is not sufficiently vigorous.
A solution of 57.2 g (0.570 mol) of acetylacetone in 60 mL of dichloromethane is then added dropwise over 1 hr. An exothermic reaction occurs. At the end of the addition, the solution is allowed to warm very slowly to room temperature and stirred at that temperature for 17 hr.
B. (+)-Dirhodium(II) tetrakis[methyl 2-pyrrolidone-5(R)-carboxylate] acetonitrile-isopropanol solvate, (+)-Rh2 [(5R)-MEPY]4 (CH3CN)2 (i-PrOH). A 50-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and nitrogen inlet, is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 200 mg (0.452 mmol) of rhodium(II) acetate, 1.02 g (7.13 mmol) of methyl 2-pyrrolidone-5(R)-carboxylate, and 20 mL of chlorobenzene. The flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus into which is placed a thimble containing 5 g of an oven-dried mixture of 2 parts sodium carbonate and 1 part of sand. The initially green rhodium acetate, upon mixing with the pyrrolidonecarboxylate forms a blue solution, which is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 6 hr; removal of the solvent under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator yields a blue, glass-like solid. The solid is dissolved in a minimal volume of methanol and purified by chromatography on a column containing J.T. Baker BAKERBOND Cyano 40 μm prep LC pacKing (10 g) in methanol. The dirhodium(II) product forms a broad blue band across the top of the column, which moves imperceptively with methanol. However, the excess ligand moves rapidly as a yellow/brown band in methanol and may be collected with the first 100 mL of eluent. Subsequent elution with 1.0 vol % acetonitrile in methanol causes an instantaneous color change from blue to red and rapid elution. The entire red band is collected as one fraction, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure,. The resulting blue, glass-like solid (380 mg) is recrystallized by dissolving the solid in 1.0 mL of acetonitrile per 100 mg of solid and then adding an equivalent amount of isopropyl alcohol. Bright red crystals of Rh2 (5R-MEPY)4 (CH3CN)2 (i-PrOH) form overnight, and are collected by suction, washed with isopropyl alcohol and air-dried to yield 240 mg (0.262 mmol, 58% yield).
A 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed-mechanical stirrer, a Claisen adapter fitted with a thermometer and a gas-inlet adapter, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 150 ml. of acetylacetone and, 25 g. (0.12 mole) of 2-bromobenzoic acid, and 1.0 g. of copper(I) bromide. The mixture is thoroughly purged with dry nitrogen and stirred rapidly while 9.0 g. (0.47 mole) of an 80% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil is slowly added portionwise through the inlet protected by the calcium chloride drying tube. Addition of the first portions of the sodium hydride results in an immediate exothermic reaction, and the temperature of the mixture rises rapidly to 50–55°. The remainder of the sodium hydride is added at such a rate that the temperature remains within the 50–55° range; external cooling with a cold-water bath may be necessary. After addition of the sodium hydride is complete (30–35 minutes), the flask is placed in a hot-water bath heated to 80–85°, and the reaction mixture is stirred and heated for 5 hours, during which time a slow stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the apparatus.
When cold the aqueous layer is decanted (or filtered) from the solidified product, and the process of steam-agitation with acid is repeated, another 500 cc. of dilute acid being added. Finally the solid is filtered, washed with water, and dried in vacuo. The crude dinitrobenzaldehyde so obtained weighs 170–210 g. and melts at 40–50°. It is purified by heating in two lots each with 8 l. of naphtha (b.p. 90–110°) in a large flask on the steam bath with mechanical stirring for three hours, decanting the solution (temperature of liquid 80°) and allowing the aldehyde to crystallize. The purified dinitrobenzaldehyde, air-dried, weighs 79–104 g. (24–32 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 69–71°. From the mother liquors impure material may be recovered by evaporation or by distillation in steam, from which by a similar process of crystallization a further 20 g. of aldehyde of m.p. 66° can be separated.
A. 1,2:4,5-Di-O-isopropylidene-β-D-fructopyranose(1).2 D-Fructose (18.0 g, 100 mmol) and 2,2-dimethoxypropane (7.4 mL, 60 mmol) are added to 350 mL of acetone in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar. The flask is cooled in an ice bath for 15 min, then 4.3 mL of 70% perchloric acid is added in one portion. The resulting suspension is stirred for 6 hr at 0°C. Concentrated ammonium hydroxide (4.8 mL) is then added to neutralize the acid and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation at 25°C to give a white solid. This solid is dissolved in 200 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and washed with two 50-mL portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25°C) until the total volume is about 40 mL. Boiling hexane (100 mL) is then added and the flask is allowed to cool to room temperature, during which time the bulk of the product crystallizes out of solution. Additional product crystallizes upon cooling to −25°C for 4 hr. Isolation of the solid by vacuum filtration and careful washing with three 25-mL portions of cold (−25°C) hexane gives 13.4-13.6 g (51-52%) of the title alcohol as fine white needles.
In a 500-cc. flask are placed 50 g. (0.25 mole) of p-bromoacetophenone (p. 109) and 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid. To the resulting solution is very slowly added 40 g. (12.5 cc., 0.25 mole) of bromine, keeping the temperature below 20°. The mixture is vigorously shaken by hand during the addition. p-Bromophenacyl bromide begins to separate as needles when about one-half of the bromine has been added. The addition requires about thirty minutes.
2. Preparation of (R,R)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine To a mixture of the tartrate salt (9.1 g) in water (15 mL) at 0 °C are added KOH (20 g) pellets. The mixture is then stirred at 0 °C for 10 min before diethyl ether (80 mL) is added, whereupon the solution is stirred at 0 °C for another 30 min. The aqueous layer is then separated and extracted with diethyl ether (6 × 50 mL). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3) and then are concentrated under vacuum. The residue is transferred to a dry 25-mL, round-bottomed flask. To this is added a small piece of sodium and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 30 min. The residue is distilled under vacuum to give 3.61 g (83%) of (R,R)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear colorless oil (bp 97–98 °C at 8.0 mmHg). The enantiomeric purity of product is determined by CSP-SFC and CSP-HPLC analysis of the corresponding dibenzoyl amide derivative.
The fraction boiling at 23–35°/12 mm. is discarded, as it contains very little acetol. The main fraction distils at 35–47°/12 mm. and weighs 160 g. This material is refractionated, and the portion boiling at 40–43°/12 mm. is collected. The yield is 120–130 g. (54–58 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A mixture of 212 g. (1 mole) of benzoin, 110 g. (1.8 moles) of urea and 800 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask is heated under a reflux condenser for seven hours. The hot solution is quickly poured into a 2-l. beaker and allowed to stand at least three hours. The cold mixture is then transferred by means of a large wooden spoon or spatula to a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and sucked as dry as possible with the help of a rubber dam. The crystals are pressed down during the suction filtration. The filtrate is discarded. The crystals are returned to the beaker, stirred mechanically with 500 cc. of ether for thirty minutes, filtered again by suction, and spread out to dry at least overnight. The product is dissolved by heating with 1 l. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser, and the clear solution is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2.5 l. of water in a 4-l. (1-gal.) crock. Stirring is continued for thirty minutes. The mixture is filtered on a 30-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The crystals are transferred to the 2-l. beaker and stirred mechanically for ten minutes with 1 l. of water. After filtration, the washing with water is repeated. The product is then returned to the beaker, stirred with 750 cc. of ether, and filtered again. The material is then air-dried to constant weight. The yield of white fluffy crystals of diphenylglyoxalone melting at 330–335° (corr.) is 220–230 g. (93–97 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(B) Orthanilic Acid.—A 3-l. flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a liquid-sealed stirrer, is placed on a hot plate. In the flask is placed a mixture of 200 g. (0.90 mole) of o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl chloride, 100 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 600 cc. of water. The mixture is heated to boiling and stirred in order to promote the hydrolysis, which is complete within forty-five minutes after the compound has melted. The orange-red solution is filtered, and the filtrate is made just acid to litmus by the addition of acetic acid, about 25 cc. being required. The solution is transferred to a 3-l. three-necked flask which is provided with a reflux condenser and an efficient liquid-sealed stirrer. The solution is heated to boiling on the hot plate, and iron filings (about 20-mesh) are added, with vigorous stirring, at the rate of about 25 g. every fifteen minutes. A total of 350 g. of iron is used. In a few minutes the mixture becomes very deep brown in color and has a tendency to foam. After stirring for four hours, a sample when filtered should yield an almost colorless filtrate; if the filtrate is red or orange, stirring and heating must be continued. When a light-colored filtrate is obtained, 2 g. of decolorizing carbon is added, the hot mixture is filtered by suction, and the residue is washed several times with small amounts of hot water which are added to the main solution. The filtrate is chilled to about 15°, and 95 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is slowly added. The orthanilic acid separates in fine colorless crystals which appear as hexagonal plates under the microscope. When the temperature has again fallen to about 15°, the mass is filtered and the precipitate is washed with water and then with ethyl alcohol. If about 20 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate, an additional deposit of about 1 g. will be obtained after a few hours' standing. The yield is 89 g. (57 per cent of the theoretical amount). The compound is 97–100 per cent pure and for many purposes will not require recrystallization. Material of analytical purity may be obtained by one recrystallization from hot water. The decomposition point is about 325° (bloc Maquenne).
The crude bromo ester is mixed with 82.5 ml. (0.70 mole) of pure quinoline(Note 3) in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with an air condenser, and the mixture is heated for 3 hours with an oil bath maintained at 160–170°. The black mixture is cooled, treated with 150 ml. of 20% hydrochloric acid, then shaken thoroughly with 200 ml. of petroleum ether until most of the tarry material has dissolved(Note 4). The aqueous phase is separated and washed with an additional 200 ml. of petroleum ether, and the combined organic extracts are washed with 10% hydrochloric acid and then with water. This washing cycle is repeated until the washes are colorless (two acid washes usually suffice); finally, the petroleum ether solution is washed once more with water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the solvent is flash-distilled as described above, and the residual liquid ester is distilled through a 61-cm. Podbielniak-type column(Note 5). The colorless unsaturated ester distils at 153–154°/14.5 mm. after a small fore-run. The yield is 22–27 g. (70–85.5% based on 2-methyldodecanoic acid), n25D 1.4520–31, λmax 214 mμ, ε 12,300, in hexane, λmax 217 mμ, ε 12,800, in 95% ethanol.
The benzene distillate is yellow and contains some quinone. This, as well as the benzene from the final filtration of the quinone crystals, may be used in a subsequent run and thus raises the yield of the subsequent runs to about 85–90 g. (86–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a drying tube leading to a gas-absorption trap2 are placed 234 g. (1.1 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride and 65 g. (0.5 mole) of itaconic acid. The reagents are mixed by shaking the flask; after a few minutes a vigorous reaction commences, resulting in partial liquefaction of the mixture and copious evolution of hydrogen chloride. When the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is gently heated to cause reflux of phosphorus oxychloride until all the solid dissolves; then heating is continued for an additional 15 minutes. The reflux condenser is replaced by a 12-in. Vigreux column, and the phosphorus oxychloride is removed by distillation at reduced pressure provided by a water aspirator, the major portion coming over at about 45°/85 mm. When all the phosphorus oxychloride has been removed, the pressure is reduced (vacuum pump) and the material boiling at 70–75°/2 mm. is collected. Liquid boiling in this range weighs 50–55 g., representing a yield of 60–66%. This material, nD20 1.4915, nD25 1.4900, is pure enough for most purposes, but it may be further refined by distillation through a packed column, yielding 47–53 g. of a water-white liquid, nD20 1.4919, boiling at 71–72°/2 mm.
A solution of 450 g. (2 moles) of powdered stannous chloride dihydrate in 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in a 3-l. beaker provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer is cooled in an ice-salt bath. When the temperature of the solution has fallen to 5°, the ice bath is removed, and 100 g. (0.66 mole) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde is added in one portion. The temperature rises slowly at first, reaching 25–30° in about 5 minutes. As it then rises rapidly to about 100° the ice-salt bath is again placed around the beaker. Stirring must be vigorous or the reaction mixture may be forced out of the beaker. During the reaction the m-nitrobenzaldehyde dissolves, and an almost clear red solution is obtained. The solution is cooled with very slow stirring in an ice-salt mixture for 2.5 hours. The orange-red paste of the stannichloride of m-aminobenzaldehyde is filtered on a sintered-glass funnel.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and an efficient glass stirrer, are placed 700 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, 100 g. (0.3 mole) of recrystallized p-tolylmercuric chloride (p. 519), and 160 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium iodide (75 per cent excess). The mixture is boiled with vigorous stirring for fifteen hours; the solid does not entirely enter into solution at any time. The mixture is then thoroughly cooled and filtered by suction and the solid washed with water until free of inorganic halide. It is then dried in an air oven at 40° and recrystallized from 500 cc. of boiling xylene. In this way 45–50 g. (78–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 238° is obtained.
One hundred and thirty-one grams (3 moles) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde is added to 100 cc. of ether in a 2-l. bottle and cooled to 5° in an ice bath. One hundred and eighty grams (3.4 moles) of ammonium chloride dissolved in 550 cc. of water is then added, followed by an ice-cold solution of 150 g. (3.1 moles) of sodium cyanide in 400 cc. of water. The sodium cyanide must be added slowly and with frequent cooling to prevent loss of acetaldehyde by volatilization.
D. Methyl 5-methoxyindole-2-acetate, 5. A flame dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a condenser under argon is charged with 19.6 g (0.07 mol) of 4 followed by 450 mL of anhydrous methanol. A slurry of 1.9 g of 10% palladium over activated carbon in 20 mL of anhydrous methanol is added to the flask followed by 53.5 g (0.8 mol) of ammonium formate,. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr and then filtered through a bed of Celite. The Celite is washed with 100 mL of anhydrous methanol and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure to give a beige solid. The residue is triturated with 350 mL of cold water and the insoluble material is filtered and then dried to give 13.5–14.3 g (84–89%) of 5.
Three hundred and thirty-five grams of the 25% ethanolic solution of benzyltrimethylammonium ethoxide (0.43 mole) is placed under nitrogen in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a gas inlet tube, a gas-tight modified Hershberg stirrer, and a gas outlet tube fitted with a thermometer. All stoppers and rubber connections are wired in place with 16-gauge copper wire. There is obtained by evaporation at 40° under reduced pressure 97 g. (0.40 mole) of the ethoxide containing an equivalent of ethanol. The vacuum is broken with dry nitrogen.
B. Tris(2-perfluorohexylethyl)phenyltin . Phenyltin trichloride (2.46 mL, 15 mmol) is dissolved in dry benzene (30 mL) in a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask under argon at room temperature. The solution is slowly added to the 500-mL, three-necked flask containing the Grignard reagent at room temperature over 1 hr while stirring. The addition rate is adjusted to keep a constant temperature of about 25°C. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux overnight in an oil bath at 50°C, removed from the bath, and allowed to stand at ambient temperature for 4.5 hr with stirring. The reaction mixture is diluted with ether (100 mL), vacuum filtered into a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask, and hydrolyzed with saturated ammonium chloride solution (300 mL). Excess magnesium solid is also hydrolyzed with saturated ammonium chloride (100 mL) separately. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The water layer is removed, and the organic layer is washed three times with 3% sodium thiosulfate (3 × 200 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered under vacuum. The solvent is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure using a rotovap. The impure product is redissolved in ether (20 mL) and transferred to a 50-mL pear-shaped flask. The ether is removed under reduced pressure. Kugelrohr distillation is peformed to remove a dimer impurity of (C6F13CH2CH2CH2CH2C6F13) at 0.02 mm, 100-120°C for 5 hr. The residue is further purified by column filtration over silica (30 g) under pressure with hexane (1 L). The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure to leave 17.2 g (13.9 mmol, 93%) of pure compound as a colorless oil.
A 500-ml. Claisen flask with a 35-mm. indented side arm is attached downward to a Liebig condenser for distillation. A thermometer, held by a cork stopper, is inserted through the neck of the flask and adjusted so that its bulb is close to the bottom. The flask is heated by means of an electric mantle or air bath. To the flask are charged 94 g. (1.0 mole) of 2-aminopyridine, 150 g. (1.4 moles) of benzyl alcohol, and 9 g. of 85% potassium hydroxide. The mixture is heated to boiling and boiled vigorously enough to cause slow distillation of water accompanied by as little benzyl alcohol as possible. The temperature of the boiling mixture rises gradually from 182° to 250° during a period of 30 minutes. The mixture is maintained at 250° for 3 minutes, then allowed to cool. The distillate amounts to 19–20 ml. of a water-rich layer and 2–4 ml. of a benzyl alcohol-rich layer.
A. Butylmagnesium bromide . To a 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer, 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, reflux condenser and a glass stopper, is added 17.0 g (0.70 mol) of magnesium turnings. Stirring is started, and the system is flame-dried for 2 min. The flask is cooled to room temperature under a flow of argon, and 30 mL of ether is introduced to cover the magnesium. A solution of 24 mL (0.22 mol) of bromobutane in 70 mL of ether is placed in the pressure-equalizing addition funnel. Then, 1 mL (0.01 mol) of bromobutane is added to the suspension of magnesium in ether. The mixture is heated gently to initiate the reaction. When the reaction has started, the solution of bromide in ether is added dropwise at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux. After completion of the addition, the funnel is rinsed with 5 mL of ether . The gray solution is stirred for 15 min and then transferred to a dry flask under argon via cannula. The Grignard reagent is titrated with a solution of isopropyl alcohol in benzene using 1,10-phenanthroline as the indicator.2 A 1.90-2.10 M solution of Grignard reagent is obtained.
A dry 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient stirrer, a spiral reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, and all openings are protected by calcium chloride drying tubes. A suspension of 58 g. (1.07 moles) of sodium methoxide and in 330 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, and stirring is begun. To the stirred suspension is added dropwise a solution of 133 g. (1 mole) of 2-chlorocyclohexanone2 and diluted with 30 ml. of dry ether. The exothermic reaction is regulated by the rate of addition of the chloroketone; about 40 minutes is required for the addition. After the addition of the chloroketone is complete, the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 2 hours and is then cooled. Water is added until the salts are dissolved. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride. After extraction of the aqueous layer two 50-ml. portions of ether, the ethereal solutions are combined and washed successively with 100-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, and saturated sodium chloride solution. The ether solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, and the magnesium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed with ether. Removal of the ether by distillation at atmospheric pressure leaves the crude ester, which is distilled, with fractionation, at 70–73°/48 mm., n25D 1.4341. The yield of methyl cyclopentanecarboxylate is 72–78 g. (56–61%).
A. 1-Triisopropylsilyloxy-1-azidocyclohexane : A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, argon inlet, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with freshly-distilled 1-triisopropylsilyloxycyclohexene (25.47 g, 100 mmol, Note 2) and anhydrous dichloromethane (1.0 L, Note 3). Azidotrimethylsilane (68.5 mL, 500 mmol, Note 4) is added via syringe, immediately followed by anhydrous Dowex® 50 × 8-100 (24.98 g, Note 5) in a single portion from a dry flask. The suspension is stirred vigorously at ambient temperature for ca. 48 hr. The reaction mixture is filtered to recover the Dowex® resin and solvent is removed under reduced pressure to afford a clear, colorless oil. The crude oil is applied to a 5 × 13-cm column of silica gel (120 g, 230-400 mesh packed with hexanes). The column is quickly eluted with hexanes (750 mL) and fractions are collected in 25-mL test tubes. The fractions containing the desired product are identified by thin layer chromatography, combined, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford the 1-triisopropylsilyloxy-1-azidocyclohexane (26.75 g, 90%) as a colorless oil.
(A) Arsonoacetic Acid.—One hundred grams (0.51 mole) of powdered arsenious oxide is added to the hot solution obtained by dissolving 160 g. (4 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 cc. of water. After the solution has cooled to 20°, 48 g. (0.51 mole) of chloroacetic acid is added. The suspension is well stirred during about five minutes, when a strongly exothermic reaction begins, the temperature rises to 70–75°, and a clear solution results.
C. 2,6-Dioxo-1-phenyl-4-benzyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane. An oven-dried, 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 10.0 g (0.042 mol) of N-benzyl-N-methoxymethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine and 100 mL of anhydrous acetonitrile. N-Phenylmaleimide (7.3 g, 0.042 mol) is added, followed by 1.7 g (0.063 mol) of lithium fluoride. The reaction mixture is sonicated for 3 hr and poured into 100 mL of water. The mixture is extracted with three 100-mL portions of ether. The organic extracts are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is chromatographed on a silica gel column (300 g) using a 35% ethyl acetate:hexane mixture (ca. 1500 mL) as the eluant to give 9.2–9.6 g (72–75%) of 2,6-dioxo-1-phenyl-4-benzyl-1,4-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]octane as a pale yellow solid, mp 97–98°C.
A solution of 45 g. (0.25 mole) of trans-stilbene in 750 ml. of ether is prepared in a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel. To the well-stirred solution there is added 13.8 ml. (43 g.; 0.27 mole) of bromine, during the course of 10 minutes. A solid begins to separate in 5 minutes, but stirring is continued for 1 hour. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with ether until it is white. The yield of stilbene dibromide, melting at 235–237°, is 65.8–69.1 g. (77–81%).
To a cooled mixture of 200 cc. of water and 200 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is added slowly 176 g. (214 cc., 2 moles) of pentanol-2 (b.p. 118–120°). The flask is connected with a long efficient condenser for distillation. The end of the condenser is provided with an adapter which passes well into a receiver surrounded by ice water. The flask is heated on a boiling-water bath as long as distillation takes place (two to three hours).
The amine salt (147 g.) is placed in a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in 1 l. of 95% ethanol by heating the mixture on a steam bath. To the solution, which has been cooled to room temperature, is added 39 g. (35.8 ml.) of glacial acetic acid, and the solution is stirred. Water (900 ml.) is added cautiously at first and with vigorous agitation until crystals of abietic acid begin to appear; the remainder of the water is then added more rapidly. The abietic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with water until the acetic acid has been removed completely as indicated by tests with indicator paper. Recrystallization can be effected by dissolving the crude product in 700 ml. of 95% ethanol, adding 600 ml. of water as described above, and cooling the solution. The yield of abietic acid is 98 g. (40% based on the weight of isomerized rosin; [α]D24 −106° and. The ultraviolet absorption spectrum shows a maximum at 241 mμ; α = 77.0.
C. Mevalonolactone-2-13C. In a 250-mL Parr hydrogenation bottle are placed 50 mL of 95% ethanol, 0.107 g (0.001 mol) of palladium black, and 0.519 g (0.00217 mol) of 5-benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic acid-2-13C. The bottle is attached to a Parr hydrogenation apparatus, charged to 50 psig with hydrogen and shaken at room temperature for 2 hr. The hydrogen is flushed from the bottle with nitrogen, and the suspension is filtered by gravity through a layer of Celite with a medium-porosity sintered-glass Büchner funnel to separate the catalyst. The palladium is pyrophoric and must always be kept wet with ethanol during filtration to prevent contact with air. The bed of Celite and adhering catalyst is rinsed with three 5-mL portions of ethanol. The combined filtrates are returned to the Parr bottle, 0.107 g (0.001 mol) of fresh palladium black is added, and the hydrogenation is continued for another 8 hr. The catalyst is separated by filtration as previously described, and the combined filtrates are evaporated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residual liquid with a Kugelrohr apparatus at 90–100°C and 0.01 mm affords 0.235–0.249 g (83–88%) of mevalonolactone-2-13C as a slightly yellow oil.
B. 3,4-Cyclododeceno-1-methylbenzene. A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, septum inlet, and a magnetic stirring bar is fitted to a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is charged with 200 mL of toluene and 4.6 g (24 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc.). The solution is warmed to 80°C in a heating mantle. Tertiary alcohol 1 from the preceding step is dissolved in 150 mL of toluene and transferred to the flask by cannula. The progress of the reaction can be monitored by silica gel TLC eluting with 20% ethyl acetate in hexane. After 3 hr the reaction mixture is cooled to 22°C and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (2 × 100 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (4 × 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvents are removed under reduced pressure and the residue is purified by flash column chromatography on silica gel, eluting with hexane. The benzoannelated product is obtained as a pale yellow oil in 86% overall yield (12 g;).
A. Phenylhydrazine salt of β-phenyldithiocarbazic acid. In a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a dropping funnel, is placed a solution of 128 ml. (1.3 moles) of pure redistilled phenylhydrazine in 600 ml. of ordinary ether. To the vigorously stirred mixture, 52 ml. (0.86 mole) of carbon disulfide is added in the course of 30 minutes. After the mixture has been stirred for an additional 30 minutes, the precipitate is filtered with suction, washed with 50 ml. of ether, and spread on filter paper for 15–20 minutes to allow evaporation of the ether. The yield of the salt is 181–185 g. (96–98%).
The dimethylhydantoin is dissolved in the least boiling water (about 65 ml.) and digested with charcoal, and the hot solution is filtered through a heated filter. The filtrate is chilled, and the separated crystals are filtered with suction and washed sparingly with cold water. The recovery is about 80–85% of the crude weight. The recrystallized product melts at 174–175° (178° cor.). A further crop of less pure material (m.p. 171–172°) may be obtained by concentration of the mother liquor to small volume.
A. 1,10-Diazacycloöctadecane-2,9-dione. A 12-l., 4-necked, round-bottomed flask with four indents is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, two dropping funnels, and an inlet tube to maintain a static nitrogen atmosphere throughout the reaction. Four liters of benzene are placed in the flask and stirred vigorously. Two solutions, one of 33.8 g. (0.160 mole) of suberyl dichloride in 2.0 l. of benzene and the other of 48.2 g. (0.335 mole) of 1,8-diaminoöctane in 2.0 l. of benzene, are added simultaneously over a 6–7 hour period at room temperature. After the addition is complete, the resulting suspension is stirred slowly overnight. The addition funnels are removed from the flask and replaced by stoppers fitted with tubes of suitable dimensions to permit the reaction mixture to be siphoned from the reaction flask when a slight positive nitrogen pressure is present in the flask. The fine suspension in the reaction flask is agitated and siphoned into a large, fritted, filter funnel. The white solid is washed three times with benzene and dried in a vacuum oven. The resulting white solid is pulverized, placed in a continuous extractor, and extracted for three days with 1 l. of boiling benzene in a 2-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and heating mantle. After the extractor is allowed to cool to room temperature, filtration of the white solid suspension gives 23.1–23.6 g. (51–52%) of crude 1,10-diazacycloöctadecane-2,9-dione, m.p. 198–201°, which is used in the subsequent step without further purification.
Two hundred cubic centimeters (270 g., 2.1 moles) of technical methyl sulfate is placed in the dropping funnel, and, when the temperature inside the flask has dropped to 13°, a 20- to 30-cc. portion of the sulfate is added. An exothermic reaction should set in; the ice bath is removed, if necessary, to get the reaction to start. When the temperature begins to fall, the remainder of the methyl sulfate is admitted at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 12–15°; this takes at least twenty minutes. When the addition is complete the mixture is stirred an additional forty minutes; during this time the temperature will drop to about 5°. The stirrer is stopped, and the oily, upper layer is separated at once. The lower, aqueous layer is returned to the flask and methylated as before with a second 200-cc. portion of methyl sulfate.
B. 1-(Phenylsulfonyl)cyclopentene. A one-necked, flat-bottomed, cylindrical flask (5 cm in diameter and 23 cm in height) equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged in turn with phenyl benzeneselenosulfonate (15.0 g, 50.5 mmol), carbon tetrachloride (160 mL), and cyclopentene (11.1 mL, 126 mmol). The flask is equipped with a Friedrichs condenser and the stirred reaction mixture is blanketed with nitrogen. Following irradiation with 150-W sunlamp at room temperature for 45 min, the solution is transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator.
B. 2-Methyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonamido)-2-pentanol. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 8.4 g (0.1 mol) of 2-methyl-2-pentene, 100 mL of reagent-grade tert-butyl alcohol, 10 mL (1 mmol) of osmium tetroxide catalyst solution, and 35.2 g (0.125 mol) of chloramine-T trihydrate. Vigorous stirring is begun, and the reaction mixture is brought to 55–60°C by means of a heating mantle.
In a 500-cc. three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer, are placed 45.5 g. (0.25 mole) of 2,4-dinitrotoluene, 85 g. (1.5 moles) of iron, and 100 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol. The mixture is heated to boiling on a water bath, the stirrer is started, and a solution of 5.2 cc. (0.06 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 25 cc. of 50 per cent (by weight) ethyl alcohol is added slowly. The mixture is refluxed for two hours after addition of the acid is complete. At the end of this time the apparatus is disconnected and the hot mixture is made just alkaline to litmus by the addition of the calculated amount of 15 per cent alcoholic potassium hydroxide solution. Without allowing the mixture to cool, the iron is removed by filtration and the reaction flask is rinsed with two 50-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol; the same alcohol is used to wash the iron residue. To the filtrate is added 84 cc. of 6 N sulfuric acid; the normal sulfate of 2,4-diaminotoluene precipitates. The mixture is cooled to 25° and filtered by suction. The product is washed with two 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, dried in the air for two hours and then dried to constant weight at 110°. The yield is 49 g. (89 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts with decomposition at 249–251°.
In a 3-l. beaker a paste is made from 82 g. (0.21 mole) of 88 per cent technical Chicago acid (1-amino-8-naphthol-2,4-disulfonic acid) and 500 cc. of water, and solution effected by the addition of 8 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water, testing with litmus toward the end and leaving the reaction still acid. The solution is cooled to 18° by the addition of ice, and just before the coupling 35 g. (0.33 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate is added.
The product is now cooled, placed in a 4-l. beaker, and treated with solid sodium carbonate until just alkaline to litmus. water is added from time to time, to facilitate the reaction with the sodium carbonate and to prevent the separation of salt; about 500 cc. is required. The mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the aqueous layer separated. The crude dichlorohydrin, which weighs 1250 g., is distilled under reduced pressure. The first fraction boiling below 68°/14 mm. weighs 225 g., and consists of water and some dichlorohydrin; the dichlorohydrin is collected between 68° and 75°/14 mm., and weighs about 775 g. The water is separated from the first fraction, which is then redistilled and yields 100 g. of dichlorohydrin. A further amount of material (40–45 g.) may be obtained by extracting the aqueous layer obtained in the neutralization process with benzene. This is, however, hardly profitable. The neutralization and distillation will require about four hours.
B. Diphenylthiocarbazide. The above salt is transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and, while it is continuously stirred by hand, it is heated (hood) in a water bath maintained at 96–98°. After about 10–15 minutes the material softens to a taffylike mass, becomes yellow, foams, and evolves hydrogen sulfide. After about 20–30 minutes ammonia is evolved. When a distinct odor of ammonia is first detected, the beaker is removed from the bath, placed in a pan of cold water for 1 minute, and then surrounded immediately by cracked ice. About 150 ml. of absolute ethanol is added, the mixture is warmed slightly to loosen the mass, and the taffylike material is stirred until it is transformed into a granular precipitate. After the mixture has stood at room temperature for 1 hour, the precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of absolute ethanol. The yield of crude diphenylthiocarbazide is 100–125 g. (60–75% based on phenylhydrazine).
A 300-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a Trubore stirrer, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 100 ml. of methylene chloride. To this solvent is added without stirring 5.4 ml. (0.20 mole) of 90% hydrogen peroxide,,,. The hydrogen peroxide is not miscible with the solvent and separates as the lower layer at the bottom of the flask. The flask is then cooled in an ice bath, and the stirrer is started. To this cold solution over a 20-minute period is added 34.0 ml. (0.24 mole) of trifluoroacetic anhydride. After addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes.
An alkaline solution of sodium hypochlorite is prepared by passing chlorine (0.412 gram for each gram of the amide) into a mixture of 300 g. of cracked ice and a cold solution of 80 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water, contained in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask. The whole of the veratric amide (55–58 g.) is added in one portion, and the mixture is warmed slowly in a water bath, with mechanical stirring. The material soon darkens in color, and at 50–55° (internal temperature) oily droplets begin to separate. The temperature is raised gradually to 70° and maintained at this point for one hour. A solution of 120 g. of sodium hydroxide in 120 cc. of water is added slowly, and the temperature is increased to 80° for an additional hour.
B. (R)-(−)-N,N-Diethyl-(E)-citronellalenamine [(R)-(−)-N,N-Diethyl-3,7-dimethyl-1(E),6-octadienylamine]. From N,N-diethylgeranylamine. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a reflux condenser and an argon inlet is charged with 373 mg (0.40 mmol) of [(−)-2,2'-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl](η4-1,5-cyclooctadiene)rhodium(I) perchlorate. The flask is evacuated and refilled with argon 4 times. Another 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 83.8 g (0.40 mol) of N,N-diethylgeranylamine and 250 mL of distilled tetrahydrofuran under an argon blanket. This solution is transferred under argon by cannula to the flask containing the catalyst, which is then evacuated and refilled with argon twice. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for 21 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed under vacuum (60 mm) at 45°C. The residue is vacuum-distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to give 78.7 g (93.9%) of (R)-(−)-N,N-diethyl-(E)-citronellalenamine as a colorless liquid, bp 84–85°C (1.1 mm), [α]D25 −66.5° (hexane, c 10.2). The product is 97.2% chemically pure by GLC analysis,(Note 11),(Note 12).
In a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an efficient condenser, and an air inlet tube are placed 60.0 g. (0.370 mole) of cis,trans,trans-1,5,9-cyclododecatriene, 224.4 g. (7.00 moles) of 95% hydrazine, 350 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 3.0 g. (0.012 mole) of copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate. Air is bubbled through the reaction mixture with vigorous stirring for 8–12 hours or longer until the reaction mixture contains primarily the desired cis-monoolefin. During the early stages in the reaction a considerable amount of heat is generated and the temperature of the reaction mixture rises to 50–60°.2
A 50-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 20-ml. calibration mark is charged with 970 mg. (2.51 mmoles) of cholest-4-en-3β-ol. Ethyl vinyl ether is distilled into the flask to the 20-ml. mark. The mixture is stirred to effect solution before 820 mg. (2.55 mmoles) of mercury(II) acetate is added to the reaction mixture. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser connected to a gas-inlet tube and flushed with argon. The reaction mixture is then stirred and heated at reflux under a positive argon pressure for 17 hours. After the solution has cooled to room temperature, 0.062 ml. (1.1 mmoles) of glacial acetic acid is added, and stirring is continued for 3 hours. The reaction mixture is poured into a preshaken mixture of 150 ml. of petroleum ether and 50 ml. of 5% aqueous potassium hydroxide. The aqueous phase is extracted with 50 ml. of petroleum ether, and the combined extracts are washed with three 50-ml. portions of a 20% aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium carbonate, filtered and evaporated at reduced pressure, giving 1.11 g. of an oil which, upon filtration through 5 g. of silica gel with 200 ml. of petroleum ether, affords 0.81 g. of the cholestenyl vinyl ether as a clear, colorless oil. If desired, crystallization of this oil from 10 ml. of acetone will give 0.74 g. (71%) of the vinyl ether as colorless prisms, m.p. 55–56.5°.
B. N-tert-Butyl-N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine. Into a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed a solution of 22.8 g (0.16 mol of monomer) of nitroso-tert-octane in 500 mL of hexane. After the mixture is stirred for 1 hr, lead dioxide (132 g, 0.55 mol) is added. To the rapidly stirring mixture is added 48.8 g (0.55 mol) of tert-butylhydrazine dropwise at such a rate as to give brisk but controlled nitrogen evolution (approximately 30 min). Cooling is provided by an ice bath so as to maintain the reaction temperature between 15 and 25°C. Progress of the reaction is monitored visually by the disappearance of the blue nitroso monomer color. After the blue color has disappeared (about 1.5 hr), the lead oxides are removed by filtration through a pad of Celite and the residue is washed with ether/hexane (1 : 1). The filtrate and washes are combined and the solvents are removed at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator to give a 6 : 1 mixture of N-tert-butyl-N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine and N-tert-octyl-O-tert-butylhydroxylamine and.
While still hot the solution is acidified by adding 900 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) from a separatory funnel with a tube delivering the acid to the bottom of the flask; this prevents the formation of a layer of acid over the unneutralized solution. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then chilled in an ice bath. The resorcyclic acid crystallizes in prisms which are almost colorless but which, on exposure to air, turn pink owing to contamination with a small amount of resorcinol. The yield of crude acid is 225 g. By extracting the mother liquor with ether several times, 35 g. of resorcylic acid and some unchanged resorcinol can be recovered. The resorcylic acid is extracted from the ether by shaking with an aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate. The aqueous solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and again extracted withether. The ether is then evaporated, leaving the resorcylic acid, which is usually highly colored and must be recrystallized several times from boiling water and charcoal to remove the color.
To a suspension containing 20.5 g (72.61 mmol) of methyl 4,6-O-benzylidene-α-D-glucopyranoside in 1 L of carbon tetrachloride and 60 mL of 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane are added 15 g (84.27 mmol) of N-bromosuccinimide and 8 g (31.13 mmol) of barium carbonate. The resulting suspension is heated at the reflux temperature of the mixture with mechanical stirring for a 2.5-hr period and filtered while hot. During the initial period of heating, a reddish orange color develops but fades before termination of the reaction. The yellowish gummy residue in the flask is washed with two 100-mL portions of hot carbon tetrachloride and the filtrate and washings are evaporated under reduced pressure to give a pale-yellow oil that is dissolved in 500 mL of ether. The solution is washed with three 60-mL portions of water, then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation affords a pale-yellow oil that crystallizes on trituration with cold ether to yield 12.1 g of white crystals, mp 120–123°C. A second crop of 1.72 g is obtained from the mother liquors. Recrystallization of 1 g of product by dissolution in a minimum volume of acetone and addition of ether, then pentane gives 0.9 g of white crystals, mp 131–132°C; [α]D + 118° (CHCl3, c 1).
B. Benzophenone cyanohydrin. To the 250-mL flask, which contains the crude O-(trimethylsilyl) benzophenone cyanohydrin, is added 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 30 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is heated at 65°C (oil bath temperature) for 1 hr. The solution is poured into a separatory funnel and 30 mL of water is added. The aqueous phase is separated and back-extracted with three 100-mL portions of diethyl ether. The ethereal extracts are combined with the tetrahydrofuran solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and solvent is removed by evaporation on a rotary evaporator to give a yellow solid. The material is recrystallized from 300 mL of toluene and dried at a pressure of 0.05 mm overnight to give 17.7–18.8 g of white crystals. Concentration of the mother liquors to 100 mL produced a second crop of 1.1–3.8 g for a combined yield of 17.9–21.5 g (79–86%), mp 127–130°C.
In a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel are placed 36 g. (0.45 mole) of ethylene chlorohydrin, 5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 35 ml. of benzene. The mixture is warmed on a water bath, and to it is added, with efficient stirring, a solution of 55 g. (0.30 mole) of benzhydrol in 65 ml. of benzene during 30–50 minutes. The reaction mixture is heated at the reflux temperature for an additional 4 hours with stirring. To the cooled mixture is added about 35 ml. of benzene, and the combined benzene layer is washed with water and dried over calcium chloride. The drying agent is removed, the benzene is evaporated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The benzhydryl β-chloroethyl ether is collected at 144–148°/1.0 mm. (174–177°/4 mm.) as a colorless, viscous oil, n30D 1.5651, which should be removed from the receiver to a beaker or Erlenmeyer flask immediately after the distillation. The oil solidifies to a hard white mass, m.p. 27.4–27.8°, when kept in an ice chest. The yield is 60.0–65.3 g. (81–88%).
F. 1,4,7,10,13,16-Hexaäzacycloöctadecane (6). A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and addition funnel is charged with 200 g. (0.169 mole) of cyclic hexamine 5 and 500 ml. of concentrated (97%) sulfuric acid. The stirred mixture is held at 100° for 70 hours, then cooled in ice as 1300 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is slowly added. The precipitated polyhydrosulfate salt is filtered under nitrogen and washed with anhydrous ether. The salt is then stirred in 200 ml. of water and cooled in ice as 71 ml. of aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide is added to neutralize the solution. Activated carbon (3 g.) is added, and the solution is heated to 80° and filtered through Celite. The filtrate is cooled in ice and reacidified to pH 1 by adding 42 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The white, nonhygroscopic tris(sulfuric acid) salt of 6 that precipitates is collected and washed with 95% ethanol.
A. 1,1,3,3-Tetramethylbutyl isonitrile. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a nitrogen-inlet tube is flamed dry under a nitrogen atmosphere and allowed to cool. The nitrogen-inlet tube is replaced with a low-temperature thermometer, and the nitrogen line is attached to a Y-tube placed on the addition funnel. To the flask are added 118 g. (0.752 mole) of N-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)formamide and 1500 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide. The addition funnel is charged with a premixed solution of 89 g. (55 ml., 0.75 mole) of thionyl chloride and 250 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide. The flask is immersed in an acetone–dry ice bath, and moderately fast stirring is started. When the temperature of the flask reaches −50°, the solution in the funnel is added at a rate such that the temperature ranges between −55° and −50° (about 10 minutes are required for the addition). After the addition is complete, the bath is removed momentarily, allowing the reaction temperature to rise to −35°. The bath is then replaced, and 159 g. (1.50 mole) of dry sodium carbonate is added directly to the mixture. After the addition the bath is removed, and the flask contents are stirred for an additional 6 hours at room temperature. The reaction mixture is poured into a 6-l. Erlenmeyer flask containing 3 l. of ice water. The reaction flask is rinsed with 300 ml. of pentane and sufficient water to dissolve the inorganic material that may be present. The washings are added to the Erlenmeyer flask. The mixture is stirred vigorously for 5 minutes, and the layers are separated. The upper layer is washed twice with 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is filtered, and the pentane is removed by distillation. The crude product is distilled through a 1.5 × 15 cm. Vigreux column; the fraction collected at 55.5–56.6° (11 cm.), yields 86–90 g. (82–87%) of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl isonitrile, nD30 1.4178, d25 0.7944. The compound shows strong absorption in the IR (CCl4) at 2130 cm.−1 attributable to the isonitrile function. The 1H NMR spectrum (neat, external tetramethylsilane reference) shows peaks at δ 1.08 (s, 9H, C(CH3)3), 1.43 (t, J14N-H = 2 Hz., 6H, C(CH3)2), and 1.58 (t, J14N-H = 2.3 Hz., 2H, CH2).
After about fifteen minutes, the theoretical amount of freshly distilled n-butyl nitrite (95 g. for every 100 g. of phenylhydroxylamine) is added slowly through a dropping funnel and. The addition of butyl nitrite usually requires about one hour, during which time the stream of ammonia gas is continued in order that ammonia may always be in excess. If this precaution is not observed, a colored product will result. The temperature of the reaction mixture should be maintained below 10° and this may be done best by controlling the rate at which the butyl nitrite is added. An appreciable rise in temperature will cause the volatilization of considerable quantities of ether and of ammonia.
In a 5-l. two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a good mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser connected with a trap for absorbing the hydrogen chloride evolved, are placed 455 g. (3.4 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 1 l. (10.2 moles) of dry carbon tetrachloride. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath. The stirrer is started and when the temperature of the carbon tetrachloride has dropped to 10–15°, 50 cc. of dry thiophene-free benzene is added all at once. The reaction begins immediately as is indicated by the evolution of hydrogen chloride and a rising temperature. As soon as the reaction has started, salt is added to the ice in the cooling bath in order to get more effective cooling. When the temperature begins to fall after the reaction has started, a mixture of 550 cc. (a total of 6.7 moles) of thiophene-free benzene and 550 cc. (a total of 14.5 moles) of carbon tetrachloride is run in at such a rate that the temperature is kept between 5° and 10°. If efficient cooling is maintained, this addition requires one to two hours. The stirring is continued for about three hours after the benzene-carbon tetrachloride solution has been added, while the temperature is held at about 10°. The stirring is then discontinued and the mixture is allowed to stand about twelve hours. During this time the mixture comes to room temperature.
In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask surmounted by two large condensers and are placed 150 g. (3.75 moles) of powdered sodium hydroxide and 103.5 g. (1 mole) of γ-chlorobutyronitrile.1 The contents of the flask are well mixed by shaking, after which the mixture is heated on a steam bath; a rather vigorous reaction sets in. The water formed in the reaction hydrolyzes some of the cyclopropyl cyanide, so that after 1 hour's heating very little liquid is apparent. The hydrolysis of the cyanide is completed by the addition of water in small portions over a period of about 2 hours and subsequent heating; 15–20 ml. of water is added at first, and portions of 60–75 ml. later at intervals of 10–15 minutes until 500 ml. in all has been added. The mixture is then heated for an additional 1.5 hours with occasional stirring; at the end of this time the oily layer will have disappeared.
Two hundred forty-two grams (1 mole) of cetyl alcohol, 10 g. (0.32 gram atom) of red phosphorus, and 134 g. (1.06 gram atoms) of resublimed iodine are placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and heated in an oil bath until the alcohol has melted. The flask is then fitted with a reflux condenser and a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer. With stirring, the mixture is heated at 145–150° (temperature of the oil bath) for five hours. When the reaction mixture has cooled, the cetyl iodide is removed by extracting once with a 250-cc. portion and twice with 125-cc. portions of commercial ether. The combined ether extracts are filtered free of phosphorus and washed with 500 cc. of cold water, 250 cc. of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and again with 500 cc. of water. The ether solution is dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. After removal of the ether by distilling on a steam bath, the iodide is distilled under reduced pressure. The main fraction, distilling at 220–225°/22 mm. (210– 215°/12 mm.), weighs 300 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 18–20°. Redistillation gives 275 g. (78 per cent of the theoretical amount) boiling at 220–223°/22 mm. (203–205°/9 mm.) and melting at 20–22°.
A solution of 39.0 g (0.21 mol) of the cis-alkene in 100 mL of methanol is treated with concd sulfuric acid (ca. 0.8 mL of 30%), and the mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. Evaporation of the solvent and purification of the residue by silica chromatography ( 1 kg of silica, 8.5-cm × 43-cm column with ethyl acetate as eluant) yield 22.3 g (93%) of (S)-5-hydroxymethylfuran-2(5H)-one as a white crystalline solid, mp 40-41°C and [α] D 20 −150.8° (water, c 2.1).
After electrolysis the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered. The crystalline residue is washed three times with 100-mL portions of methanol, dried by suction on the filter, and finally dried under vacuum. The product (88.4–91 g, 67–69%) is obtained as a white solid, mp 134–135°C.
A. 2-Acetyl-2-phenylselenocyclohexanone. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a combined inlet-outlet assembly connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler. The flask is charged with 3.36 g. (0.140 mole) of sodium hydride, the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added. The suspension is stirred and cooled in an ice bath under a static nitrogen atmosphere as a solution of 14.02 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-acetylcyclohexanone in 15 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added over a 15-minute period. The formation of the sodium enolate is complete when hydrogen evolution ceases and a thick suspension has developed. Stirring and cooling are continued for 20 minutes, after which a solution of 20.1 g. (0.105 mole) of benzeneselenenyl chloride in 20 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is rapidly added. The contents of the flask are stirred at 0° for 15 minutes and poured into a beaker containing a magnetically stirred mixture of 200 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) diethyl ether-pentane, 50 ml. of aqueous 7% sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 50 g. of ice. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 50 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) ether–pentane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried by filtration through a cone of anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvents under reduced pressure gives 29.2–30 g. of crude, solid 2-acetyl-2-phenylselenocyclohexanone which is used in Part B without purification.
D. (4R-trans)-2-Butyl-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl[1,3,2]dioxaborolane-4,5-dicarboxamide 3. A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirrer, under argon is charged with 7.70 g (45.0 mmol) of the butylboronate diethanolamine complex and 11.9 g (58.3 mmol) of (R,R)-(+)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyltartaric acid diamide. The solids dissolve upon the addition of 225 mL of dichloromethane . Brine (70 mL) is added, and the resulting biphasic solution is stirred for 30 min under argon. The two layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (50 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and dried under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) to give 11.3 g (93%) of the title compound as a pale yellow oil.
C. 2,3,4,5,6-Penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconyl chloride. Anhydrous 2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconic acid (25 g., 0.062 mole) is shaken with 185 ml. of anhydrous ethyl ether in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask until most of the solid dissolves. Then 15 g. (0.072 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride is added with shaking. The flask is fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube and stored overnight at room temperature. Any solid material is removed by filtration through a fritted-glass funnel into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, and the ethereal solution is concentrated to about one-half volume under reduced pressure at room temperature. The concentrated solution is allowed to stand overnight at 0° or below. The mother liquor is decanted from the crystals, which are then broken up, transferred to a fritted-glass funnel, washed quickly with petroleum ether (b.p. 35–55°), and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The mother liquor is again concentrated to one-half its volume under reduced pressure and a second crop of crystals collected. The total yield of 2,3,4,5,6-penta-O-acetyl-D-gluconyl chloride, melting at 68–71°, is 21–24 g. (80–92%), depending on the temperature of crystallization and.
In a 3-l. beaker a mixture of 20 g. (0.146 mole) of anthranilic acid, 700 cc. of warm water (35°), and 11 cc. (11.6 g., 0.19 mole) of glacial acetic acid is stirred mechanically and allowed to cool to room temperature. A freshly prepared solution of 15 g. (0.185 mole) of potassium cyanate in 50 cc. of water is then added dropwise with stirring over a period of fifteen to twenty minutes. The resulting pasty mixture is stirred for twenty minutes, and then 200 g. (5 moles) of flaked sodium hydroxide is added slowly in small portions. During this addition the reaction mixture is kept below 40° by cooling in a cold-water bath. A clear solution is obtained momentarily, but in a short time a fine granular precipitate of the hydrated monosodium salt of benzoylene urea precipitates. After the mixture has cooled overnight in an ice box, the precipitated sodium salt is collected on a Büchner funnel, using a hardened filter paper. The colorless salt is dissolved in 1 l. of hot water (90–95°), and the solution is filtered and heated to boiling in a 3-l. beaker. The benzoylene urea is precipitated by adding dilute sulfuric acid (1:1) with vigorous stirring until the liquor is acid to litmus. The product separates as a hydrate which forms small, lustrous, colorless needles. The material is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 200 cc. of water, and dried in an oven at 100°. The yield is 19.5–20.5 g. (82–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 86 g. (1 mole) of γ-butyrolactone and 72 g. (1.1 moles) of potassium cyanide. As the contents of the flask are stirred, the mixture is heated in an oil bath for 2 hours at a temperature of 190–195°. There is an initial vigorous reaction which soon subsides. After the completion of the heating period the mixture is cooled to about 100°, and the potassium salt of the cyano acid is dissolved in about 200 ml. of hot water. The warm solution is cautiously acidified to Congo red by the addition of about 90 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resultant solution, which contains glutaric acid monoamide and potassium chloride, is used to prepare glutaric acid or glutarimide.
A. Phthalylglycyl chloride. Phthalylglycine (102.5 g, 0.5 mol;) is placed in a 750-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. Thionyl chloride (109 mL, 1.5 mol,) is added in one portion and the resulting suspension is stirred at reflux for 18 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature before removing excess thionyl chloride under reduced pressure. The residue is suspended in ether (100 mL,) and stirred for 1 hr at 0°C. The crystals are filtered by suction using a Büchner funnel, washed with cold ether (50 mL), and dried under vacuum. Approximately 100 g of phthalylglycyl chloride (90% based on phthalylglycine) is obtained.
The moist material is washed into a solution of 30 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of water, and the mixture is heated rapidly nearly to the boiling point. In about 10 minutes all the ether is hydrolyzed and a deep red solution results. The hot solution is filtered by suction from a trace of residue, transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and acidified while still hot by adding 130 ml. of 6 N hydrochloric acid slowly, and with good stirring. The yellow suspension of hydroxynaphthoquinone thus obtained is cooled to 0° and allowed to stand for 2 hours. The hydroxynaphthoquinone is collected, washed with 2 l. of cold water, dried overnight at room temperature, and finally to constant weight at 60–80°. The yield is 101–112 g. (58–65% based on ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate; 99%, based on methoxynaphthoquinone). The hydroxynaphthoquinone thus obtained is bright yellow, is granular, and melts, with decomposition, at about 188–189°. It is of high quality and for ordinary uses requires no further purification.
In a 12-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser and an efficient, liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer are placed 2.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, 872 g. (3.5 moles) of pure n-dodecyl bromide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 29, and p. 246 above), and 278 g. (3.85 moles) of powdered 90 per cent potassium cyanide. The mixture is refluxed for fifteen hours, with stirring, in a water bath. At the end of this time another 278-g. portion of potassium cyanide is added and the mixture refluxed, with stirring, for fifteen hours longer.
Three hundred forty-five grams (1.7 moles) of ethyl ethoxalylpropionate, b.p. 114–116°/10 mm. (p. 272), is placed in a round-bottomed flask of suitable size carrying a reflux condenser, and a thermometer is suspended from the top of the condenser into the liquid. The ethyl ethoxalylpropionate is then heated until a vigorous evolution of carbon monoxide begins (130–150°). The temperature of the liquid is gradually raised as the gas evolution diminishes, and finally the liquid is refluxed until no more gas comes off. The ethyl methylmalonate is then distilled. It boils at 194–196°/745 mm., and the yield is 288 g. (97 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The mixture is refluxed gently for 4 hours. The flask is cooled and equipped for distillation, and the fraction boiling at 40–60° is collected in an ice-cooled receiver. The crude amine, including any collected in the trap, weighs 37–39 g. It is dried overnight with 5–7 g. of sodium hydroxide pellets and then distilled, a 12- to 15-cm. fractionating column and an ice-cooled receiver equipped with a soda-lime tube being used. The fraction boiling at 44–46° amounts to 31–34 g. (71–78%) of tert-butylamine; d420 0.699; nD20 1.3800.
The dark-colored residue is divided into two approximately equal portions, and each is poured, while still hot, into a 4-l. beaker. After the liquid has cooled to about 70°, 1650 cc. of acetone is added to each portion. The mixture is stirred well, so that as much as possible of the dark-colored solid is brought into contact with the acetone. After standing in the icebox overnight, the β-bromoethylamine hydrobromide is collected on a filter, washed with acetone until colorless, and air-dried for about fifteen minutes. The filtrates are combined, concentrated to a volume of 1 l., and cooled. After seeding, a second crop of nearly pure material is obtained. By evaporation to a syrup, cooling, and seeding, a third crop of slightly colored material is obtained.. The yield is about 2.8 kg. (83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The compound gives a crystalline 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone, m.p. 163–164°, from ethanol.
The solvent is evaporated with an air jet at room temperature, and to the residual solid is added saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution until effervescence ceases. Filtration of the remaining solid followed by washing with water and cold ethanol gives 6.5 g. (30%) of crude α,α'-dibromodibenzyl sulfone, m.p. 142–158°. This mixture of diastereomers is pure enough for use in conversion to 2,3-diphenylvinylene sulfone.
A solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 800 cc. of water is prepared in a 2-l. beaker. To the warm solution is added 211 g. (1 mole) of 3-nitrophthalic acid (p. 408). A small amount of insoluble material is removed by filtration through a large preheated Büchner funnel. A solution of 350 g. (1.1 moles) of mercuric acetate in a mixture of 50 cc. of glacial acetic acid and 700 cc. of water is prepared by heating and filtering while hot. The two hot solutions are poured into a 3-l. long-necked flask and mixed by shaking. No precipitate should separate. The flask is clamped in a large oil bath with the level of the oil almost to the neck of the flask. It is fitted with a reflux condenser provided with a tube leading to a large beaker placed on the desk.
The flask is cooled to 0° with crushed ice, and 150 ml. of dichloromethane is added with stirring. The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-l. beaker containing 500 ml. of water and 500 ml. of crushed ice; material remaining in the flask is rinsed into the beaker with 10 ml. of dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred thoroughly, further salts being precipitated, until the ice just melts, and filtered into a cooled filter flask under reduced pressure through a sintered or Büchner funnel and a kieselguhr filter-aid cake. The beaker and filter cake are washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the clear combined filtrate is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel while still cold.
The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for several hours (preferably overnight) and is then extracted repeatedly with 500-cc. portions of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, until the alkaline extracting medium remains practically colorless when shaken with the ethereal solution. Usually five 500-cc. portions of the sodium hydroxide solution are required. The combined alkaline extracts are poured slowly, with stirring, into a mixture of 700–750 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and about 1 kg. of ice. The crystals of isonitrosopropiophenone are filtered with suction and dried. The product weighs 370–390 g. (65–68 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 111–113°. This material can be crystallized from about 550 cc. of toluene and yields 315–335 g. of snow-white crystals, m.p. 112–113°.
B. α,α'-Diphenylthiodiglycolic acid. In a 4-l. Erlenmeyer flask a suspension of 223 g. (1.04 moles) of α-bromophenylacetic acid in 1.25 l. of water is brought into solution by addition of a solution of 157 g. (1.48 moles) of sodium carbonate in 700 ml. of water. A solution of 104 g. (0.8 mole) of sodium sulfide (60–62% pure fused flakes) in 700 ml. of water is added, and the resulting mixture is stirred mechanically at room temperature for 3 hours, heated to the boiling point, filtered while hot, cooled, and cautiously acidified (in a hood) with 3 N hydrochloric acid. Filtration followed by washing with 200 ml. of water yields 135–140 g. (86–89%) of crude acid, m.p. 130–140°, which is sufficiently pure for use in the next step.
The mixture is now transferred to a 12-l. flask, 495 g. (625 cc., 8.5 moles) of acetone is added, and the solution is heated on the steam bath to 70°. Heating is then discontinued, the flask wrapped in burlap in order to retard loss of heat, and the mixture allowed to stand overnight. The acid is then neutralized with a concentrated (50 per cent) solution of sodium hydroxide (about 720 g. of alkali is required), until a distinctly alkaline reaction to litmus is just obtained.
Chloroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal (31.11 g, 0.20 mol) is added by syringe slowly, since the initial reaction is exothermic. The resulting solution is heated at 50°C with stirring for 2 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, solvent is removed, first with a rotary evaporator and then with an oil pump overnight. The residue is taken up in ethyl ether, and filtered by suction through a 1½-in. plug of Celite packed in a 250-mL, coarse-porosity, fritted Schlenk tube and. The filtrate is collected in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar. The sodium chloride residue is washed several times with fresh ether until the washings are nearly colorless. The filter tube is removed and the flask is capped with a rubber septum and a nitrogen inlet; air is displaced by flushing the flask is capped with nitrogen.
In a 36-cm. evaporating dish are placed 1350 g. (1.5 l., 23 moles) of c.p. aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90), 900 cc. of distilled water, 375 cc. of 10 per cent gelatine solution, and 1200 cc. of the normal sodium hypochlorite solution prepared as above. This mixture is heated as rapidly as possible and boiled down until one-third of the original volume is left. This solution is then cooled thoroughly with ice and filtered with suction, first through two layers of toweling and then through one thickness of ordinary filter paper over cloth, in order to remove finely divided solid impurities. The solution is then placed in a precipitating jar, and cooled thoroughly (0°) with ice and salt; 10 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid for each 100 cc. of solution is gradually added with constant stirring. A precipitate of hydrazine sulfate (NH2NH2 · H2SO4) forms. The mixture is allowed to stand in the cold for a few hours in order to complete the precipitation, and is then filtered by suction in the usual way and the precipitate washed with cold alcohol. The yield varies from 53 g. to 58 g. per 1.5 l. of aqueous ammonia (34–37 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is perfectly white and crystalline, and satisfactory for almost any purpose. If a very pure product is desired, it must be recrystallized from water. For every 21 g. of crude product, 100 g. of boiling water is used. If the crude hydrazine is brown, it is advisable to use a little animal charcoal. After the mixture has been filtered and cooled to 0°, 19 g. of pure white crystals are obtained.
Upon completion of the reaction the solution is acidified with acetic acid, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in about 1.4 l. of ether and filtered into a 2-l. separatory funnel through fluted paper. After the ether solution has been washed with two 300-ml. portions of 5% aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, the ether is removed on a steam bath. The residue is dissolved in about 1.5 l. of warm methanol, and the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystallized product is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel and pressed well. The product is rather waxy and is best washed by transferring it to a beaker and stirring thoroughly with about 150 ml. of cold methanol. The white crystals are then collected and pressed well again. If the filtrate is colored, the crystals are washed again with a smaller quantity of methanol. The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to one-half the original volume and chilled in ice to yield a few grams of additional product of the same melting point. The combined lots are dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield amounts to 116–126 g. (68–74%) of white, microcrystalline dimethyl octadecanedioate, m.p. 57–58°.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed a solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 320 cc. of water and 181 g. (1 mole) of methyl m-nitrobenzoate (not recrystallized, p. 372). The mixture is heated to boiling during five to ten minutes or until the saponification is complete as shown by the disappearance of the ester.
A mixture of 1350 cc. of water and 1650 cc. (20 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is placed in a 30 by 30 cm. glass jar or a 40-l. crock and stirred mechanically while strongly cooled by an ice-salt mixture. Two thousand and seventy-five grams (16 moles) of aniline hydrochloride and a solution of 1.2 kg. (17 moles) of sodium nitrite in 1.5 l. of water are made ready. When the temperature of the acid has reached 5° or below, about one-third of the aniline hydrochloride is added to it, and diazotization is begun by the slow addition of the nitrite solution, the temperature being held below 7°. Additional aniline hydrochloride is added from time to time in such amounts that an excess of crystals is always present. The entire amount may be added by the time that half of the nitrite has been added. The diazotization is stopped when a positive test for free nitrous acid is obtained with potassium iodide starch paper. This should require nearly all the nitrite solution.
A. p-Acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide.3 A 2-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 117.0 g (0.50 mol) of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl chloride and 1 L of acetone. A solution of 39.0 g (0.60 mol) of sodium azide in 300 mL of water is added with stirring and the resulting mixture is left to stir for 12 hr. Three 2-L beakers equipped with magnetic stirrers are charged with 1.5 L each of water. The reaction mixture is divided into three portions and poured into the beakers with stirring. After the mixture is stirred for 1 hr, the white precipitate is filtered and dried in a desiccator over sodium hydroxide for 24 hr. Recrystallization of this material in four portions from toluene (1.5 L each portion), while the temperature is maintained below 80°C, affords 88.9 g (74%) of p-acetamidobenzenesulfonyl azide as white crystals, mp 113°-115°C.
A 250-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a steam-jacketed column (15–20 cm. long) terminating in a still head. The still head carries a thermometer and is connected to a condenser set for downward distillation. In the flask are placed 42.2 g. (0.22 mole) of ethyl benzoylacetate and 50 ml. of dry xylene, and the flask is immersed in an oil bath. The bath is heated to 145–150°, stirring is begun, and 18.2 ml. (18.6 g., 0.20 mole) of aniline is added dropwise during 30 minutes. About 5 minutes after the addition has begun, the temperature in the still head rises to 75–78° as ethanol begins to distil. Approximately 12–14 ml. of distillate is collected in a 25-ml. graduate in about 1 hour; the end of the reaction is indicated by the fall of the temperature in the still head.
The solution in the left flask is stirred for 30 minutes after all the potassium amide has been added. The nitrogen inlet is briefly removed and 120 g. (1.5 moles) of ammonium nitrate is added; this discharges the chartreuse color. ( Caution: Vigorous foaming occurs.) Ethyl ether (500 ml.) is added and the dry ice condenser is replaced by a standard water-cooled condenser. The ammonia is evaporated by allowing the stirred reaction mixture to warm to room temperature; this takes several hours and it is convenient to have it occur overnight.
A mixture of 280 g. (1.5 moles) of commercial benzidine and 880 cc. (10.2 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask and warmed on a steam bath for one to two hours, with occasional shaking, to form the dihydrochloride. The flask is then equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel, and cooled, with stirring, to −10° in an ice-salt bath. When this temperature has been reached, the benzidine dihydrochloride is tetrazotized over a period of two hours with a solution of 232 g. (3.2 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 800 cc. of water, until a faint test for nitrous acid with starch-iodide paper is obtained after twenty minutes. During this reaction, the temperature is kept below −5°.
A 5-l. flask is fitted with a separatory funnel and arranged for steam distillation (p. 64). Two liters of crushed ice is placed in the flask, and the sulfuric acid solution, cooled to 0°, is slowly added. The amines are then liberated by adding cold concentrated sodium hydroxide solution (650 g. in 1.5 l. of water) through the separatory funnel. The amines are steam-distilled and collected in a solution of 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 200 ml. of water. Distillation is continued until all amine has passed over, as indicated by a negative test with litmus paper. About 2 l. of distillate is usually required.
In the flask is placed 64 g. (43 cc., 0.9 mole) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.49), the stirrer is started, and about one-sixth of the crude β-chloropropionaldehyde is added very slowly through the separatory funnel. About 1 cc. of the aldehyde is added to the acid. The temperature remains constant for one or two minutes and then slowly rises. As the oxidation begins, oxides of nitrogen are evolved and are drawn off by means of the water pump. When the temperature of the reaction mixture reaches about 30°, the flask is immersed in a water bath (at 15–20°) and the rate of addition of the aldehyde is regulated so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is 30–35°. After the addition of the last portion of the aldehyde, stirring is continued until the temperature drops below 25°. This oxidation requires about twenty-five minutes.
C. Diethyl benzoylmalonate. The dropping funnel used for the chlorocarbonate addition is replaced by another into which the ethereal solution of the ethoxymagnesium compound has been transferred. Approximately 30 ml. of dry ether is used to rinse the flask, and this is also added to the dropping funnel. The ether solution is added to the mixed anhydride with stirring, as the temperature is held at −5° to 0°. After the mixture has been allowed to stand overnight and to come to room temperature during this time, it is treated cautiously with 400 ml. of 5% sulfuric acid; then the aqueous solution is separated and extracted once with ether. The two organic layers are combined, washed once with dilute sulfuric acid and then with a concentrated sodium bicarbonate solution until no further benzoic acid is obtained from acidification of the bicarbonate extracts. The organic layer is washed with water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of the sodium sulfate by filtration, the solvent is removed at water-pump pressure from a water bath held at about 50°. The resulting product is purified by distillation through a 30-cm. Vigreux column, and the fraction boiling at 144–149°/0.8 mm. is collected. The yield is 35.8–39.4 g. (68–75%), n25D 1.5063–1.5066.
The dried benzene extract is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask with a ground-glass joint. The flask is fitted with a Vigreux column, and the benzene is distilled from the solution at atmospheric pressure, an oil bath maintained at 100–110° being the source of heat. The crude γ-di-n-butylaminopropylamine is fractionated under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. Claisen flask; heat is supplied by an oil bath maintained at 170–180°. The yield of product boiling at 108–110.5°/5–6 mm. or 98–100°/2 mm. amounts to 57–60 g. (77–80%).
A. Diisopropoxytitanium(IV) dibromide. A 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed pre-weighed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and an argon inlet is charged with 20 mL of hexane and titanium(IV) bromide (7.3 g, 20 mmol). To the red-brown suspension is added titanium(IV) isopropoxide (5.9 mL, 20 mmol) slowly (~ 7 min) at ambient temperature from a syringe. The addition of titanium(IV) isopropoxide causes the mixture to warm to about 37°C. After stirring for 10 min, the now yellow solution is allowed to stand for 6 hr at room temperature, and the pale yellow precipitate that forms is isolated by removing the supernatant liquid with a syringe. The solid residue is then washed with hexane (5 mL × 2) and recrystallized from hexane (10 mL). Recrystallization is carried out in the same flask by heating the solution to reflux and then leaving it at room temperature overnight. Again the supernatant liquid is removed with a syringe and the crystalline residue is vacuum dried to give 5.7 g (44%) of yellow, highly moisture sensitive product. While still in the original flask, this product is dissolved in 88 mL of dry toluene to give a 0.2 M solution.
1,4-Dibromobutane (23.8 g., 0.110 mole) is injected into the addition funnel and added to the solution with stirring over a period of about 15 minutes. The funnel is rinsed by injection of 5 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran, and the reaction is stirred at −78° for 45 minutes. n-Butyllithium (55 ml., 0.12 mole) in n-hexane is injected into the addition funnel and added to the solution over a period of 15 minutes. The reaction is stirred at −78° for 1 hour and stored at −20° overnight. The mixture is poured into about 300 ml. of ice water and acidified to pH 2–3 with 9 N hydrochloric acid. The acidic solution is shaken with three 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether, and the ether extracts are discarded. The aqueous layer is made basic by careful addition of 40% sodium hydroxide. The resulting mixture is shaken with four 200-ml. portions of ether, and the ether extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, giving 24.4–25.8 g. (90–95%) of crude 2-(1-phenylcyclopentyl)-4,4,6-trimethyl-5,6-dihydro-1,3(4H)-oxazine, which is sufficiently pure for use in the following step.
After addition of a magnetic stir bar, the flask is capped with a septum, placed under an argon atmosphere, and the crude adduct is diluted with dichloromethane (35 mL). Triethylamine (16.7 mL, 120 mmol) is added dropwise by syringe over 10 min. The resulting orange-brown mixture is stired for 9 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, bath temperature) to about half of its original volume, and the concentrate is charged onto a column (8 × 18 cm) of 350 g of silica gel. The column is eluted with 500 mL of tert-butyl methyl ether/cyclohexane (1:4), at which time the eluent is changed to tert-butyl methyl ether/cyclohexane (3:7). After elution with about 1 L of the solvent mixture, the product begins to emerge, as identified by TLC analysis. The eluting solvent is changed to tert-butyl methyl ether/cyclohexane (1:1), and the product fractions are collected. Combination of the fractions, concentration by rotary evaporation (35 °C, bath temperature), and vacuum drying afforded 13.45–13.85 g of 1 as a colorless oil (88–90% yield).
The flask is replaced and completely surrounded by an ice bath. A current of nitrogen is passed through the flask for 5 minutes by means of a rubber tube attached to the dropping funnel. The nitrogen inlet tube is removed, and a mixture of 60 g. (0.44 mole) of o-hydroxyacetophenone and 125 g. (140 ml., 1.2 moles) of ethyl propionate is placed in the dropping funnel and protected by a soda-lime tube. The ester-ketone mixture is dropped very slowly onto the powdered sodium. After a small amount (2–5 ml.) of the mixture has been added, the ice bath is removed and the flask warmed with the hand to make sure that the reaction has started. When the reaction has started, the funnel is adjusted so that one-half of the ester-ketone mixture is added over a period of 1.5–2 hours. After half of the mixture has been added, the rate of addition is again regulated so that the remainder is added in 30 minutes.
F. Dimethyl 3-phenylpyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylate. A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with dimethyl 4-phenyl-1,2-diazine-3,6-dicarboxylate (1.36 g, 0.005 mol) and glacial acetic acid (55 mL,). Zinc dust (3.25 g, 0.05 mol,) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 6 hr. A second portion of zinc dust (3.25 g, 0.05 mol) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 18 hr. The zinc dust is removed by filtration through a pad of Celite and the residue is washed with ether (100 mL). The filtrate and washes are combined, made basic (pH 10) with the addition of saturated sodium bicarbonate, and extracted with ether (2 × 100 mL). The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the product is effected by flash chromatography on a 4.5 × 9-cm column of silica gel (Aldrich 951, CH2Cl2 eluant), collecting 20-mL fractions. The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (Kieselgel 60, CH2Cl2 eluant) and those containing product are combined and concentrated in vacuo to give 0.676 g (52%) of dimethyl 3-phenylpyrrole-2,5-dicarboxylate as a white solid: mp 122–123°C (ethyl acetate-hexane,).
A. 3-Benzoyl-N-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one . A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, heating mantle, and reflux condenser, is charged with 26.7 g (0.665 mol) of 60% sodium hydride (NaH,) and 250 mL of dry toluene. The stirred suspension is heated at reflux while a mixture of 55.0 g (0.50 mol) of freshly distilled N-vinylpyrrolidin-2-one and 75.0 g (0.50 mol) of ethyl benzoate is slowly added. Heating is continued for 10 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the resultant thick slurry is carefully diluted with 250 mL of saturated, aqueous ammonium chloride . The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted again with 250 mL of toluene . The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 108 g (>100%) of crude keto lactam product as an amber oil that may solidify on standing.
The crude bis ester is melted on a steam cone and poured into a 3-l. round-bottomed flask containing 600 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 40 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and approximately 10 g. of small chips of porous plate. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. There is a copious evolution of carbon dioxide which should be directed to a gas-absorption trap since it is accompanied by acetic acid vapors. The mixture is poured, with mechanical stirring, into 2 l. of ice water in a 4-l. beaker. Enough ether is added to allow separation of the layers, and the organic layer is returned to the beaker with 1.2–1.3 l. of water. With the aid of good stirring the mixture is neutralized by slow addition of solid sodium carbonate until the effervescence ceases. The layers are separated, and the material so obtained may be used immediately for the preparation of 3,5-dimethyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. To obtain 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, the ether solution is washed with 100 ml. of 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with 100 ml. of water containing 2 ml. of acetic acid, is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled through a short column under reduced pressure. After a very slight fore-run the main fraction is collected at 135–155°/10 mm. This is redistilled through a moderately good column, preferably of the Widmer or Vigreux type. The product is 3,5-dimethyl-4-carbethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one, b.p. 136–138°/9 mm. The yield is 220–234 g. (47–50%).
To a mixture of 292 g. (332 cc., 3.7 moles) of dry benzene and 116 g. (73.2 cc., 0.75 mole) of dry carbon tetrachloride, in a 1-l. flask provided with a reflux condenser having a calcium chloride tube at its upper end, is added 100 g. (0.75 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride in lumps. The flask is at once immersed in ice water to within 5 cm. of the top, and allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, the temperature of the water being allowed to rise to that of the room. One hundred and ten grams (153 cc., 1.48 moles) of anhydrous ether is added in small portions, through the condenser, the flask being shaken occasionally during the twenty minutes required for the addition.
B. Diphenylketene. A 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a gas-inlet tube, a calcium chloride drying tube, and a dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 23.0 g. (0.0997 mole) of diphenylacetyl chloride in 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, dry nitrogen is passed through the system, and 10.1 g. (0.100 mole) of triethylamine is added dropwise over 30 minutes to the stirred solution; triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates as a colorless solid, and the ether becomes bright yellow in color. When addition of the triethylamine is complete, the flask is tightly stoppered and stored overnight at 0°. The hydrochloride is collected on a 9-cm., sintered glass funnel and washed with anhydrous ether until the washings are colorless. The ether is removed under reduced pressure; the residual red oil is transferred to a 50-ml., distilling flask fitted with a 10-cm. Vigreux column and distilled, giving 10.2–10.8 g. (53–57%) of diphenylketene as an orange oil, b.p. 118–120° (1 mm.). It can be stored at 0° in a tightly stoppered bottle for several weeks without decomposition.
A. N-Methylbenzimine . Under a well-ventilated hood, a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with an aqueous solution (40% w/w, 100 mL) of methylamine . Freshly distilled benzaldehyde (26.5 g, 0.25 mol) is added to the stirred solution of methylamine at room temperature. A mildly exothermic reaction occurs resulting in a milky white emulsion. The Erlenmeyer flask is stoppered and the mixture is stirred overnight (15 hr). The milky emulsion is transferred to a separatory funnel, diethyl ether (200 mL) is added, and the organic phase is separated and dried over potassium carbonate (K2CO3). The solids are removed by filtration, washed with ether (50 mL), and the combined filtrate and washings are concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column using a water aspirator to give 28.3 g (95%) of imine as a water white liquid (bp 99-100°C/25 mm).
In order to evaporate the solution, the flask is then placed in an oil bath, which is brought to a temperature of 150–155°. As soon as solid material begins to separate, the mixture will bump badly unless a rather rapid current of air is passed through the reaction mixture. This has the further advantage of hastening the evaporation. The heating is continued until a thick, pasty, gray mass is left as a residue, the process requiring thirty to forty minutes. The mixture is allowed to cool and then made strongly acid by the addition of 800 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. This must be done slowly and under a hood on account of the rapid evolution of hydrogen bromide.
A. (E)-1-Decenyldiisobutylalane. An oven-dried, 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum inlet, and an outlet connected to a mercury bubbler is flushed with nitrogen, immersed in a water bath kept at room temperature, and charged with 22.6 mL (125 mmol) of 1-decyne and 80 mL of hexane. To this flask is added dropwise, with stirring, 22.3 mL (125 mmol) of diisobutylaluminum hydride using a syringe. After the addition has been completed, the water bath is replaced with an oil bath kept at 50–60°C, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hr at this temperature.
D. Recovery of (S)-(−)-α-methylbenzylamine. The aqueous layer (see above, B, 3rd paragraph) contained in a 1000-mL flask is cooled in an ice bath under a nitrogen atmosphere. An aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide solution is added with stirring until a pH of 12–14 is reached. The mixture is transferred to a 2000-mL separatory funnel and extracted three times with ether (1000-mL total amount). The organic phase is washed twice with 100 mL of water and twice with 30 mL of brine, then dried over potassium carbonate and filtered. The solution is concentrated at room temperature with a rotary evaporator and distilled under reduced pressure to afford 85–90 g (85–90% yield) of the amine, bp 70°C (15 mm), the specific rotation of which is the same as that of the original starting material.
The aqueous distillate is made alkaline with sodium hydroxide solution and the p-bromotoluene is separated from the water layer. The crude product weighs 131–137 g. For purification the crude product is washed once with concentrated sulfuric acid and then with water. It is dried over a little calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled. The yield of pure product amounts to 120–126 g. (70–73 per cent of the theoretical amount) boiling at 183–185° and melting at 25–26°.
A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, reflux condenser protected from moisture by a calcium chloride-filled drying tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel that is connected to a nitrogen flow line and is charged with a solution of 97% di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (14.3 g, 63.6 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (100 mL,). Methyl serinate hydrochloride (10.0 g, 64.3 mmol) is placed in the flask and suspended in tetrahydrofuran (200 mL) and 99% triethylamine (14.0 g, 138 mmol,). The resulting white suspension is cooled with an ice-water bath and the solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate is added dropwise over a period of 1 hr. After 10 min of additional stirring, the ice-water bath is removed and the suspension is stirred overnight (14 hr) at room temperature, then warmed at 50°C for a further 3 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is partitioned between diethyl ether (200 mL) and saturated aqueous bicarbonate solution (250 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with three 150-mL portions of diethyl ether . The combined organic phases are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 13.4-14.0 g (95-99% crude yield) of N-Boc-L-serine methyl ester as a colorless oil that is used without further purification.
A. N,N-Dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, and a three-way stopcock fitted with a drying tube containing anhydrous calcium chloride and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with 50 mL of dichloromethane and 3.07 (0.042 mol) of N,N-dimethylformamide added through the septum from a syringe, and cooled in an ice bath. To the cooled mixture is slowly added 5.23 mL (0.06 mol) of oxalyl chloride by means of a syringe. The addition is accompanied by gas evolution and formation of a white precipitate. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional hour at 0°C. Excess oxalyl chloride and solvent are removed under reduced pressure by first using a water aspirator and then a rotary pump at room temperature through the drying tube. The white solid remaining in the flask is N,N-dimethylchloromethylenammonium chloride, which is used directly in Part B.
In a 1-l. distilling flask, fitted with a thermometer reaching within 5 mm. of the bottom, is placed an intimate mixture of 200 g. (1.34 moles) of powdered adipic acid and 10 g. of finely ground crystallized barium hydroxide. The mixture is gradually heated in a fusible alloy bath to 285–295° during about one and one-half hours, and maintained at that temperature until only a small amount of dry residue remains in the flask. This requires about two hours longer. The cyclopentanone distils slowly, accompanied by small quantities of adipic acid.
B. cis-Bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-3,7-dione. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a heating mantle, two reflux condensers, and a magnetic stirrer is charged with 135 g (0.364 mol) of the tetraester, 66 mL of glacial acetic acid, and 600 mL of 1 M hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred vigorously and heated at reflux for 2.5 hr. The solution is cooled in an ice bath and the product is extracted with five 250-mL portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined, and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature at or below 40°C) until most of the acetic acid is removed. The residue is dissolved in 300 mL of fresh chloroform. The solution is washed with 60-mL portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate until the aqueous layer remains basic to litmus paper, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated cautiously under reduced pressure. The yield is 44–45.5 g (88–90%) of white to light yellow solid, mp 84–85°C. The product is sufficiently pure for most purposes; it may be purified by recrystallization from methanol or ethanol and/or by sublimation at 70°C (0.1 mm).
The residue is then placed in a modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. Dimethylacrylic acid distils at 100–106°/20 mm. The yield of white solid is 49–53 g. (49–53%). This product melts at 60–65°. It may be further purified by recrystallization from petroleum ether (b.p., 60–70°) or water.
(2R,5R)-1-{2-[(2R,5R)-2,5-dimethylphospholan-1-yl]phenyl}-2,5-dimethylphospholane 1-oxide (R,R)-BozPHOS. A flame-dried, 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with (R,R)-Me-DuPHOS (1 g, 3.26 mmol) in a glove-box under argon. Anhydrous THF (32 mL) is added to the flask via a syringe under argon and the resulting colorless solution is cooled in a 0 °C ice bath for 15 min before BH3·DMS 10 M (360 µL, 3.6 mmol) is added dropwise via a syringe. The colorless mixture is stirred for 45 min under argon at 0 °C and H2O2 35% wt. (3 × 1.15 mL, 39.2 mmol) is added dropwise via syringe at 0 °C under argon in three portions with an interval of 30 min between each addition. The mixture is stirred for an additional 45 min at room temperature, and the reaction is quenched by the dropwise addition via cannula of a saturated aqueous solution of Na2SO3 (40 mL) at 0 °C over 30 min. The mixture is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel and the aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL), and the combined extracts are dried over Na2SO4 (50 g), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 50 mmHg) to afford a white foam (1.115 g). The crude product and DABCO (550 mg, 4.9 mmol) are placed in a 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum. The flask is purged under argon, then anhydrous benzene (32 mL) is added. The colorless reaction mixture is stirred for 5 h in a 50 °C oil bath and then the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 40 mmHg) to afford a white residue. The crude product is purified on silica gel to afford 977 mg (93% yield, >99% ee) of the title compound as a white solid.
The apparatus is assembled as indicated and the oil baths under B and D are heated to about 190–200°, and the oil bath under F to about 110–120°. The bath under I is filled with ice. The volatile products are collected in I which is kept carefully protected from light. When the reaction is well started 300 g. of dry glycerol is placed in each separatory funnel, and added drop by drop during the heating. After the first violent reaction has abated (about one hour) the baths under B and D are raised to 215–230° and maintained there until no more volatile product comes over (a total time of heating of about four and one-half hours). After B and D have been heated about four hours the ice under I is replaced by water which is heated to 75–80° to distil the acrolein into flask M, which is packed in ice. Near the end of the distillation the water under I is heated to boiling.
A. Malonyl dichloride. In a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask fitted by a ground-glass joint to a reflux condenser capped with a calcium chloride drying tube are placed 52 g. (0.5 mole) of finely powered, dry malonic acid and 120 ml. (about 1.65 mole) of thionyl chloride. The flask is warmed for 3 days in a heating bath kept at 45–50°. During this period the mixture, which is agitated occasionally by gentle swirling, gradually darkens to a deep brownish red or sometimes a blue color. Finally the mixture is heated at 60° for 5–6 hours. After cooling, it is transferred to a 125-ml. modified Claisen flask and distilled at reduced pressure (water aspirator). A calcium chloride guard tube is inserted between the vacuum line and the apparatus, and the flask is heated with a bath rather than a free flame. After a small fore-run of thionyl chloride, the malonyl chloride distils at 58–60°/28 mm. The pale yellow product amounts to 50.5–60 g. (72–85% yield), nD29 1.4572.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask attached to a reflux condenser are placed 60 g. (58.5 ml., 0.5 mole) of acetophenone, 52.7 g. (0.65 mole) of dimethylamine hydrochloride, and 19.8 g. (0.22 mole) of paraformaldehyde. After the addition of 1 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in 80 ml. of 95% ethanol, the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for 2 hours. The yellowish solution is filtered, if it is not clear and, and is transferred to a 1-l. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask. While still warm, it is diluted by the addition of 400 ml. of acetone, allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, and then chilled overnight in the refrigerator. The large crystals are filtered and washed with 25 ml. of acetone. After it has been dried for 2.5 hours at 40–50°, this crude product weighs 72–77 g. (68–72%) and melts at 138–141° and; it is suitable for many reactions.
The crude substance is dissolved in 1.2 l. of boiling water, filtered with suction, and allowed to cool. The crystals are filtered, washed with water, and dried. There is obtained 48–55 g. of product (32–36 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the amount of crude ricinoleic acid taken for oxidation). The melting point of the purified azelaic acid is 104–106°.
The temperature is kept at 60–65°, and 630 g. (473 cc., 5 moles) of "practical" methyl sulfate is added gradually through the separatory funnel. The rate of addition is such that the methyl iodide distils briskly; the addition requires about two hours.
On redistillation under reduced pressure there is obtained 220–240 g. (52–57 per cent of the theoretical amount) of reddish yellow bromal, boiling at 59–62°/9 mm., or 71–74°/18 mm.
After all the sodium has dissolved, a mixture of 115 g. (0.72 mole) of diethyl malonate and 60 g. (0.60 mole) of methyl crotonate is added from the separatory funnel. This addition is made as rapidly as is consistent with keeping the exothermic reaction under control. After the exothermic reaction has subsided, the mixture is heated for 1 hour under reflux with stirring. An oil bath is recommended for heating. At the end of the heating period the condenser is changed to a position for distilling, and the temperature of the oil bath is raised sufficiently to distil alcohol fairly rapidly from the stirred mixture. Distillation is continued until most of the alcohol has been distilled. There is left a residue of the sodio derivative of triethyl 2-methyl-1,1,3-propanetricarboxylate. If water is added to obtain the free ester, considerable heat is generated and cooling must be adequate to prevent partial hydrolysis of the ester by the alkali liberated. For present purposes there is no advantage in attempting isolation of the ester, and the residue is processed as described below.
A. Iodotrimethylsilane. A 250-ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, an addition funnel for solids, and a reflux condenser bearing a nitrogen inlet is charged with 5.6 g. (0.21 mole) of aluminum powder and 16.2 g. (0.100 mole) of hexamethyldisiloxane and purged with nitrogen. The mixture is stirred and heated with an oil bath at 60° as 50.8 g. (0.200 mole) of iodine is added slowly through the addition funnel over 55 minutes. The bath temperature is raised to ca. 140°, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 1.5 hours. The reflux condenser is removed, and the flask is equipped for distillation at atmospheric pressure. The bath temperature is gradually raised from 140° to 210°, and the clear, colorless distillate is collected, yielding 32.6–35.3 g. (82–88%) of iodotrimethylsilane, b.p. 106–109° and.
(S)-(−)-2-Bromo-3-hydroxypropanoic acid . L-Serine (52.5 g, 0.5 mol) and potassium bromide, KBr, (200 g, 1.7 mol) are dissolved in water (400 mL). Hydrobromic acid (48%,123 mL, 1.09 mol) is added at room temperature and the mixture is cooled to −13°C with stirring. Nitrogen, N2, is bubbled through the solution and sodium nitrite (42.8 g, 0.62 mol) is slowly added in small portions (ca. 5 g every 15 min). After each addition, the reaction mixture turns brown and then the color slowly fades, but the solution does not decolorize entirely. The total time required for addition of all the sodium nitrite is approximately 2.5 hr. The solution is then allowed to warm to 0°C, the N2 purge is stopped, and the mixture is stirred for 6 hr. Excess nitrogen oxides are removed by bubbling N2 through the solution for 1 hr. The pale green solution is then extracted with ether (6 × 300 mL). The combined organic extracts are concentrated to 0.5 L by rotary evaporation and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After filtration, the ether is evaporated and the residual solvent is removed under reduced pressure (0.1 mm). The pale yellow or green oil (74-75 g, 87-89%) is used immediately in the next reaction without purification,,.
A. Methyl desoxycholate. To a cooled solution of 100 g. (0.255 mole) of desoxycholic acid in 1 l. of methanol is added carefully 50 ml. of acetyl chloride. The solution is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature and is then diluted with cold water until just turbid. Crystallization is induced by scratching and seeding, if necessary. When much of the ester has crystallized, the mixture is further diluted to about 2.5 l. and allowed to stand for 30 minutes until crystallization is complete. The ester is collected on a filter, washed with water, and dried. The yield is 100–103 g. (97–100%) of material which melts at 95–100°.
B. 2-Acetyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with a solution of 29.2–30 g. (ca. 0.1 mole) of crude 2-acetyl-2-phenylselenocyclohexanone in 100 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred at room temperature, and a 2–3 ml. portion from a solution of 23.8 g. of 30% hydrogen peroxide (7.14 g., 0.21 mole) in 20 ml. of water is added to initiate the oxidation (Caution!). After the exothermic reaction begins, the mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice–salt bath as necessary to keep the temperature between 30 and 35° while the remainder of the hydrogen peroxide solution is added. When the oxidation is complete, the ice–salt bath is removed, and vigorous stirring is continued for 15 minutes at room temperature and 15 minutes at 0°. The chilled suspension of benzeneseleninic acid is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane layer from the filtrate is washed with 50 ml. of aqueous 7% sodium hydrogen carbonate, dried by filtration through a cone of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated, providing 12.8–13.7 g. of crude product. Distillation in carefully washed glassware at 0.1 mm. using a Kügelrohr apparatus with an oven temperature of 50–55° gives 11.0–11.9 g. (79–85%) of 2-acetyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one.
With minor modifications, this method is suitable for the preparation of ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl, n-amyl, isobutyl, and isoamyl iodides with yields of more than 90 per cent. A somewhat lower yield is obtained in the preparation of sec.-butyl iodide owing to the formation of hydrogen iodide.
After this time the excess hydrobromic acid is neutralized with excess sodium carbonate, of which about 100 g. of anhydrous salt is required. To the aqueous solution is then added about 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate until some of the solid does not dissolve. A layer of ethylene bromohydrin separates and is collected in 200 cc. of ether. The ether layer is below the aqueous layer. The solid sodium sulfate is filtered from the solution and washed once or twice with a small amount of ether to remove any mechanically held bromohydrin. The aqueous filtrate is twice extracted with 200-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried overnight with anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and distilled from a steam bath. The remaining bromohydrin is distilled under reduced pressure. After two distillations the fraction boiling at 55–59°/22 mm. is pure ethylene bromohydrin. The yield is 327–345 g. (87–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The alcohol, water, and unreacted oxime are removed by heating the acid distillate on the steam cone under reduced pressure (about 20–30 mm.); the amine hydrochloride crystallizes in the flask. The flask is then cooled and equipped with a reflux condenser through which 1 l. of 40 per cent potassium hydroxide solution is introduced. The hydrochloride is washed down from the sides of the flask, and the resulting mixture is cooled and transferred to a separatory funnel. The lower alkaline layer is removed and solid potassium hydroxide is added to the amine in the funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and fresh sticks of potassium hydroxide are added from time to time until no further separation of an aqueous alkaline solution occurs. Twenty-four to thirty hours is required for complete drying. The amine is then decanted through the top of the funnel into a 250-cc. modified Claisen flask and distilled. The n-heptylamine is collected at 152–157°. The yield is 140–170 g. (60–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A solution of 83.5 g. (0.50 mole) of ethyl bromoacetate and 65 g. (0.61 mole) of benzaldehyde in 80 ml. of dry benzene and 20 ml. of absolute ether is placed in the separatory funnel. About 10 ml. of this solution is added to the zinc, and the flask is warmed until the reaction starts. The mixture is then stirred and the rest of the solution added at such a rate that the reaction mixture refluxes, care being taken that the reaction does not become too vigorous. The addition should take about an hour. The reaction mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes on a water bath after the addition of the solution is complete.
In the 250-ml. flask 100 g. (0.78 mole) of freshly vacuum-distilled ethyl acetoacetate and 0.05 g. of sodium bicarbonate are placed and heated so that the toluene is kept just boiling until the liquid in the flask has reached 200–210°. The time for heating is usually 7–8 hours, during which period 27 g. of distillate boiling at 72° (mostly ethanol) is collected, and the color of the reaction mixture becomes dark brown. The dehydroacetic acid, while still hot, is transferred to a 200-ml. distilling flask and distilled under reduced pressure. After a fore-run boiling up to 128° at 12 mm., consisting of ethyl acetoacetate, has been collected, the receiver is changed and dehydroacetic acid is collected up to 140°/12 mm. The yield of dehydroacetic acid melting at 104–110° is 34 g. (53%). A purer product, m.p. 108°, may be secured in 80% yield by recrystallization from ethanol, using 2 ml. per gram of material.
A mixture of 63 g. (0.25 mole) of crystallized copper sulfate, 20 g. (0.31 atom) of copper turnings, 154 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium bromide dihydrate, 30 g. (16.3 cc., 0.28 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84), and 1 l. of water is refluxed over a flame for three to four hours until the color becomes yellowish.
A. 1-Phenyl-3-butyn-1-ol (1). A 1000-mL, oven-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar and pressure-equalizing addition funnel, fitted with a rubber septum, and placed under an argon atmosphere. The flask is charged with lithium acetylide-ethylenediamine complex (50 g, 543 mmol), which is dissolved in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide (360 mL) with stirring. The flask is placed in a room temperature water bath, the addition funnel is charged with styrene oxide (42.0 mL, 368 mmol), and styrene oxide is added dropwise over a period of approximately 5 min. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr and quenched by pouring slowly into 600 mL of ice water in a 4-L beaker. The contents are transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and the mixture is extracted with diethyl ether (6 × 350 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed once with water and decanted with evaporation of solvents by rotary evaporation. The crude product is purified by vacuum distillation. Any remaining traces of solvent and water distill over first, followed by the product (88-89°C, 1.0 mm) to provide 1-phenyl-3-butyn-1-ol (1, 43.98 g, 82% yield) as a colorless oil.
Filtrate A is concentrated to approximately 200 ml. and added to Filtrate C. The resulting mixture is well agitated and filtered through a 25-cm. Büchner funnel. The residue is extracted twice in a similar manner with 500 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) benzene–ether. All the filtrates are now combined in the original 12-l. reaction vessel and washed successively with two 500-ml. portions of water, two 500-ml. portions of cold (0°), 2 N hydrochloric acid, and three 500 ml portions of water. The organic layer is dried for 2 hours over ca. 110 g. of magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness, yielding approximately 16 g. of crude product.
In a 12-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a short reflux condenser are placed 1800 g. (32.2 atoms) of iron filings, 3 l. (52.5 moles) of glacial acetic acid, 3 l. of water, and 450 g. (3.95 moles) of heptaldehyde. The mixture is heated on the steam bath, with stirring, for six to seven hours. The flask is then fitted to an apparatus for steam distillation (p. 479) and the mixture distilled in a current of steam until no more oil passes over (7–8 l. of distillate). The oil is then separated, and the aqueous part distilled to recover a small quantity of dissolved or suspended heptyl alcohol.
B. Acenaphthenol. The acetate obtained as above is dissolved in 275 ml. of methanol in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and a solution of 40 g. (1.2 equiv.) of sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of water is added. This mixture is refluxed for 2 hours and then cooled below 20°. The yellow crystalline acenaphthenol is collected on a filter and washed well with about 1.5 l. of water. The crude product is air-dried (138–143 g.) and then dissolved in 2 l. of boiling benzene. The solution is treated with 6–8 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtered through a heated funnel. The orange-red filtrate is concentrated to about 1 l., and the acenaphthenol is allowed to crystallize. After filtering with suction and washing with cold benzene (about 500 ml.) until the wash solvent is colorless, the acenaphthenol is obtained as practically colorless needles, m.p. 144.5–145.5° (cor.). It weighs 117–121 g. From the filtrate may be obtained an additional quantity of material which on one recrystallization gives only 3–5 g. of pure acenaphthenol. The total yield amounts to 120–126 g. (70–74% based on the acenaphthene).
A 1-L, three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet adapter, and pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 151 g (0.58 mol) of triphenylphosphine and 350 mL of dichloromethane. The mixture is cooled with an ice-salt bath to −5°C, and maintained under an argon atmosphere.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 100 g. (0.14 mole) of pure trimyristin (p. 538) and 200 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for two hours, with frequent shaking or stirring until the trimyristin has become emulsified. It is then diluted with 300 cc. of water and the heating is continued for another one-half hour, by which time the solution should be almost clear, indicating complete saponification. The solution is now poured with stirring into a hot solution of 650 cc. of water and 100 cc. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid. The free acid which separates is not entirely clear, owing to the presence of unchanged sodium salt. A gentle current of steam is passed into the hot mixture until the oily layer is transparent; this requires about fifteen minutes. The acid is allowed to cool and solidify; it is removed and freed of small quantities of salt and water by filtering through paper in a steam-jacketed funnel. The yield is 84–90 g. (89–95 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless product which melts at 52–53°.
Into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask containing 50 g. (0.44 mole) of 2-ketohexamethylenimine (ε-caprolactam) is poured a solution containing 45 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) dissolved in 150 ml. of water. The mixture is boiled for 1 hour, and the resulting yellow solution is decolorized with Norit and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a steam bath.
C. (S,S)-( + )-1,4-Bis (dimethylamino)-2,3-dimethoxybutane (DDB). A 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a heating jacket, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser with drying tube, and a stoppered, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, flushed with nitrogen or argon, and charged with 2.2 L of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF,) and 60 g (1.6 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4,). A mixture of 250 mL of THF and 232 g (1.0 mol) of the diamide is added, with stirring, at a rate sufficient to reach and maintain refluxing. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is kept boiling for 2 hr. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and 60 mL of water, 180 mL of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide, and again 60 mL of water are added cautiously with very vigorous stirring. The hydrogen gas that is generated is led well above the stirring motor into the hood exhaust. Temporarily, the slurry becomes viscous and difficult to stir; during this period addition has to be made extremely carefully. The pale yellow, completely hydrolyzed slurry is filtered by suction, the filter cake extracted twice by refluxing with THF in a round-bottomed flask, and the combined solutions are concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column; bp 62–64°C (3 mm), yield 180 g (88%). For use in organometallic reactions, DDB is freshly distilled from LiAlH4, [α]D + 14.7° (neat), d420 0.896.
After the first run, 400 g. of chloroform and enough absolute alcohol (800–1000 cc.) are added to the recovered chloroform-alcohol mixture to give a total volume of 3 l. The sodium is then added as before. After the excess of chloroform and alcohol has been distilled through the fractionating column, the intermediate fraction from the previous run is added before fractionating. The yield from such a run is about 200 g. (45 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
A. (2-Bromoallyl)diisopropoxyborane. A flame-dried, 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, 125-mL dropping funnel, and an Allihn-type condenser. To the top of the condenser, a 3-L bag, water aspirator through a calcium chloride tube, and allene gas cylinder are connected with two three-way stopcocks as shown in Figure 1. The flask and the bag are evacuated twice using a water aspirator, and filled with allene gas each time. The stopcock between the bag and the reaction flask is closed off, and the flask is cooled to −20°C in a cooling bath made of dry ice and a 9 : 1 mixture of ethylene glycol and acetone . Boron tribromide, BBr3 (25 g, 9.4 mL, 100 mmol) is introduced through the rubber septum via cannula. The stopcock separating the bag from the reaction vessel is then opened. Gas absorption starts immediately and is complete within 10 min to give a dark red solution. When the allene is completely consumed, the gas cylinder is replaced by a nitrogen inlet tube and nitrogen is introduced into the flask. The mixture is stirred at −20°C for 30 min and then 30 mL of dry dichloromethane is added. Next, 33 mL (0.23 mol) of diisopropyl ether in 50 mL of dry dichloromethane is introduced from the dropping funnel over 1 hr (exothermic!). The mixture is stirred at −20°C for 30 min, then at room temperature for 2 hr, and finally under reflux for 1 hr. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and all volatile components are removed under reduced pressure using a water aspirator. The vessel is filled with nitrogen, and the residue is transferred to a distillation flask via a cannula using nitrogen. Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 16.4-17.1 g (66-69%) of (2-bromoallyl)diisopropoxyborane as a clear liquid, bp 39-43°C (0.4 mm),(Note 10),(Note 11),(Note 12).
B. (S)-(−)-Citronellol. Geraniol (12.9 mL, 74 mmol) and 95% methanol (15 mL) are placed in a dry, 80-mL Schlenk tube and the mixture is degassed by five freeze-thaw cycles. Another dry, 80-mL Schlenk tube, equipped with a rubber septum and a magnetic stirring bar and filled with argon, is charged with Ru(OCOCH3)2 [(R)-BINAP] (45 mg, 53 μmol). The system is evacuated and refilled with argon three times. By use of a cannula, the solution of geraniol in methanol is introduced into the Schlenk tube containing the ruthenium complex under argon. The resulting light yellow solution is then transferred with a cannula into a 100-mL, stainless steel autoclave equipped with a glass vessel and a magnetic stirring bar by use of a slight positive pressure of argon. The autoclave is connected to a hydrogen source using the arrangement shown in Figure 1, and the air originally present in the gas-inlet tube is replaced by hydrogen. Valve A is opened and hydrogen is introduced until pressure gauge B indicates 100 atm. The solution is stirred at 20°C for 8–16 hr. During hydrogenation, the hydrogen pressure is kept above 90 atm by the occasional introduction of hydrogen from the cylinder. When consumption of hydrogen ceases, the gas-inlet tube is disconnected. Excess hydrogen is carefully released by opening valve A and then the apparatus is disassembled. The yellowish brown contents are transferred to a 50-mL flask and the solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 10.7–11.2 g (93–97% yield) of (S)-(−)-citronellol in 98% ee and; bp 58–62°C/0.01 mm.
B. (S)-1,1-Diphenylprolinol. A 3-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, 1-L addition funnel and Teflon-coated thermocouple probe, is charged with phenylmagnesium chloride (0.80 L, 1.6 mol, 2.0 M in tetrahydrofuran) and cooled to −10°C. To the suspension is added, with stirring, the tetrahydrofuran solution of (S)-proline-N-carboxyanhydride over a 1-hr period maintaining the temperature at −15° to −10°C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is aged for 3 hr at −15°C, then 1 hr at 0°C. The reaction is quenched into a 5-L, mechanically-stirred flask containing 2 M aqueous sulfuric acid (1.05 L, 2.1 mol) (0°C) over a 0.5–1.0 hr period. The reaction mixture is aged for 1 hr at 0–5°C, filtered, and the magnesium sulfate cake washed with tetrahydrofuran (3 × 500 mL). The filtrate and tetrahydrofuran washes are combined and concentrated (1 atm) to a volume of 1.0 L. The mixture is cooled to 0°C, aged 1 hr, and then filtered. The cake is washed with water (5°C, 2 × 100 mL) and ethyl acetate (3 × 180 mL). The cake is dried under reduced pressure (40°C, 50 mBar) to yield 79–88 g (50–56% based on proline) of (S)-diphenylprolinol sulfate as a free-flowing white crystalline solid, mp 275–290°C.
When the permanganate has been destroyed, the stirrer is stopped and the manganese dioxide allowed to coagulate for one hour. The mixture is filtered through two 20-cm. Büchner funnels; the filter cakes are washed with 1000 cc. of water and sucked dry again. The filtrate is evaporated to 800–1000 cc. over a free flame. While the volume of solution is large, two 30-cm. evaporating dishes are used, but toward the end the two solutions are combined in one dish. The evaporation requires two to three hours. Sometimes a little manganese dioxide will be coagulated during the evaporation; this should be removed by filtration.
The reaction mixture is transferred to an ice-cold 2-l. separatory funnel, and the yellow-green methylene chloride layer is run into 1 l. of cold 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 75 ml. of methylene chloride. The methylene chloride and sodium bicarbonate solutions are returned to the separatory funnel and shaken until no trace of acid remains, as shown by indicator paper. The golden yellow organic layer is separated, transferred to a dry separatory funnel, and shaken for 5 minutes with 15 g. of granular anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried ethyl diazoacetate solution is filtered through a cotton plug inserted in the separatory funnel stem, and the bulk of the solvent is distilled through an efficient column at a pressure of about 350 mm.. The last traces of solvent are removed at a pressure of 20 mm. and a maximum pot temperature of 35°. The yield is 90–100 g. (79–88%) of yellow oil, nD25 1.462. This product is pure enough for most synthetic work and.
The porridge-like mixture is then poured into 300 ml. of water and vigorously shaken in a 1-l. separatory funnel. The benzene phase is separated, and the water phase is extracted three times with 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are washed until neutral and are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The volatile solvents are evaporated at aspirator pressure, and the residue is distilled through a short Vigreux column. After a fore-run of diethyl ethylmalonate 23.3–24.1 g. (75–78%) of diethyl [O-benzoyl]ethyltartronate is obtained, b.p. 132° (0.1 mm.); n20D 1.4885.
A. 4,5-Dihydro-2-(2-propenylthio)thiazole. A solution of 11.9 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-mercapto-2-thiazoline in 60 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is prepared in a 200-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 25-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. Allyl bromide (12.1 g., 8.74 ml., 0.100 mole) is added in one portion at room temperature, and 5 minutes later 10.1 g. (13.9 ml., 0.100 mole) of triethylamine is added dropwise over a 10-minute period. After the dropping funnel has been replaced with a condenser, the mixture is refluxed gently for 4 hours. The resulting slurry is cooled and filtered, removing triethylamine hydrobromide, which is washed with 20 ml. of fresh tetrahydrofuran, and the combined organic solutions are concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of diethyl ether, and this solution is washed with three 20-ml. portions of 5% aqueous potassium hydroxide and two 20-ml. portions of water. After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the ethereal solution is filtered and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Vacuum distillation of the residue gives 10.9–11.1 g. (69–70%) of 4,5-dihydro-2-(2-propenylthio)thiazole, b.p. 51–54° (0.02 mm., bath temperature 75–80°,); nD20 1.5864.
The precipitated 2-amino-5-bromopyridine, contaminated with some 2-amino-3,5-dibromopyridine, is collected by filtration and, after washing with water until the washings are free of ionic bromide, is dried at 110°. The 2-amino-3,5-dibromopyridine is removed from the product by washing with three 500-ml. portions of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°). The yield of 2-amino-5-bromopyridine, m.p. 132–135°, sufficiently pure for use in the next stage, is 320–347 g. (62–67%) and.
To the reaction mixture is added 660 g. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), and the suspension is boiled for 30 minutes. It is then filtered, while hot, through a Büchner funnel. The residual cake is boiled again, for the same length of time, with a mixture of 500 ml. of water and 30 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and then filtered as before.
(B) Ethyl 1-Methylthiol-3-phthalimidopropane-3,3-dicarboxylate.—A mixture of 85 g. (0.26 mole) of ethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate and 43 g. (0.39 mole) of β-chloroethyl methyl sulfide (p. 136) is heated in an oil bath at 160–165° in a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a condenser, a thermometer, and a stoppered glass tube for sampling. After one and a half to two hours the mixture is no longer alkaline to litmus. The excess chloroethyl methyl sulfide is distilled under reduced pressure, the residual oil is treated with 150 cc. of warm water, and the resulting mixture is transferred to a beaker and chilled. The crystalline material is filtered by suction, washed with 100 cc. of cold water, and recrystallized from the smallest possible quantity of warm absolute alcohol. In this way 75–79 g. (76–80 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a pure product, melting at 66–67°, is obtained.
A. Benzyl chloroformate. A 3-l. round-bottomed flask is fitted with a rubber stopper carrying an exit tube and a delivery tube extending to the bottom of the flask. The tubes are equipped with stopcocks so that the reaction flask may be disconnected. In the flask is placed 500 g. of dry toluene, and the apparatus is weighed. The flask is then cooled in an ice bath, and phosgene is bubbled into the toluene until 109 g. (1.1 moles) has been absorbed. The exit gases are passed through a flask containing toluene to remove any phosgene and then through a calcium chloride tube to a gas trap.
A solution of 50 g. (1 mole) of sodium cyanide (98% purity) in 100 ml. of water is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a ground-glass stopper. A solution of 58.9 g. (1.1 moles) of ammonium chloride in 140 ml. of lukewarm water is added, followed by 67 ml. (1 mole) of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.9). This mixture is stirred mechanically and is cooled by a stream of water while a solution of 86.1 g. (1 mole) of diethyl ketone in 160 ml. of methanol is added. The flask is then stoppered and half immersed for 5 hours in a water bath, the temperature of which is kept at 55–60°. The reaction mixture is then cooled in an ice bath and poured (with precautions, i.e., under a properly ventilated hood) into 800 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) contained in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask which is surrounded up to the neck by ice and water. The reaction flask is rinsed with two 25-ml. portions of water. The mixture is now saturated at 0–5° with hydrogen chloride gas. After standing overnight under a hood, the mixture is refluxed for 2.5 hours.
In the 250-mL flask is placed 100 mL of dicyclopentadiene. The material is heated at reflux (bath temperature 200–210°C) under a nitrogen atmosphere. After a 5-mL forerun is collected and discarded, the collection receiver is cooled to −78°C and 25 mL (0.30 mol) of cyclopentadiene is rapidly distilled at bp 36–42°C. A slight positive pressure of nitrogen is maintained throughout the distillation to prevent moisture from entering the system.
After the first ebullition has subsided, no further attention is required, and the mixture is heated to boiling over a ring burner until the solution becomes clear. The stirring should be continued during the refluxing, and the stirrer should be arranged so as to suck the liquid downward from the surface. This helps distribute the zinc which holds hydrogen and floats on top of the liquid. About four to seven hours are required for the heating. The thiophenol is then distilled with steam, this process requiring about one hour. The product is separated from the water, dried with calcium chloride (shaking with calcium chloride for three to five minutes is generally sufficient), and distilled. The crude material weighs 359 g. (96 per cent of the theoretical amount), and the pure compound boiling at 166–169° (71°/15mm.) weighs 340 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount). Ten to twelve hours are required for the whole experiment up to the final distillation.
A suspension of 35 g. (0.153 mole) of 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone in 77 ml. of acetic anhydride is treated with 0.5 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The hydroquinone goes into solution immediately with the evolution of much heat. The dark-colored solution is allowed to stand at room temperature overnight; then it is poured into 400 ml. of water. The acetylated material is collected by suction filtration and dried. The crude 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone diacetate is distilled at reduced pressure (b.p. 236–241°/1 mm. or 182–190°/0.1 mm.), and the hot distillate is poured into 20 ml. of n-butyl alcohol. The product immediately separates as a colorless, crystalline mass, which is collected by suction filtration and dried. The yield is 32–35 g. (67–73%), m.p. 104–105°.
C. 3-Chloroindazole. In a 200-ml. flask connected by a glass joint to an air condenser protected by a drying tube are placed 26.8 g. (0.2 mole) of dry indazolone and 15.8 g. (16 ml., 0.2 mole) of dry pyridine; 46.1 g. (27.6 ml., 0.3 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride is then added, with shaking, over a 10-minute period. Heat is evolved, and acid fumes are generated. The mixture is heated with occasional shaking in an oil bath, which is maintained at 128–130° for 1 hour and at 130–140° for 4 hours. The clear brown solution is then cooled to 70° and poured, with hand stirring, upon 500 g. of cracked ice. This mixture is allowed to stand for 24 hours. The pale buff solid is removed, washed on the filter, first with 100 ml. of 0.5 N hydrochloric acid and then with 40 ml. of cold water, and air-dried. The 3-chloroindazole is crystallized from 3 l. of 20% ethanol. The yield is 21–22.5 g. (68–74%) of material melting at 148–148.5°.
The mixture is shaken vigorously, the lower layer is separated and stored in ice, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two, 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined, organic extracts are shaken with 100 ml. of ice-cold, concentrated aqueous ammonia (35% w/w) filtered through a filter-aid cake, and separated. The extraction and filtration are repeated with fresh ammonia solution using the same filter. The filter is washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the organic layer is separated and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The dried solution is filtered, the filter is washed with 50 ml. of dichloromethane, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 30°. The flask containing the residual oil is cooled to 0° before exposure to air.
A. (4R)-(+)-Acetoxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A flame-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, is purged with nitrogen and charged with 1.0 L of dry dichloromethane, 1.5 g of anhydrous sodium acetate, 70 g of 4 Å molecular sieves, and 23 g (162 mmol) of (1R,4S)-(+)-4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate. Finely powdered pyridinium chlorochromate (50 g, 240 mmol) is added portionwise over a period of 5 min, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hr, then filtered through a pad of Florisil. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residual dark oil is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel with elution by 20% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether (bp 35–60°C) to give 18.9 g (83%) of (4R)-(+)-acetoxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one as a colorless oil.
B. (−)-(Camphorsulfonyl)imine. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2-in. egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, a Dean–Stark water separator, and a double-walled condenser containing a mineral oil bubbler connected to an inert gas source. Into the flask are placed 5 g of Amberlyst 15 ion-exchange resin and 41.5 g of the crude (+)-(1S)-camphorsulfonamide in 500 mL of toluene. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 4 hr. After the reaction flask is cooled, but while it is still warm (40–50°C), 200 mL of methylene chloride is slowly added to dissolve any (camphorsulfonyl)imine that crystallizes. The solution is filtered through a 150-mL sintered glass funnel of coarse porosity an the reaction flask and filter funnel are washed with an additional 75 mL of methylene chloride.
To a mixture of 120 g. (118.5 ml., 1 mole) of acetophenone, 123 g. (109 ml., 1 mole) of ethyl chloroacetate, and 200 ml. of dry benzene in a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer and low-temperature thermometer, is added, over a period of 2 hours, 47.2 g. (1.2 moles) of finely pulverized sodium amide. The temperature is kept at 15–20° by external cooling. After the addition has been completed, the mixture is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature, and the reddish mixture is poured upon 700 g. of cracked ice, with hand stirring. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 200 ml. of benzene. The combined benzene solutions are washed with three 300-ml. portions of water, the last one containing 10 ml. of acetic acid. The benzene solution is dried over 25 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, the drying agent rinsed with a little dry benzene, and, after removal of the solvent, the residue is fractionated under reduced pressure, using a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 107–113°/3 mm. is collected separately and used for the preparation of hydratropaldehyde (p. 733). Redistillation yields a product which boils at 111–114°/3 mm.. The yield is 128–132 g. (62–64%).
The mixture is diluted with about 4 l. of water and is permitted to stand overnight. A small quantity of oily or solid impurity (benzohydrol) is removed by filtration, and dilute sulfuric acid (about 1300 cc. of a solution of 3 parts of water and 1 part of concentrated sulfuric acid, sp. gr. 1.84) is added to a point short of liberation of bromine. The product is filtered, washed with water and dried. Thus 450–484 g. (84–90 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzaldehyde) of benzilic acid melting at 149–150° is obtained.
C. 1-Phenylcyclopentanecarboxyaldehyde. The crude tetrahydroöxazine (25.0 g., 0.0916 mole) from Part B is heated at reflux with 300 ml. of water containing 37.8 g. (0.300 mole) of oxalic acid dihydrate for 3 hours. The solution is cooled, and the aldehyde is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°). The organic extracts are combined, washed with 10 ml. of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate, and dried with anhydrous powdered magnesium sulfate. The petroleum ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the product is distilled through a Vigreux column, giving 7.8–8.7 g. (50–55%) of 1-phenylcyclopentanecarboxaldehyde, b.p. 70–73° (0.1 mm.) nD26.5 1.5350, IR spectrum (neat) 1720 cm.−1 (C=O).
D. (1R,6S,7S)-4-(tert-Butyldimethylsiloxy)-6-(trimethylsilyl)bicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-4-en-2-one (4). A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet/outlet adapter, is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 2.81 mL (2.17 g, 21.4 mmol) of diisopropylamine and 20 mL of dry THF. The solution is stirred and cooled with an ice-water bath while 13.7 mL (20.1 mmol) of a 1.47 M hexane solution of BuLi is added dropwise via a syringe over 5 min. After 10 min, the mixture is cooled to −80°C with a hexane-liquid nitrogen bath, and a solution of 2.58 mL (2.49 g, 20.1 mmol) of 1-acetyl-1-cyclohexene in 20 mL of dry THF is added dropwise via a stainless steel cannula over 15 min. The mixture is then stirred at the same temperature for an additional 30 min, and the solution is maintained at −80°C.
Three hundred grams of β-naphthol (2.1 moles) is converted into nitroso-β-naphthol (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 411), and the product is transferred to a 6-l. (1.5 gal.) crock which is wide enough to admit the Büchner funnel (30-cm.) employed. A cold solution of 600 g. (5.8 moles) of sodium bisulfite and 100 cc. of 6 N sodium hydroxide solution in 2 l. of water is used to rinse the material adhering to the funnel into the crock. The mixture is diluted with water to 4–4.5 l. and stirred until solution of the nitroso-β-naphthol is complete (about fifteen minutes). The dark solution is siphoned onto a large Büchner funnel and filtered by suction, thus removing a small amount of tarry material which is always present. The clear, yellowish brown filtrate is transferred to an 8- to 10-l. wide-mouthed bottle and diluted with water to 7 l. While the solution is vigorously stirred, 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is poured slowly down the walls of the bottle; the mixture is then placed in the hood and protected from the light. The temperature rises from 20–25° to 35–40° at once and to about 50° in the course of two hours, when the reaction is nearly complete. After standing for a total of five hours or more, the precipitate, which sets to a stiff paste in the bottle, is collected on a filter. The residue is transferred to a 1-l. beaker and washed with 200 cc. of water. The mixture is filtered, and the residue is washed with 300 cc. of water on the filter. The moist material weighs 700–800 g. No appreciable decomposition takes place on drying the product to constant weight at 120°. A light powder of fine, gray needles is thus obtained. The yield is 410–420 g. (82–84 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the β-naphthol used).
B. Methyl 2-(diethylphosphoryloxy)-1-cyclohexene-1-carboxylate. A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a gas inlet tube connected to a nitrogen source and a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 1.58 g (0.0329 mol) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil. The sodium hydride is freed from the mineral oil by washing with four 40-mL portions of anhydrous diethyl ether and withdrawing the supernatant solvent with a syringe, after which 120 mL of anhydrous ether is added. The mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice bath as 4.68 g (0.0300 mol) of methyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate in 10 mL of ether is added at a moderately rapid rate such that vigorous but controlled evolution of hydrogen occurs. The resulting creamy suspension is stirred at 0°C for another 30 min, after which time 4.5 mL (5.37 g, 0.031 mol) of diethyl chlorophosphate is injected through the septum with a syringe. The ice bath is removed, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 3 hr, and 0.6 g of solid ammonium chloride is added. Stirring is continued for 30 min, and the salts are then separated by suction filtration through a medium porosity fritted-glass funnel. Concentration of the filtrate under reduced pressure affords 8.18–8.63 g of the enol phosphate that is used in Step C without purification.
The excess methanol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure (water pump) from a steam bath, and the residual liquid is poured into an 18- to 25-cm. evaporating dish which is cooled in a shallow pan of cold water. As the half ester crystallizes, it is stirred and scraped off the dish in order to prevent formation of a solid cake. After being dried to constant weight in a vacuum desiccator (5–8 days), the product weighs 502–507 g. (95–96%) and melts at 57–58° and.
The mixture is refluxed on an oil bath for eight hours with constant and vigorous stirring. After removing the oil bath, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to about 80°, while stirring is continued, and is then transferred to a separatory funnel previously heated to about the same temperature in an oven.
The alanine hydrochloride remaining in the flask is dissolved in 1500 cc. of water, and transferred to a metal pail of about 2-l. capacity. Two hundred and twenty grams of yellow lead oxide is added and the mixture is boiled gently for one hour. During the boiling small amounts of water are added at intervals in order to maintain the original volume. Upon cooling, the lead chloride crystallizes; it is filtered off and the solution is again boiled one hour with 100 g. of lead oxide. Twenty grams of freshly precipitated lead hydroxide is added slowly and the boiling is continued for ten minutes. Following this the solution is again cooled and filtered. The chloride content should now be equivalent to not more than 50–75 cc. of a normal solution.
B. Geranyl Diethyl Phosphate (2).To an argon-purged 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (round, with removable pivot ring, 40 mm length and 8 mm diameter), a rubber septum, and argon inlet is added geraniol (14.0 mL, 12.3 g, 80.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv), pyridine (16.1 mL, 15.8 g, 200 mmol, 2.5 equiv) and diethyl ether (60 mL) via syringe. The clear solution is cooled in a −30 °C dry ice-cooled acetone bath and stirred vigorously while diethyl chlorophosphate (17.4 mL, 20.7 g, 120 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added dropwise via syringe over the course of 10 min. Once the addition is complete, the reaction flask is removed from the cold bath (now −20 °C) and allowed to warm to 23 °C. Significant amounts of white precipitate appear as the reaction proceeds. After stirring for 6.5 h at 23 °C, the reaction is quenched by the addition of ice-cold 1 M NaOH (150 mL) over ~1 min (a slight exotherm occurs). The biphasic mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min, then transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted into EtOAc (3 × 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with 1 M HCl (2 × 150 mL), saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (150 mL) and brine (150 mL), and dried over MgSO4. The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration (medium-pore frit) and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 150 → 10 mmHg) and then under high vacuum (23 °C, 1 mmHg, 1 h). The crude yellow oil is pipetted onto a plug of packed silica gel (5 × 10 cm) and transferred quantitatively by adding CH2Cl2 washes (3 × 5 mL). The product is eluted with pressurized air directly into a 2-L round-bottomed flask with ice-cold hexanes (300 mL) followed by hexanes:EtOAc (2:3, 1.25 L). The bulk of the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 150 → 10 mmHg) and the resultant geranyl diethyl phosphate is transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked round-bottom flask and co-evaporated with dry toluene (3 × 15 mL; 30 °C, 10 mmHg) to remove both residual EtOAc and trace water.
In the flask are placed 70 g. (3 moles) of sodium and 200 cc. of dry toluene. The flask is heated in an oil bath until the sodium is melted. The stirrer is then started; when the sodium is finely divided, the oil bath is removed and the mixture allowed to cool. Stirring must be continued during the cooling in order to keep the sodium finely divided.
A. 1,2-Dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene. Caution! This step should be conducted in a hood to avoid exposure to ammonia fumes. A 5-l. three-necked flask, cooled in a dry ice-isopropyl alcohol bath, is fitted with an efficient stirrer and a dry ice condenser. The flask is charged with approximately 2.5 l. of liquid ammonia, the stirrer is started, and 450 g. of anhydrous diethyl ether, 460 g. (10 moles) of absolute ethanol, and 318.5 g. (3.0 moles) of o-xylene are added slowly in that order. Then 207 g. (9.0 g. atoms) of sodium is added in small pieces over a 5-hour period. The ammonia is allowed to evaporate overnight. The flask is now equipped with a reflux condenser, and approximately 800 ml. of ice water is slowly added with stirring to dissolve the salts. The two layers which form are separated and the upper organic layer is washed three times with 800-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The liquid is separated from the drying agent and is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 70–72° (48 mm.) is collected and weighs 250–300 g. (77–92%). The 1,2-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene is sufficiently pure for the epoxidation reaction.
The combined benzene filtrates from this initial washing procedure are concentrated under reduced pressure, and the washing procedure with benzene is repeated to give a second crop of the crude acid chloride which is transferred to a flask for recrystallization.
B. Methyl 2-(1-cyancyclohexyl)diaxenecarboxylate (2). A 5.5 M solution of bromine in dichloromethane is added dropwise to a vigorously stirred mixture of 19.1 g. (0.0970 mole) of hydrazine 1, 75 ml. of dichloromethane, 75 ml. of water, and 22 g. (0.26 mole) of sodium hydrogen carbonate in a 250-ml. flask, until a persistent, positive potassium iodide–starch paper test is obtained. Excess bromine is discharged with aqueous sodium sulfite, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 30 ml. of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated using a rotary evaporator, and distilled, yielding 17.3 g. (93%) of the diazene 2 as a clear, bright yellow oil, b.p. 95–97° (0.2 mm.).
The resulting acetoxime is now distilled in a current of steam, and the distillation is continued until a 5-cc. sample, shaken with 2 cc. of ether, yields no appreciable residue on evaporating the ether. To the distillate (2–2.5 l.) is added 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the acid solution is distilled at atmospheric pressure until the distillate is free of acetone. The residual liquor is then evaporated to dryness on the steam bath, either in an open dish or preferably under reduced pressure. The crude hydroxylamine hydrochloride so obtained, weighing 296–470 g. (49–77 per cent of the theoretical amount), is suitable for many purposes, but is best purified by recrystallization from half its weight of water. By systematic recrystallization of the product from several batches, the yield of pure product, which crystallizes in long flat needles, melting when dry at 150–154°, may be brought as high as 70 per cent of the theoretical amount.
In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser capped by a drying tube, are placed the dried anisyl chloride and, 73.6 g. (1.5 moles) of finely powdered sodium cyanide, 10 g. of sodium iodide, and 500 ml. of dry acetone. The heterogeneous reaction mixture is heated under reflux with vigorous stirring for 16–20 hours, then cooled and filtered with suction. The solid on the filter is washed with 200 ml. of acetone and discarded. The combined filtrates are distilled to remove the acetone. The residual oil is taken up in 300 ml. of benzene and washed with three 100-ml. portions of hot water. The benzene solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for about 15 minutes, and the solvent is removed by distillation at the reduced pressure of the water aspirator. The residual p-methoxyphenylacetonitrile is purified by distillation under reduced pressure through an 8-in. Vigreux column; b.p. 94–97°/0.3 mm.; nD25 1.5285–1.5291. The yield is 109–119 g., or 74–81% based on anisyl alcohol and.
C. 4-(3-Cyclohexenyl)-2-phenylthio-1-butene. To the above solution of the borane derivative, 0.809 g (0.700 mmol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0), 1.47 g (5.60 mmol) of triphenylphosphine, 35 mL of 3 M potassium phosphate in water, and finally 15.1 g (70.0 mmol) of 1-bromo-1-phenylthioethene are added and the resulting mixture is heated at reflux for 3 hr with stirring. The light brown solution is cooled to room temperature and treated with 6.4 g (100 mmol) of ethanolamine for 1 hr. Then 100 mL of hexane and 100 mL of water are added. The organic layer is separated, washed with 100 mL of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation. The addition of 250 mL of hexane to the residual viscous oil, containing some solid, precipitates the 9-BBN/ethanolamine complex. The solid is removed by filtration and is washed with hexane (50 mL × 3), and the filtrate is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude product is passed through a short silica gel column (60–200 mesh, 60 g) using hexane as an eluent. After removal of the hexane, the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 12.5–13.9 g (73–81%) of 4-(3-cyclohexenyl)-2-phenylthio-1-butene as a colorless liquid, bp 114–116°C (0.04 mm).
B. (S)-3-Amino-2-oxetanone p-toluenesulfonic acid salt.5 A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and an argon inlet adaptor. The flask is charged with a mixture of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-serine β-lactone (14.0 g, 74.8 mmol) and anhydrous p-toluenesulfonic acid (13.5 g, 78.5 mmol). The argon inlet adaptor is replaced with a rubber septum and an argon inlet and the flask is cooled in an ice bath for ca. 15 min. Anhydrous trifluoroacetic acid (200 mL,) is added by cannula along the sides of the flask over 20 min (stirring is initiated when possible). The pale yellow solution is stirred at 0°C for 10 min, the trifluoroacetic acid is removed on a rotary evaporator at below 30°C, and the resulting syrup is placed under high vacuum (~0.2 mm) for ca. 1 hr. Anhydrous ether (200 mL,) is added to the resulting solid, the mixture is triturated to break up lumps, and the suspension is filtered. The solid thus obtained is washed with ether (100 mL), air dried (5 min), and then dried under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) overnight to give 18.4 g (95% yield) of (S)-3-amino-2-oxetanone p-toluenesulfonic acid salt.
Dry air is blown through the solution to remove the excess of ammonia, and the solution is then dissolved in its own volume of absolute alcohol. A sample of this solution is titrated with standard oxalic acid, litmus being used as an outside indicator. The amount of oxalic acid necessary to form the acid salt is placed in a large evaporating dish and dissolved in 4 l. of 95 per cent alcohol. The amine solution is then slowly run into the acid with constant stirring. During the addition of the last half of the amine solution, the container must be cooled in order to avoid the formation of the neutral oxalate.
A. (E)-4-Dimethylamino-3-buten-2-one , 1.2 A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with acetylacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal (19.8 g, 0.15 mol), freshly distilled prior to use (67°C, 12 mm). A 2.0 M solution of dimethylamine in methanol (85 mL, 0.17 mol) is then added in one portion. The resulting yellow solution is stirred at room temperature for 4 hr, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The resulting oil is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (0.25 mm, oven temp 100-120°C) to afford 15.3 g (90%) of the desired vinylogous amide as a pale-orange oil.
C. (−)-(1S,4R)-Camphanoyl chloride. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for magnetic stirring and protected from moisture by a reflux condenser topped by a CaCl2 drying tube, is charged with 200 mL of thionyl chloride using a graduated cylinder. (−)-(1S,4R)-Camphanic acid (63.8 g, 0.322 mol) is added in portions using a powder funnel over 30 min, and the reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 3 hr, then allowed to cool to room temperature. Excess thionyl chloride is removed by rotary evaporation to afford a solid that is freed of any residual thionyl chloride by the addition of toluene (500 mL) and subsequent evaporation under reduced pressure (repeated three times). The resulting solids are dried under high vacuum to afford 69 g of (−)-(1S,4R)-camphanoyl chloride (99%) as an off-white solid, mp 69–71°C and.
B. 2-(1,3-Dibenzoyl-4-imidazolin-2-yl)imidazole hydrochloride.3 Into a 3-L beaker equipped with an air-driven stirrer are successively introduced 150 g (0.335 mol) of dry, unrecrystallized 1-benzoyl-2-(1,3-dibenzoyl-4-imidazolin-2-yl) imidazole, 500 mL of technical-grade methyl alcohol, and 30 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred as the solids gradually dissolve. After 1 hr a clear yellow solution results, which is allowed to stand for another 5 hr, during which time white solid product begins to precipitate. Technical diethyl ether (1500 mL) is next added, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. Filtration and rinsing of the crystals with fresh ether and ultimate air drying furnish 114–119 g (89–93%) of product, mp 238–239° C. Analytically pure material, obtained on recrystallizing a small sample from methyl alcohol-ether, has mp 240–241° C
D. Indazole. In a 300-ml. flask are placed 15.3 g. (0.1 mole) of 3-chloroindazole, 18.6 g. (0.15 mole) of red phosphorus, and 100 ml. of constant-boiling hydriodic acid (sp. gr. 1.7). The mixture is refluxed for 24 hours, cooled, and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel to remove the phosphorus; the flask and the solid are washed with two 20-ml. portions of water. The clear filtrate is transferred to a 300-ml. Claisen flask and concentrated to about 40 ml. by heating in a water bath at a reduced pressure. The residue is washed into a 250-ml. beaker with 70–80 ml. of hot water, and the clear solution is cooled in an ice bath and made strongly alkaline with concentrated ammonium hydroxide (about 80 ml. is required). The next day, the indazole is collected and dried; the white solid melts at 143–145°.
A mixture of 200 g. (1.9 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate and 300 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl bromomalonate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 245) is heated for three hours in a 1-l. flask immersed in an oil bath at 150–160°. After the heating period, 300 cc. of xylene is added while the contents of the flask are still hot. The solid is broken up carefully with a rod, and the mixture is transferred to a 2-l. beaker. The reaction flask is then rinsed with a mixture of 100 cc. of xylene and 100 cc. of water. This washing is poured into the 2-l. beaker, and an additional 600 cc. of water is added. The solid readily dissolves upon stirring. The liquid mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, shaken well, and allowed to settle. The lower aqueous layer is discarded. The xylene layer is transferred to a 1-l. distilling flask and distilled until the temperature of the liquid itself is 170°. The liquid residue is then transferred to a 500-cc. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The fore-run up to 170°/15 mm. is discarded. The product, which is collected at 170–230°/15 mm. and, solidifies within about fifteen minutes. The yield is 150–160 g. (75–80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Ethynylmagnesium chloride. While the butylmagnesium chloride is being prepared, the 2-L flask is filled with dry THF (500 mL), which is saturated by bubbling acetylene through it for 0.5–1 hr. The warm (ca. 60°C) butylmagnesium chloride is rapidly poured under a liberal blanket of nitrogen into the 1-L dropping funnel, which is then flushed with nitrogen before being stoppered. The rapid flow of acetylene is maintained. The 2-L flask is cooled to −5°C in a dry ice–acetone bath, the acetylene is bubbled rapidly through the THF, and the butylmagnesium chloride is added dropwise to the stirred reaction mixture at a rate sufficient to maintain the temperature below 20°C. This addition requires 1 hr; then acetylene is bubbled through the reaction mixture for a further 0.5 hr. (The mixture cools to about 5°C during this period.) The acetylene supply is disconnected and replaced by dry nitrogen.
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed 290 g. (165 cc., 2.49 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid. The flask is surrounded by a cooling bath and cooled with running water to about 12–15°. To the chlorosulfonic acid is added gradually 67.5 g. (0.5 mole) of acetanilide. This requires about fifteen minutes if the temperature is maintained at approximately 15°. Since large volumes of hydrogen chloride are evolved, the reaction should be conducted in a good hood, or a gas absorption trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97) might be used. After all the acetanilide has been added, the mixture is heated to 60° for two hours to complete the reaction.
A. tert-Butylurea. In a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a fast mechanical stirrer, a 200-ml. dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 193 g. (105 ml., 1.98 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and 60 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered urea is added slowly at such a rate that the temperature remains between 20° and 25°. Then 148 g. (188 ml., 2 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol is added dropwise from the funnel at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between 20° and 25°. After the addition is completed the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature overnight (about 16 hours), and then poured with stirring on 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and water in a 4-l. beaker. Without removal of the precipitate, the mixture is made alkaline to Congo red indicator by adding slowly with stirring a solution of sodium hydroxide (160 g. in 750 ml. of water). The mixture is cooled with an ice bath to keep the temperature below 25°. The mixture is stirred in the ice bath until the temperature falls to about 15°, at which point the precipitate is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water, and pressed and sucked as dry as possible. The cake is transferred to a 2-l. beaker, and 500 ml. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling and quickly filtered while hot through an 8-cm. steam-heated Büchner funnel with the aid of suction. The filtrate is cooled to 0–5° with occasional stirring, and the white precipitate of tert-butylurea is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel with suction and pressed as dry as possible. After the product has been spread out on absorbent paper and air-dried overnight there is obtained 36–39 g. (31–33%) of tert-butylurea melting at 180–182°.
B. 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane (2). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask charged with 8.96 g (54.6 mmol) of 2,3,5,6,8,9-hexahydrodiimidazo[1,2-a:2',1'-c]pyrazine is equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with nitrogen inlet tube, a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The system is flushed with N2 prior to cannulation of 218 mL (327 mmol) of 1.5 M diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAL-H) in toluene to the addition funnel. The reaction flask is cooled in an ice/water (H2O) bath and the DIBAL-H solution is added to the reaction flask with stirring over 5 min. The reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 16 hr. The reaction flask is again cooled in an ice/H2O bath prior to the addition of 200 mL of toluene . Excess DIBAL-H is quenched by the cautious dropwise addition of 20 mL of 3 M aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. When gas evolution ceases, 350 mL of 3 M aqueous KOH is added in one portion and the two-phase mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The phases are separated and chipped ice is added to the aqueous phase, which is further extracted with ice-cold CHCl3(12 × 150 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed by rotary evaporation to afford 6.19 g of white crystalline solid. Sublimation (0.05 mm, 90°C) of this material gives 5.44 g (58%) of product 2 (>98% purity by NMR; Notes 13, 14, 15).
A mixture of 125 g. (0.5 mole) of n-dodecyl bromide, 38 g. (0.5 mole) of thiourea, and 250 ml. of 95% ethanol is refluxed on a steam cone for 3 hours,, and. A solution of 30 g. (0.75 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is refluxed for 2 hours. During this period the mercaptan separates as a pink to red oil. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is acidified with dilute sulfuric acid (7 ml. of concentrated acid to 50 ml. of water) and then extracted with one 75-ml. portion of benzene. The extract is added to the crude mercaptan layer, and the whole is washed twice with 200-ml. portions of water and then dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed and the residual oil distilled from a modified Claisen flask. There is no appreciable fore-run. The yield of n-dodecyl mercaptan, b.p. 165–169°/39 mm., is 80–84 g. (79–83%) and.
The slightly yellow solution is cooled in an ice bath and 60 mL of glacial acetic acid (ca. 1 mol) and 50 mL of water are added. Hydrolysis is achieved by stirring the heterogeneous mixture at room temperature for 2 hr. The now clear solution is poured into a 2000-mL separatory funnel containing 100 mL of brine and 160 mL of water and is extracted five times with a 50:50 mixture of ether-petroleum ether (35–60°C) (1000-mL total amount). The organic phase is washed efficiently with 20 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid, 20 mL of water, and two 10-mL portions of brine.
The acetone is removed by evaporation with a rotary evaporator, and the residue is dissolved in petroleum ether (bp 30–40°C, 150 mL) and shaken in a separatory funnel with 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (150 mL). The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is washed with petroleum ether (bp 30–40°C, 3 × 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (50 mL), dried (Na2SO4), and evaporated to dryness with a rotary evaporator. The solid residue is dissolved in hot methanol (400 mL) to which has been added 3 M aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 mL). The solution may be filtered at this stage if it is necessary to remove colored insoluble impurities. Water is then added dropwise until recrystallized material is permanently present. The solution is allowed to cool, finally in ice, and crystalline bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne (BTMSBD) is collected. The material is washed with a small portion of ice-cold methanol–water (50 : 50 v/v; 50 mL), and air-dried to give bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne (31–35 g, 68–76%), mp 111–112°C (lit.2,3 107–108°C). A further 3–5 g (6–10%) of the product is obtained from the mother liquors and.
A solution of 108 g. (0.5 mole) of diethyl ethoxymethylenemalonate in 100 ml. of commercial absolute alcohol is placed in an apparatus for high-pressure hydrogenation together with 10 g. of Raney nickel catalyst. The pressure in the bomb is raised to 1000–1500 lb. with hydrogen, and the temperature is adjusted to 45°. The bomb is shaken, and the reaction is allowed to proceed for 12–20 hours, during which time 0.5 mole of hydrogen is absorbed.
C. (2S,4S)-2,4,5-Trihydroxypentanoic acid 4,5-acetonide methyl ester 4. A 100-mL, round-bottomed reaction flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, reflux condenser, and an argon inlet tube is charged with 5.4 g (25 mmol) of the diacetate 3, 0.5 g (2.5 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 5 mL of methanol. After the mixture is refluxed for 3 hr and cooled to room temperature, 18 mL (140 mmol) of 2,2-dimethoxypropane is added. After 3 hr of stirring, sodium acetate (powder, 0.41 g, 5 mmol) is added and the mixture is stirred for 20 min to quench the reaction. Ethyl acetate (50 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL) are added to the reaction mixture. The organic layer is removed and the aqueous layer is back-extracted twice with 25-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with 25 mL of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated to afford 5.5 g of a colorless oil. Distillation through a short path distillation apparatus (with no forerun) gives 4.6 g of 4 (90% yield) as a colorless oil, bp 71–78°C (0.1 mm).
The reaction mixture is poured into 300 ml. of water, and the resulting mixture is made basic with 40% sodium hydroxide. The mixture is shaken three times with 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether extracts are washed with 10 ml. of saturated sodium chloride. After drying over potassium carbonate, the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator, giving 22.9–25.0 g. (91–99%) of product, which is used without purification in the next step.

To the flask is added 175 mL of anhydrous methanol. The flask is flushed with a stream of nitrogen, and then, with stirring, heated to an internal temperature of 67 °C for 1 h with a heating mantle. Tin(II) chloride (62.7 g, 331 mmol) is then slowly added to the flask over five min in equal portions. The flask is again flushed with a stream of nitrogen and the reaction mixture is stirred at 67 °C for 12 h. The solution is then allowed to cool to room temperature. To a 500-mL beaker is added potassium carbonate (45.7 g, 331 mmol), which is dissolved completely in 300 mL water. The reaction solution is made alkaline (pH approximately 8, as determined by pH paper) through the slow addition of the potassium carbonate solution (ca. 225 mL) while stirring, resulting in a light orange slurry. To this slurry is added 200 mL of diethyl ether, and the complete mixture is then filtered through a Büchner funnel (Whatman filter paper, 125 mm diameter). An additional 75 mL of ether is added to rinse the reaction vessel, and subsequently passed through the funnel. After all the aqueous / ethereal solution has passed through the funnel, it is washed with ethyl ether (2 × 100 mL). The filter cake is then transferred to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and slurried in 300 mL of ethyl acetate for 30 min before being filtered through a Büchner funnel (Whatman filter paper, 125 mm diameter). The filtrates are combined, transferred to a 2000-mL separatory funnel, where the aqueous layer is removed and the organic layer is washed with brine (100 mL). The organic phase is dried by the addition of magnesium sulfate (15 g), then is filtered and and the filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C, 80 mmHg) in a 1000-mL round bottom flask to provide the methyl ester 1 as a yellow oil.

The flask is flushed with argon and charged with [Cp*RhCl2]2 (45.8 mg, 0.074 mmol, 0.25 mol%), AgSbF6 (102 mg, 0.30 mmol, 1.00 mol%), Cu(OAc)2 (11.3 g, 62.2 mmol, 2.10 equiv) and 1,4-dioxane (30 mL). N,N-Diethylbenzamide (5.25 g, 29.6 mmol, 1 equiv) in 1,4-dioxane (10 mL) is added via cannula and styrene (5.11 mL, 44.4 mmol, 1.50 equiv) is added via syringe into the resulting blue-green suspension. The rubber septum is changed to a glass stopper and the stirred suspension is heated in an oil bath (125 °C) for 23 h. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, gravity filtered through a cotton plug into a 500-mL round bottomed flask and rinsed with toluene (150 mL). The resulting green solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C water bath, 40 mmHg,). Toluene (2 x 200 mL) is added and then evaporated twice (40 °C water bath, 40 mmHg). The crude is filtered through a short plug of silica gel, washed with EtOAc (500 mL), and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C water bath, 70 mmHg) to provide a yellow viscous oil. This material is purified by silica gel column chromatography. The combined eluent is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C water bath, 70 mmHg) and then submitted to high vacuum (0.3 mmHg) at 80 °C for 24 h to furnish 7.62 g (27.3 mmol, 92%) of (E)-N,N-diethyl-2-styrylbenzamide as a light yellow viscous oil.
A solution of 257 g. (1.05 moles) of barium chloride dihydrate in about 500 cc. of hot water is added to the reaction mixture, with vigorous shaking, and the mixture is heated on a steam bath for one-half hour. A heavy precipitate of the barium salt of the amino acid separates at once. After cooling to room temperature, the barium salt is collected on a suction filter, transferred to a beaker, and washed with two 250-cc. portions of hot water (80°). After drying at 100°, the barium salt weighs 225–230 g. (80–82 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The triphenylphosphine oxide precipitate is filtered and washed with 50 ml. of pentane. The solvent is removed from the combined filtrate with a rotary evaporator under water aspirator pressure at room temperature. Distillation of the residue through a 2-cm. Vigreux column attached to a short-path distillation apparatus provides 13.0–14.0 g. (75–81%) of geranyl chloride, b.p. 47–49° (0.4 mm.), n23D = 1.4794.
The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the ether is stripped through a short helices-packed column. The residue is fractionally distilled at 103–105°/745 mm.;nD20 1.4330;nD251.4304; d4250.8211. The yield is 53–62 g. (67–79%).
An efficient condenser (60 cm. or longer) is fitted with an adapter to which is sealed a length of 9-mm. tubing extending nearly to the bottom of a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, which serves as the distillation receiver and. The adapter should be connected to the receiver with a two-hole stopper carrying a drying tube if anhydrous diazomethane is desired. The receiver is placed in a well-mixed ice-salt mixture, and sufficient anhydrous ether (about 200 ml.) is added to cover the tip of the adapter.
B. (S)-(+)-N-(Benzylidene)-p-toluenesulfinamide (3) :2 An oven-dried, 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum is charged with 10.35 g (66.8 mmol) of (S)-(+)-p-toluenesulfinamide (2) . The reaction flask is placed under vacuum (1 mm) for 30 min to remove residual moisture. The vessel is then placed under an argon atmosphere and dichloromethane (135 mL) is added via cannula. The solution is stirred rapidly and 7.07 g (66.6 mmol) of benzaldehyde is added via syringe, followed by 76.0 g (333 mmol) of titanium(IV) ethoxide via cannula. The septum is removed, the solution is fitted with a reflux condenser topped with an argon gas line and the yellow solution is heated under reflux for 5 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and poured into water (85 mL) in a 600-mL beaker with rapid stirring. Dichloromethane (50 mL) is added to the mixture, which is then filtered through a Buchner funnel using filter paper of medium porosity. The filter cake is rinsed with dichloromethane (3 × 70 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and washed with water (3 × 70 mL), brine (70 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and filtered. The solution is concentrated using a rotary evaporator while keeping the bath temperature below 40°C to afford 15.0 g (92%) of analytically pure product as a white solid.
A high-pressure bomb of about 1.1-l. capacity is charged with 82 g. (0.50 mole) of sebaconitrile and about 6 g. of Raney nickel catalyst suspended in 25 ml. of 95% ethanol, an additional 25 ml. of ethanol being used to rinse in the catalyst. The bomb is closed, and about 68 g. (4 moles) of liquid ammonia is introduced from a tared 5-lb. commercial cylinder. Hydrogen is then admitted at tank pressure (1500 lb.), and the temperature is raised to 125°. The reaction starts at about 90° and proceeds rapidly at 110–125°. When hydrogen is no longer absorbed (1–2 hours) the heater is shut off and the bomb allowed to cool. The hydrogen and ammonia are allowed to escape, and the contents of the bomb are rinsed out with two 100-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The ethanolic solution is filtered quickly through a layer of decolorizing carbon to remove the catalyst and transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask having a modified side arm and connected by ground-glass joints to a receiver. The ethanol is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, the receiver is changed, and the decamethylenediamine is distilled under reduced pressure. It boils at 143–146°/14 mm. and solidifies, on cooling, to a white solid, freezing point 60°. The yield is 68–69 g. (79–80%),, and.
B. Sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate. 2-Nitrobenzenesulfinic acid (3.74 g., 0.020 mole) is suspended in 10 ml. of water, and sufficient 1N NaOH (about 20 ml.) is added to the well-stirred mixture to dissolve the acid and bring the pH to 9. Palladium oxide (0.2–1.0 g.,) is suspended in 20 ml. of water in a 200-ml. glass hydrogenation bottle. The bottle is attached to a hydrogenation apparatus such as that of Adams and Voorhees,2 and the suspension is shaken with hydrogen under a pressure of 1–3 atm. until the palladium oxide is reduced. The solution of 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is added, and the mixture is shaken under a hydrogen pressure of 1–3 atm. The solution becomes completely decolorized in 2–6 hours, during which time about 95% of the calculated amount of hydrogen is absorbed. The catalyst is separated by filtration and washed with two 20-ml. portions of water, which are added to the filtrate. The filtrate, which may have a yellowish color, is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (bath temperature 45°). The residue, a white or light yellow solid, is sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate. After being dried in a desiccator over calcium chloride, it weighs 3.05–3.20 g. (85–89%).
After ca. 20 hr at 55–60°C, the mixture is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, and then 1.1 g (0.03 mol) of sodium borohydride is added. Stirring is continued at room temperature for about 1 hr. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives an oil that is taken up in 100 mL of ethyl acetate and washed once with a solution that is prepared by mixing 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide with 25 mL of distilled water. The organic layer is washed twice more with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide and finally with 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and. Addition of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtration through a column of 75 g of silica gel, elution with ethyl acetate, and evaporation of the solvent on a rotary evaporator provides 21.5 g of the crude oxyaminated product. The solid is then washed twice with ether to give 13.8–14.9 g (51–55%) of white, crystalline 2-methyl-3-(p-toluenesulfonamido)-2-pentanol, mp 96–97°C. Concentration of the ether yields an additional 4.0–5.0 g (15–18%) of oxyaminated product, mp 95–97°C.
The electrodes are connected to a suitable source of direct current, 10 amperes of which is allowed to pass through the cell. To the solution there is now added 40 g. more of monoethyl sebacate in portions of 10 g. each over a period of 10 minutes. The temperature of the cell is held below 50° by running cold water through the cooling coil.
This complex (7.3 g, 7.2 mmol) is treated with 200 mL of 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and extracted twice with 150-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform layer is washed with 60 mL of 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and two 100-mL portions of water and is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. Evaporation of the filtrate affords 5.25 g of colorless solid that is dried at 80°C (0.05 mm) to give 4.65 g (99% yield based on the complex used) of (R)-BINAPO, mp 256–258°C, [α]D25 +388° (benzene, c 0.514).
At room temperature there is added in one portion a solution of 11 g. (0.037 mole, 50% excess over the theoretical amount) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 20 ml. of water. A rise in temperature of some 6–7° will be observed; it is desirable to moderate the temperature by external cooling if it should rise above 35°.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an 80-cm. reflux condenser, are placed 3 l. of absolute alcohol and 490 g. (327 cc., 4.1 moles) of chloroform. The flask is arranged for outside cooling by running water. To the solution, 207 g. (9 atoms) of clean sodium cut into pieces which will conveniently drop through the condenser is added during the course of about two hours. In order to add the sodium at this rate, the flask must be cooled during the addition. When the sodium has entirely reacted and the mixture has been cooled to room temperature, the sodium chloride which has separated is removed by suction filtration with the use of thoroughly dry apparatus. The salt is washed on the filter with 200 cc. of absolute alcohol, and the washings are allowed to run into the main filtrate.
The upper layer of oil is separated, run at once into an open vessel, and washed with water to which a little hydrochloric acid has been added. Yellow crystals form at once, and the yield of azoxybenzene melting at 35.5–36.5° is 102 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
In a 600-cc. beaker 210 g. (0.88 mole) of ethyl bromomalonate (p. 245) and 165 g. (0.89 mole) of potassium phthalimide (p. 119) are intimately stirred together. The mixture is stirred approximately every ten minutes. If no spontaneous reaction starts within one-half hour, it is necessary to initiate the reaction by heating to 110–120°. The mixture then becomes liquid and can be stirred easily. It turns to a light brown color, especially near the top where it comes in contact with the air. When the temperature begins to drop, the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 110° for one hour to insure completion of the reaction.
In a 2-l. beaker, 86 g. (0.5 mole) of p-bromoaniline is dissolved in 240 ml. of glacial acetic acid and 480 ml. of water at 35°. This solution is treated with a solution of 65 g. (1 mole) of sodium cyanate in 450 ml. of water at 35°. About 50 ml. of the sodium cyanate solution is added slowly with stirring until a white crystalline precipitate of the product appears. The rest is then added quickly with vigorous agitation. The very rapid separation of the product is accompanied by a rise in the temperature to 50–55°. The thick, paste-like suspension is stirred for another 10 minutes, allowed to stand at room temperature for 2–3 hours, and diluted with 200 ml. of water. After cooling to 0°, the material is filtered with suction, washed with water, drained thoroughly, and dried. The yield of crude p-bromophenylurea, a white crystalline powder, is 95–100 g. (88–93%). The product is sufficiently pure for further synthetic work, but it can be recrystallized from aqueous ethanol (12 ml. of ethanol and 3 ml. of water per gram of crude material) to give a 65% recovery of lustrous white prisms of p-bromophenylurea, m.p. 225–227°. This method is suitable for the preparation in excellent yields of a large number of arylureas.
In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel are placed 8.08 g. (0.040 mole) of pyrene and 80 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. A solution of 2.0 ml. of bromine (6.24 g., 0.039 mole) in 30 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is added dropwise over a period of 2–3 hours. The resulting orange solution is stirred overnight, washed with three 100-ml. portions of water, and dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, the pale yellow solid residue is dissolved in 10 ml. of benzene, and the benzene solution is treated with a small amount of activated carbon. The filtrate is diluted with 120 ml. of absolute ethanol, and the solution is distilled until about 80–90 ml. of solvent remains and then cooled. The bromopyrene crystallizes as pale yellow flakes, m.p. 93–95°. Additional material of similar melting point is obtained from the mother liquor on concentration. The total yield is 8.5–9.5 g. (78–86%). On recrystallization from benzene-alcohol a colorless product, m.p. 94.5–95.5°, is obtained with little loss.
B. 2-Phenyl-1-pyrroline . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, addition funnel, heating mantle, reflux condenser, and a short-path distilling head, is charged with 0.5 L of 6 N hydrochloric acid and heated at reflux; 100 g (0.46 mol) of crude keto lactam is dissolved in 62.5 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the solution is slowly added, over 1.5-2 hr. Tetrahydrofuran is collected during the addition by use of the short-path distilling head. Following the addition, the distilling head is removed and the solution is heated at reflux for 4 hr, cooled to room temperature, filtered through a plug of glass wool, cooled to 0°C, made basic to pH 12 by using aqueous 50% sodium hydroxide , and extracted with methylene chloride (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 69.2 g of crude product as an amber oil. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure (1-3 mm) and the fraction boiling at 75-85°C is collected to afford 41.0 g (61% yield) of purified product as a clear, colorless oil that solidifies on standing.
One liter of absolute methanol is cooled in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask to 0° in an ice-salt bath, and 80 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly added, with good shaking, the temperature being kept at 0°. The flask is removed from the freezing mixture, and 255 g. (1 mole) of ammonium 1,2-naphthoquinone-4-sulfonate (p. 633) is added and made into an even paste by thorough shaking. After standing for 30 minutes, during which time the temperature rises to 15–20°, the flask is heated gradually on the steam bath with continuous shaking and rotating so that the solution reaches its boiling point in about 15 minutes. The solution becomes red, sulfur dioxide is evolved, and methoxynaphthoquinone begins to separate. The mixture is kept boiling very gently, with continued shaking, for 15 minutes, when the paste of separated material becomes very stiff. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of methanol is added, and the heating and rotating continued for an additional 15–20 minutes. The reaction mixture is cooled to 20–25°, water and ice are added until the flask is nearly filled, and the methoxynaphthoquinone is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with cold water until the filtrate is nearly colorless; about 2–2.5 l. of water is required.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and separatory funnel, are placed 381 g. (1.5 moles) of iodine and 400 g. (455 cc., 5.1 moles) of benzene. The mixture is heated to about 50° on a water bath, and 275 cc. (6.15 moles) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.50) is added slowly from the separatory funnel; the time required for the addition should be about one and one-quarter hours. A copious evolution of oxides of nitrogen takes place, and the gases are carried off from the upper end of the condenser to an open window or hood, or absorbed by means of a gas trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97). The reaction proceeds smoothly, and the temperature rises slowly without the application of heat until the mixture boils gently. When all the nitric acid has been added, the solution is refluxed for about fifteen minutes. If iodine still remains, more nitric acid should be added slowly to the warm solution until the purple color of the iodine has been discharged and the solution becomes brownish red.
In a 2-l. bottle equipped with a mechanical stirrer are mixed 635 g. (800 cc., 11.0 moles) of u. s. p. acetone and, 420 g. (400 cc., 4.0 moles) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde boiling at 178–180° (shaken with dilute sodium carbonate just before distillation), and 400 cc. of water. To this mixture, 100 cc. of 10 per cent aqueous sodium hydroxide is slowly added from a dropping funnel, while the solution is stirred, and cooled by a water bath. The rate of addition of the alkali is so regulated that the temperature remains between 25–31°. This requires from one-half to one hour. The mixture is now stirred for two and one-quarter hours at room temperature. At the end of this time dilute hydrochloric acid is added until the mixture is acid to litmus. The two layers which form are separated in a separatory funnel. The lower aqueous layer is extracted with 100 cc. of benzene, and the benzene solution added to the yellow oil which formed the upper layer in the first separation. This benzene solution is shaken with 100 cc. of water and separated.
A 1-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, an inlet tube, and a reflux condenser which is connected through a sodalime tube to a gas-absorption trap. The apparatus is dried in an oven and assembled rapidly to exclude moisture; it is advisable to set up the apparatus in a hood to vent ammonia that may escape by accident. The flask is cooled in a Dry Ice-trichloroethylene bath, and 200 ml. of anhydrous (refrigeration grade) ammonia is introduced through the inlet tube from an ammonia cylinder which is either inverted or equipped with a siphon tube. Just before the apparatus is assembled, 8.1 g. (0.35 gram atom) of sodium is cut, weighed, and kept under kerosene in a small beaker. The Dry Ice bath is removed, the inlet tube is replaced by a rubber stopper, and a crystal of hydrated ferric nitrate (about 0.2 g.) is added. A small (about 5-mm.) cube of the sodium is cut, blotted rapidly with filter paper, and added quickly to the liquid ammonia. The solution is stirred until the blue color disappears, after which the remainder of the sodium is added in narrow, thin strips about as rapidly as it can be cut and blotted, while the solution is stirred vigorously. After the solution has turned from blue to gray, the flask is swirled by hand until the blue flecks of sodium that have spattered onto the upper part of the flask are washed into the solution.
A. N-(2-Pyridyl)triflimide (1). A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a rubber septum is charged with 2-aminopyridine (19.859 g, 0.211 mol) and pyridine (35.04 g, 35.88 mL, 0.443 mol) in 800 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) under an argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture is cooled to −78°C and a solution of triflic anhydride (125 g, 74.54 mL, 0.443 mol) in 150 mL of CH2Cl2 is added dropwise via a cannula over 3.5 hr with vigorous stirring. After the solution is stirred for 2 hr at −78°C, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued at room temperature for 19 hr. The reaction mixture is quenched with 50 mL of cold water and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with cold aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide (1 × 150 mL), cold water (1 × 100 mL), brine (1 × 100 mL) and dried over magnesium sulfate. After filtration, the solvent is removed under vacuum to give 69 g of the crude product. After Kugelrohr distillation, 61 g (81%) of pure N-(2-pyridyl)triflimide (bp 85–100°C/0.25 mm, mp 41–42°C) is obtained as a white solid.
The mother liquors are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35°C) to give a colorless oil that is redissolved in 100 mL of hexanes and poured onto a 250-g pad of silica gel contained in a 500-mL sintered-glass funnel, preequilibrated with hexanes. Using this simple silica pad, 100-mL fractions are collected, diluting first with 1 L of hexanes, followed by 3 L of 9:1 hexanes: ethyl acetate, and finally with 600 mL of ethyl acetate. After TLC analysis of the eluants, fractions 3–18 are combined and concentrated initially on a rotary evaporator (40°C) and finally dried at 0.5 mm to afford 52.0 (98% of theory) of (−)-(1S,2R)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate as a colorless oil, [α]D25 −14.3° (benzene, c 10). Fractions 20–28 are combined and concentrated as above to afford 15.8 g of the (−)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol, mp 62–65°C, [α]D25 −54.9° (methanol, c 2.1).
B. Di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. A solution of 20.0 g. (0.0763 mole) of di-tert-butyl tricarbonate in 75 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is placed in a 600-ml. beaker fitted with a magnetic stirrer, and 0.10 g. (0.89 mmole) of freshly sublimed 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Dabco) is added, resulting in the rapid evolution of carbon dioxide. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25° for 45 minutes, to complete the loss of carbon dioxide, before 35 ml. of water, containing citric acid sufficient to make the aqueous layer slightly acidic, is added. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at 25° with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 13.3–15.1 g. (80–91%) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate as a colorless liquid, b.p. 55–56° (0.15 mm.) or 62–65° (0.4 mm.) nD25 1.4071–1.4072.
A. Diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate. In a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a constant-pressure dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a reflux condenser is placed 174 g. (1.0 mole) of ethyl azodicarboxylate2 in 150 ml. of ether. Freshly prepared cyclopentadiene3 (70 g., 1.06 moles) is added dropwise over a 1-hour period to the stirred ethereal solution of diethyl azodicarboxylate. During the addition a gentle reflux is maintained by external cooling with an ice-water bath as needed. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for 4 hours, or less if the yellow color of the azodicarboxylic acid ester disappears. The dropping funnel and condenser are replaced by a glass stopper and a short distillation head, respectively. The ether and unreacted diene are distilled off on a steam bath and the residue is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed boiling flask equipped with a 30-cm. Vigreux column. After a small forerun the diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylate distills to give 218–228 g. (91–95%) of a colorless or very pale yellow, viscous liquid, b.p. 119–120° (0.4 mm.).
A solution of 50 g. (0.42 mole) of acetophenone (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 111) in 50 cc. of pure anhydrous ether is placed in a dry three-necked flask fitted with a separatory funnel, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser. The solution is cooled in an ice bath, 0.5 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride is introduced, and 67 g. (21.5 cc., 0.42 mole) of bromine is added gradually from the separatory funnel, with stirring, at the rate of about 1 cc. per minute. The bromine color disappears rapidly although very little hydrogen bromide is evolved; towards the end of the reaction the solution becomes pink.
The solution is saturated with sodium chloride and distilled with steam until all the 2-chlorocyclopentanol is collected, which requires distillation of a volume of about 2 l. The distillate is saturated with sodium chloride, the oily layer separated, and the aqueous layer extracted four times with 300-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are added to the oil, and the solution is washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure through a total condensation, variable take-off, 15 by 1.5 cm. column packed with glass helices. A trap cooled with Dry Ice is placed in the vacuum line between the column and the pump. Low-boiling fractions, b.p. 43–81°/15 mm., amount to 19–40 g.. The trans-2-chlorocyclopentanol is collected at 81–82°/15 mm. in a yield of 126–135 g. (52–56%); nD25 1.4770.
The oil is purified by stepped-gradient flash chromatography on silica gel (column diameter 90 mm, 225 g SiO2).The column is dry-packed with silica gel, equilibrated with hexanes (500 mL, passed through the column twice), and the compound is loaded directly onto the silica with dichloromethane (3 mL). The vessel containing the crude material is rinsed with 95:5 hexanes:EtOAc (5 mL), and additional dichloromethane (5 mL), which are then used to rinse the sides of the column. After adding a layer of sand (~12 mm.) to the column, the compound is eluted with the following ratios (v:v) of hexanes:EtOAc: 95:5 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 90:10 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 85:15 (500 mL, discarded to forerun), 80:20 (500 mL), 75:25 (1000 mL), 70:30 (500 mL), 65:35 (500 mL), and 60:40 (500 mL).Fractions are collected in 25 mm x 150 mm test-tubes (~65-70 mL).The fractions containing only product as determined by TLC are rinsed with EtOAc into a tared 1 L recovery flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 74 mmHg).A small, tared PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar (7 mm x 2 mm) is added to the viscous, colorless oil before drying on high vacuum (0.1 mmHg, 20 °C) for 1 h to remove any traces of solvent.A heat gun is used to gently warm the oil while on high vacuum and the heat is removed as soon as gas bubbles begin to evolve.After drying, the flask contained 7.16-7.70 g (78%-83% yield) of ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)-butanoate as a colorless viscous oil.
When 85 g. (0.32 mole) of p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate is thus decomposed, there is obtained 38–40 g. of p-fluorobenzoic acid (84–89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the fluoborate; 63–69 per cent based on the ester of p-aminobenzoic acid). The melting point of the purified acid is 186°. The crude acid melts at 183–184°.
F. 1-Amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate. The pentane solution from Step D is stirred with a magnetic stirrer and cooled to 0°, and 3.9 ml. (0.068 mole) of acetic acid is measured. Three drops of acetic acid are added at first, and stirring is continued at 0° until the precipitation of white 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate begins. If necessary, crystallization is initiated by scratching with a glass rod or by addition of a seed crystal from a previous run. The remainder of the acetic acid is added over a 10-minute period, and stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at 0°. The salt is filtered, washed with 30 ml. of pentane precooled to 0°, and dried in a vacuum desiccator (10 mm.) at room temperature, yielding 10.0–10.5 g. (76–79%) of product, m.p. 69–70° which is suitable for preparative purposes. Recrystallization is possible; however, it must be carefully carried out to avoid the formation of a yellow product, whose melting point is lower than that of the crude product. A solution of 10 g. of 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate in 40 ml. of dichloromethane is prepared at a maximum temperature of 20–22°. The turbid solution is immediately filtered through Celite®, which is washed with two 10-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The resulting clear solution is treated with 200–250 ml. of pentane until crystallization just begins, and placed in a deep freeze at −25° for 2 hours. Filtration, washing with 30 ml. of pentane precooled to 0°, and drying as before, afford 9.2–9.3 g. of 1-amino-2-phenylaziridinium acetate, m.p. 70–72° and.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser and a separatory funnel are placed 82 g. (1.2 moles) of potassium cyanide (95 per cent) and 100 cc. of water. The mixture is warmed and stirred until the cyanide is completely dissolved. To this solution is added 350 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, followed by 158 g. (1 mole) of trimethylene chlorobromide, and the mixture is heated under a reflux condenser (best on a water bath) with stirring for about one and one-half hours.
B. 3,7-Dimethyl-3-trichloroacetamido-1,6-octadiene (2). A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with imidate 1 and 300 ml. of xylene. The solution is refluxed for 8 hours. After cooling to room temperature the dark xylene solution is filtered through a short column (4.5 cm. in diameter) packed with silica gel (70 g.) and toluene. The column is eluted with an additional 250 ml. of toluene, and the combined light yellow eluant is concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Vacuum distillation through a 15-cm. Vigreux column yields 20–22 g. (67–74% for the two steps) of octadiene 2 as a colorless liquid, b.p. 94–97° (0.03 mm.).
(A) Preparation of Cuprous Cyanide.—(Note 1)—In a 6-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stopper carrying a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a gas exit tube leading to a good hood, is placed a solution of 650 g. (2.6 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate in 4 l. of water. The flask is surrounded by an oil bath and heated to about 80°. The stirrer is started and a solution of 255 g. (5.2 moles) of sodium cyanide in 650 cc. of water is added from the separatory funnel over a period of about one-half hour. Then the mixture is boiled until no more cyanogen gas is evolved. This requires about five to ten minutes.
C. (S)-Tetrahydro-1-methyl-3,3-diphenyl-1H,3H-pyrrolo[1,2-c][1,3,2]oxazaborole-borane complex. A 500-mL, four-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated thermocouple probe, 60-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, and distillation head connected to a wide-bore, air-cooled condenser. The flask is charged with 200 mL of xylenes and (S)-diphenylprolinol (50.0 g, 198 mmol). To the vigorously stirred solution at 20°C is added a 50% (w/w) solution of trimethylboroxine (TMB) in tetrahydrofuran (38 g, containing 19 g, 152 mmol of TMB) dropwise over a 15-min period. The addition funnel is rinsed with dry xylenes (10 mL). During the addition an exothermic reaction occurs (warming the mixture to ca. 35°C) resulting in the formation of the bismethylboronic acid adduct as a white precipitate. After the addition, the mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr, then heated and concentrated by distillation (1 atm) to a volume of ca. 100 mL. The mixture is allowed to cool to ca. 60°C, and is charged with additional dry xylenes (200 mL). The distillation and nitrogen sweep are continued, this time until essentially all the solvent is removed. The mixture is then heated so that the internal temperature is maintained between 160–180°C for a 0.5-hr period. The pale yellow oil (free oxazaborolidine) is cooled to 20°C and, and diluted with dry xylenes to a volume of 100 mL. The distillation head is replaced with a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel. At this point, the nitrogen sweep is discontinued; however, the vessel is maintained under a static atmosphere of nitrogen for the remainder of the reaction. To the well stirred solution is added neat (10 M) borane-methyl sulfide (21 mL, 210 mmol) over a 5-min period via syringe. The mixture is stirred for 0.5 hr at 20°C, then slowly diluted with dry hexane to a volume of 450 mL over a 1–2 hr period. After the addition is complete, the mixture is aged for 1 hr at 20°C, cooled to −10°C, and then aged for 2 hr at −10°C. The mixture is filtered in an enclosed Schlenk filter. The cake is washed with dry hexane (3 × 50 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure (100 mBar, nitrogen sweep, 20°C) for 1 hr to afford 51–53 g of the title compound as a free-flowing white crystalline solid,(Note 32).
A. Cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid. The benzene solution is diluted with an additional 100 ml. of hot benzene and transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel. The solution is allowed to cool until it is slightly above room temperature, and then 200 ml. of ether is added, small portions being used to rinse the reaction flask. After the solution has cooled to room temperature, it is washed with two 50-ml. portions of cold water. The emulsion which normally forms at this point is broken by slow filtration through a Büchner funnel. The ether is removed, and the benzene solution is concentrated to approximately 300 ml. by distillation under reduced pressure. The solution is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature and then is cooled to about 10° in a refrigerator. Cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid crystallizes as colorless prisms. It is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold benzene (10°), and dried in a vacuum desiccator to constant weight (88–92 g.). The filtrate and washings are concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure to about 150 ml. and cooled as in the first crystallization. The second crop of crystals is separated by filtration, washed with two 50-ml. portions of cold benzene (10°), and dried in a vacuum desiccator to constant weight (21–25 g.). Further concentration of the mother liquor and washings to a volume of about 75 ml. followed by cooling, filtering, washing with two 10-ml. portions of cold benzene, and drying yields an additional 2–5 g. The total yield of cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid, m.p. 110–110.5°, is 108–126 g. (65–76%).
In a 5-l. two-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a separatory funnel, are placed an aqueous solution of 348 g. (5 moles) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 318) in 600 cc. of cold water and 460 g. (4 moles) of heptaldehyde. Stirring is started, and a solution of 265 g. (2.5 moles) of anhydrous c.p. sodium carbonate in 500 cc. of water is added at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above 45°. Stirring is continued at room temperature for an hour after the addition of the sodium carbonate solution is complete.
B. Ethyl 4-(4-(4-methylphenylsulfonamido)phenyl)butanoate (2). A 500-mL 3-necked Morton flask with 24/40 ground-glass joints is equipped with a nitrogen-gas inlet on the left neck, a glass stopper on the right neck, and the center neck is equipped for mechanical stirring (glass bearing, glass stirrer rod, 60 mm PTFE paddle, RW 20 Tekmar motor). NiI2.xH2O (528 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv), 4,4'-di-methoxy-2,2'-bipyridine (284 mg, 1.31 mmol, 0.051 equiv), sodium iodide (1.25 g, 8.34 mmol, 0.33 equiv), and N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (8.33 g, 25.5 mmol, 1.00 equiv) are transferred via powder funnel through the right neck of the Morton flask.To these solids, 1,3-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU, 105 mL) is added from a graduated cylinder.Then pyridine (105 μL, 1.31 mmol, 0.053 equiv) and ethyl 4-bromobutyrate (4.0 mL, 28 mmol, 1.1 equiv) are added by syringe.A gas outlet adapter with tubing attached to an oil-filled bubbler is placed in the right neck before submerging the reaction vessel up to the solvent line in an oil bath pre-equilibrated to 60 °C.The vessel headspace is purged with nitrogen for 15 min while the mixture is stirred (500-600 rpm).After the nitrogen purge is complete, the gas outlet on the right neck is replaced with the original glass stopper and the reaction mixture is stirred at 60 °C until the reaction mixture takes on a dark green color (15-30 min). Next, zinc powder (6-9 μm, 3.44 g, 52.6 mmol, 2.06 equiv) is added through a powder funnel attached to the right neck under a positive flow of nitrogen.The flask is kept under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen during the course of the reaction.Generally within 5-15 min after the addition of zinc, the reaction undergoes a characteristic dark green to orange-brown color change, indicating the reaction has begun.The reaction is judged complete when the color changes to black.
A. 3,4,5-Trimethyl-2,5-heptadien-4-ol. Lithium wire (1/8 in.) is cut up into approximately 1-cm lengths and washed with hexane. A mixture of the cut-up lithium (21 g, 3.0 mol) in 100 mL of diethyl ether from a freshly opened can is stirred well under argon in a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a 250-mL addition funnel. 2-Bromo-2-butene (cis-trans mixture) is purified and dried by passing it through a 2 × 15-cm column of basic alumina. An addition funnel is charged with 2-bromo-2-butene (200 g, 1.48 mol) and a small amount of the alkene is added dropwise to the flask until reaction begins, as shown by warming of the reaction mixture and formation of bubbles on the surface of the lithium. At this point the mixture is diluted with an additional 900 mL of fresh diethyl ether, and the remainder of the 2-bromo-2-butene is added at a rate sufficient to maintain gentle reflux. Stirring is continued for 1 hr following completion of this addition, after which ethyl acetate (66 g, 0.75 mol) diluted with an equal volume of fresh diethyl ether is added dropwise via the addition funnel. The reaction mixture turns from yellow-orange to milky-yellow with this addition. It is then poured into 2 L of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is adjusted to approximately pH 9 with hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is extracted three times with diethyl ether. The combined ethereal layers are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to 100–200 mL by rotary evaporation.
In a 12-l. flask, equipped with a low-temperature thermometer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath, a solution of sulfurous acid is prepared by saturating 2.4 l. of water at 0–5° with sulfur dioxide from a cylinder. A brisk stream of the gas is continued while the cold diazonium salt solution is added in about 150-ml. portions over a 30-minute period and the temperature is maintained at 5–10°; the reaction mixture assumes a dark orange color. The cooling bath is removed, but sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture for an additional 30 minutes. After the mixture has been allowed to stand for 12 hours at room temperature, 3 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added; the o-hydrazinobenzoic acid hydrochloride separates at once. The mixture is chilled to 0–5° and filtered through a precooled Büchner funnel; the product is washed with two 50-ml. portions of ice-cold dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid. The yield is 50–51 g. (86–88%); the salt melts at 194–195° with decomposition and is suitable for the next step without further purification.
A Hanovia, 550-watt, immersion photochemical reactor equipped with a magnetic stirrer and water condenser is charged with 1 l. of diethyl ether, 180 g. (1.96 moles) of bicyclo[2.2.1]hepta-2,5-diene (2,5-norbornadiene,, and 8 g. of acetophenone. The system is flushed briefly with a stream of nitrogen, then irradiated for about 36–48 hours. After irradiation, the ether is removed by distillation through a 20-cm. Vigreux column. The residue, a clear liquid weighing about 185 g., is distilled through a spinning-band column under reduced pressure, yielding 126–145 g. (70–80%) of quadricyclane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 70° (200 mm.).
A. (E)-6,10-Dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-1-yne. An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped by a rubber septum, a dry-ice condenser capped by a rubber septum, and a rubber septum (capping the central neck) bearing a stainless-steel cannula that serves as an argon inlet. The flask is charged with 190 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether and cooled to ca. −78°C using a dry ice–acetone bath. On a separate assembly, allene gas (d at −40°C = 0.67 g/mL) from a compressed-gas cylinder is condensed into a dry, 100-mL Pyrex graduated cylinder equipped with a 24/40 standard taper joint attached to a Claisen adapter and dry-ice condenser (containing a slurry of dry ice–acetone) and cooled to −78°C with a bath of dry ice–acetone. After 22.5 mL (375 mmol) of liquid allene has been collected, the adapter and the condenser are removed and the graduated cylinder is capped with a rubber septum through which is inserted a cannula. The other end of this cannula is inserted through the rubber septum on the central neck to reach just below the surface of the cooled solvent. The allene is then transferred to the reaction vessel by removing the cylinder from the cooling bath. The temperature of the reaction vessel is maintained at −78°C, and a solution of 190 mL of 1.37 M butyllithium (260 mmol) in hexane is added dropwise over 1 hr through the addition funnel, which is then rinsed with 5 mL of dry ether. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm gradually (over ca. 30 min) to −15°C and the white precipitate that forms is stirred an additional 15 min under an argon atmosphere. A solution of 12.9 g (75 mmol) of geranyl chloride in 40 mL of dry ether is added dropwise over 303 min through the addition funnel while maintaining the temperature at −15°C. Then the stirred mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 1 hr. The resulting white suspension containing the lithium acetylide 2 is carefully poured into 450 mL of ice-water slurry, the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride, and the product is extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure using a 25-cm Vigreux column. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to afford 10.5–11.2 g (79–89% yield) of (E)-6,10-dimethyl-5,9-undecadien-1-yne, bp 103–107°C (10 mm).
A. 2,3-Dihydro-2-Tert-Butyldimethysiloxy-1H-Indene. A flame-dried 500-mL, four-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a nitrogen inlet, an internal thermometer and a glass stopper is charged successively under nitrogen atmosphere with 2-indanol (13.42 g, 100 mmol), imidazole (8.17 g, 120 mmol) and 60 mL of dry N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture is stirred until a clear solution has formed. The flask is immersed in an ice bath and a solution of tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (16.32 g, 108 mmol) in 40 mL of dry DMF is added over a period of 10 min at such a rate that the reaction temperature remains below 10 °C. The ice-water bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirring is continued for 45 min. Deionized water (150 mL) is added slowly via the dropping funnel, causing a slight exotherm, followed by the addition of 100 mL of n-heptane. The resulting mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of n-heptane. The combined organic phases are washed with 100 mL of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C/10 mmHg). The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on 100 g of silica gel packed in a 4.5 × 38 cm column. Elution with n-heptane (650 mL) followed by 2% ethyl acetate in n-heptane (about 1 L) provides 22.5 g (91 %) of 2,3-dihydro-2-tert-butyldimethysiloxy-1H-indene as a colorless oil.
In a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) are placed 400 g. (4 moles) of cyclohexanol and 12 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the flask is connected to a condenser and receiver surrounded by an ice bath. It is then placed in an oil bath which is heated to a temperature of 130–140°. The distillation is continued until only a small residue remains and the odor of sulfur dioxide is apparent. Toward the end of the distillation the temperature of the bath may be raised to 150°. The receiver is kept cold during the entire distillation, which requires from five to six hours.
While the third fraction is distilling, the aqueous layer in fraction II is separated in a separatory funnel and the crude mesityl oxide is dried with anhydrous calcium chloride and distilled through a Glinsky column; by this means a further amount of acetone and a small intermediate fraction (85-126°), which is best discarded, are separated. The pure mesityl oxide itself then distils between 126° and 130° and is added to the pure product already obtained as the third portion of the first distillation. The first complete distillation will require about five hours; the redistillation of portion III will take about one hour. The yield is 650 g. (65 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the total acetone employed). About 300 g. of acetone is recovered.
For further purification the product is dissolved in a solution of 140 g. (3.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water and steam-distilled from a 2-l. flask until a test portion of the distillate is free of oil. The solution remaining in the flask is cooled to room temperature and acidified with 375 cc. (4.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The heptanoic acid is separated and distilled from a Claisen flask with fractionating side arm. The recovery of acid boiling at 155–157°/80 mm. is 85–90 per cent of the weight of impure material used. Titration indicates it to be 100 per cent pure.
A mixture of 14.6 g. (0.07 mole) of ruthenium trichloride and 2.4 g. (0.024 g. atom) of ruthenium metal is added, and the reaction mixture is heated and stirred under nitrogen for 80 hours at slightly below the reflux temperature. With the use of stirring, the solvent is removed at aspirator pressure, and the flask then refilled with nitrogen. The solid is transferred to a sublimator in a dry-box containing a nitrogen atmosphere and sublimed at 0.1 mm. pressure with a heating bath at 130°. The sublimate is dissolved in benzene and passed through a 1 × 12-in. column of activated alumina. Evaporation of the benzene gives 12.2–15.1 g. (56–69%) of ruthenocene, m.p. 199–200°.
The p-toluyl-o-benzoic acid which is obtained from 100 g. of phthalic anhydride (p. 517), and which should weigh 157 g. (0.65 mole), is mixed with 1400 g. (725 cc.) of fuming sulfuric acid (20 per cent anhydride) in a 2-l. flask protected by a calcium chloride tube, and the mixture is heated on the steam bath for two hours with occasional shaking. The clear, deep red solution is poured when cold upon cracked ice in a 4-l. beaker. The methyl anthraquinone separates and is digested for twenty minutes by passing in steam, after which it is filtered by suction. A flannel cloth is used in the filter, or a filtros plate may be cemented into a Büchner funnel with water-glass. The precipitate is washed well with hot water, after which it is returned to the beaker and digested as before with hot water to which is added a slight excess of ammonia, beyond that required to neutralize any acid present.
A dry, 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 11 ml. of a solution containing 0.01 mole of sodium deuteroxide in 10 ml. of deuterium oxide and 1 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. After the solution has been cooled in an ice bath, 120 ml. of the ethereal solution containing 0.039 mole of diazomethane is added, the flask is stoppered loosely with a cork, and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at 0° for one hour. The lower deuterium oxide layer is removed with a pipette and a fresh 11-ml. portion of the sodium deuteroxide solution is added. This mixture is then stirred for one hour at 0°, and the process is repeated until a total of four exchanges have been performed. The ethereal diazomethane solution is then decanted into a clean, dry, 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask and dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate. The resulting solution (approximately 110 ml.) contains (spectrophotometric analysis,, or titration with benzoic acid,) 0.020–0.022 mole (51–56%) of dideuteriodiazomethane, which is 98–99% deuterated.
A. (S)-(-)-2-(N-3,5-Diiodosalicyliden)amino-3,3-dimethyl-1-butanol [(S)-1]: To a solution of (L)-(+)-tert-leucinol (350 mg, 3.0 mmol, 1.13 equiv) dissolved in 15 mL of MeOH in a flame-dried 50-mL round-bottomed flask kept under positive nitrogen pressure during the reaction is added 3,5-diiodosalicylaldehyde (1.00 g, 2.66 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature (25 °C) for 48 h. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure (30 °C, 40 mmHg) and the crude product is transferred to a 25-mL Erlenmeyer flask and purified by dissolving in 5 mL of hot EtOH. The resulting yellow solution is allowed to reach room temperature slowly over a two-hour period (25 °C), allowing partial solvent evaporation (~1 mL), and needle crystal formation is observed. At this point, the Erlenmeyer flask is plugged and left overnight (17 h) in a refrigerator at 3 °C. The crystals are filtered in a Büchner funnel and washed with ice-cold EtOH (3 × 2 mL), and then dried under vacuum (0.02 mmHg) to afford the ligand (S)-1 as a yellow solid (1.04 g, 82% yield).
A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a distillation head with a thermometer and efficient Liebig condenser is charged with 1.4 l. of xylene. The xylene is stirred and heated to boiling with a heating mantle, while 179 g. of a solution containing 43 g. (0.80 mole) of sodium methoxide in methyl alcohol is added over 20 minutes. During this period 450 ml. of solvent is distilled.
Work-up is initiated by extracting the reaction mixture with three 50-ml. portions of 1 N hydrochloric acid, three 50-ml. portions of aqueous 1 N potassium hydrogen carbonate and, and 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Purification of the residue by bulb-to-bulb distillation at about 140° (5 mm.) provides 1.77–1.98 g. (85–95%) of ethyl 4-acetoxybenzoate as a colorless, viscous liquid.
Sixty grams (0.43 mole) of potassium carbonate is slowly stirred into a mixture of 100 g. (0.725 mole) of u.s.p. salicylic acid and 150 cc. of water contained in a 20-cm. porcelain dish. The solution is evaporated on a steam bath until a thick, pasty residue is obtained. This is broken up into small pieces and dried in an oven at 105–110° for two hours. The solid is then ground as finely as possible, dried for another two hours at 105–110°, and again ground to a fine powder.
After the reaction is complete the mixture is treated with ethyl acetate (250 mL) with stirring to dissolve the product. The resulting mixture is filtered through a 500-mL medium-fritted glass funnel and the flask and filter cake are washed with ethyl acetate (3 × 50 mL). The filtrate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and the brown-colored aqueous phase is separated. The organic phase is washed with 2 M potassium hydroxide (KOH, 2 × 50 mL) with vigorous shaking to remove methanesulfonamide , then dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4, 12.5 g). The solid is filtered, the cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 × 37 mL) and the filtrate is evaporated, to afford a white solid. After the crude product is dried under reduced pressure overnight, it weighs 47.44 g (99%).
A. 3β-Acetoxy-20β-hydroxy-5-pregnene. In a 2-l. five-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, 250-ml. dropping funnel, thermometer, nitrogen-inlet tube, and reflux condenser with calcium chloride tube is placed 750 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The vessel is flushed with nitrogen, and 101.6 g. (0.4 mole) of lithium aluminum tri-t-butoxyhydride2 is added. The suspension is cooled to about 2°, and 71.7 g. (0.2 mole) of pregnenolone acetate is added in one portion while stirring, the particles adhering to the wall of the flask being rinsed into the solution with an additional 50 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0–5° for 6 hours. A solution of 100 g. of ammonium sulfate in 150 ml. of water is added, with stirring, over a 15–20 minute period through the dropping funnel, the temperature of the reaction mixture being kept below 10° by efficient cooling with ice. A considerable quantity of hydrogen is evolved. There is added 20 g. of filter aid (Celite® or Hyflo Supercel®), the mixture is stirred for another 30 minutes, and it is finally filtered with suction through a layer of filter aid. The reaction vessel is rinsed and the filter residue thoroughly washed with 1.5 l. of tetrahydrofuran. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The crystalline residue is dissolved in 750 ml. of hot acetone, filtered (if necessary), and the solution is concentrated to a volume of about 200 ml. (crystallization may begin during this evaporation). The flask is kept overnight at 0° to −10° and the product isolated by suction filtration. The crystals are washed with 75 ml. of ice-cold acetone and dried at 60°. The yield of the product is 54–57 g. (75–79%), m.p. 161–164°,3 [α]25D −74° (c 1.0, CHCl3).
(C) p-Tolunitrile.—p-Tolunitrile can be prepared in exactly the same manner from p-toluidine; the product, which distils at 104–106°/20 mm., solidifies in the receiver to a mass of nearly colorless needles which melt at 25–27°. The yield is the same as with the ortho compound.
To 500 g. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in a 5-l. flask are added 170 g. (1.1 moles) of "m-nitro-p-toluidine" (3-nitro-4-aminotoluene, m.p. 112–114°,) and 250 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The solution is chilled to 10° by means of an ice bath, and a solution of 85 g. (1.2 moles) of technical sodium nitrite in the minimum quantity of water is slowly added, with stirring, the temperature being kept below 10°. The mixture is now warmed very gently on the water bath under an efficient reflux condenser (from the upper end of which a tube leads to a hood or through water) until evolution of gas ceases. The alcohol and aldehyde are then carefully distilled off, using a fractionating column and heating in an oil or brine bath; when the temperature of the vapors reaches 80° fractionation is stopped and the residue is distilled in a current of steam.
The flask is allowed to cool, and the contents are transferred to a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is cautiously neutralized with 2 l. of a 40% aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide. The mixture is steam-distilled until 3 l. of distillate is collected, after which the residue is discarded. The distillate, which separates into two layers, is saturated with 1.5–1.8 kg. of solid potassium carbonate. The organic layer is removed by decantation; the remaining water layer is divided into two portions, and each is extracted once with 150 ml. of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined with the organic layer.
3-Ethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-5-methylisoxazole (54 g., 0.38 mole) is dissolved in 70 ml. of dichloromethane and placed in a 500-ml., one-necked flask fitted with a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing addition funnel and a magnetic stirrer. The flask is placed in an ice bath, and its contents are stirred while a solution of 53 g. of thionyl chloride (32 ml., 0.45 mole) in 50 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise. Addition is complete in 1 hour, and the reaction is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for an additional hour. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator and the dark residual liquid is distilled, yielding 47–49 g. (78–81%) of 4-chloromethyl-3-ethyl-5-methylisoxazole, b.p. 77–78° (1.5 mm.); nD23 1.4845; IR: 1620, 680 cm.−1; 1H NMR (CCl4): δ 1.3 (t, 3H, CH2CH3), 2.3 (s, 3H, C=CCH3), 2.6 (q, 2H, CH2CH3), 4.3 (s, 2H, CH2Cl).
A. 3-Chloropropyldiphenylsulfonium tetrafluoroborate. A solution of 93.0 g. (0.500 mole) of diphenyl sulfide and and 347 g. (1.70 mole) of 1-chloro-3-iodopropane,, and in 200 ml. of nitromethane in a 1-l., one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a nitrogen inlet tube is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen. The flask is shielded from light, and 78 g. (0.40 mole) of silver tetrafluoroborate is added in one portion. Initially the temperature rises to 40°, then gradually falls to room temperature. No external cooling is necessary. After 16 hours 200 ml. of dichloromethane is added, the mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel fitted with a 35 g. pad of Florisil, and the solid is washed with 100 ml. of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane portions are combined and evaporated at reduced pressure until a solid separates; 1 l. of diethyl ether is added to precipitate the product. The off-white crystals are collected, washed with ether, and dried under reduced pressure at 25°, yielding 122–140 g. (87–99%) of the sulfonium salt, m.p. 103–105°.
The tryptophane is extracted from the aqueous solution by repeated shaking in a separatory funnel with 25-cc. quantities of n-butyl alcohol; water is added from time to time to keep the volume approximately constant. The butyl alcohol extract is distilled under reduced pressure. After the water present has distilled, the tryptophane precipitates in the distilling flask and may cause bumping. When all the water has been removed, as is indicated by non-formation of drops on the side of the condenser, the distillation is stopped and, after cooling, the tryptophane is filtered and washed with a little fresh butyl alcohol. Such extractions and distillations are continued until the quantities of tryptophane obtained are negligibly small.
The furnace is heated to 430–450°, and simultaneously the tube is swept out thoroughly with a stream of carbon dioxide, introduced through the side arm C. The carbon dioxide is passed through a wash bottle of concentrated sulfuric acid to dry it and to estimate the rate of flow. A solution of 136 g. (1 mole) of phenylacetic acid, m.p. 77–79° (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), in 120 cc. (120 g., 2 moles) of glacial acetic acid is placed in the separatory funnel E and is introduced into the inlet chamber B at the rate of twelve to fifteen drops per minute. The entire solution should run through in twelve to fifteen hours. Meanwhile a very slow stream of carbon dioxide (one bubble per second) is passed through the tube C, to keep the gases in motion. After all the solution has been added, the funnel is rinsed with 10 cc. of glacial acetic acid, and this is passed through the reaction tube to facilitate removal of the product. The distillate consists of a slightly fluorescent light brown oil and an aqueous layer; both layers are treated with 300 g. of a mixture of ice and water, and rendered alkaline to litmus with a slight excess of 50 per cent sodium hydroxide solution.
A solution of bromine is prepared by dissolving 103 g. (1 mole) of sodium bromide and 160 g. (50.2 cc., 1 mole) of bromine in 150 cc. of water. The mixture is stirred, and the bromine solution is added as rapidly as possible through the shaft of the stirrer. The precipitate dissolves. The solution is heated to boiling for five minutes after the last of the bromine has been added. The solution is then made slightly alkaline by the addition of 20 g. (0.5 mole) of solid sodium hydroxide and filtered through a fluted filter. The filtrate is then made acid to Congo red, using about 150 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The precipitated 2-bromo-3-nitrobenzoic acid is filtered with suction and sucked as dry as possible. It is then crystallized from 1 l. of hot 30 per cent alcohol. The yield of product melting at 185–187° is 130–150 g. (53–61 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the 3-nitrophthalic acid used). About 25 g. of material melting at about 175° can be recovered from the mother liquor.
A. N,N'-Diethylsulfamide. A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, and protected from atmospheric moisture with calcium chloride drying tubes is charged with 500 ml. of petroleum ether, 100 g. (2.20 moles) of ethylamine, and 140 g. (1.76 moles) of pyridine. The stirred mixture is cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath to −30° to −15°; a solution of 120 g. (0.889 mole) of sulfuryl chloride in 220 ml. of petroleum ether is added, dropwise and with stirring, to the reaction flask at such a rate that the temperature remains below −15°. After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for one hour. The petroleum ether layer is separated and discarded. The dark semisolid residue is made acidic by addition of 6 M hydrochloric acid, and the acidic mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours. The resulting solution is extracted with diethyl ether in a continuous extractor until all of the diethylsulfamide has dissolved. The ether is evaporated using a rotary evaporator, yielding 58–61 g.. (44–45%) of crude N,N'-diethylsulfamide, m.p. 65–67°, which is of sufficient purity for use in the next step.
A stir bar is added to the flask and the solids are suspended in 150 mL of toluene with mixing at approximately 400 rpm. After a water-cooled reflux condenser is attached to the flask, the mixture is then heated to 110 °C (bath temperature) in an oil bath. After a few minutes at this temperature, the solids dissolve completely to afford a clear colorless solution. Heating is discontinued and the stirred mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature (20 °C) overnight while still immersed in the oil bath. The cooled heterogeneous mixture is vacuum filtered (water aspirator) through filter paper on a porcelain Büchner funnel. The solids are rinsed with toluene (2 × 10 mL) and then dried on the filter for 15 min. The solids are transferred to a 250-mL pear-shaped flask and dried under vacuum (0.3 mmHg) until a constant mass of 10.8–10.9 g (51.7–52.2 mmol, 76–77% yield, 89–90% recovery) is observed. This material is found to have 98–99% enantiomeric excess (measured by reverting to the ketone, Note 20).
A. 1,3-Bis(methylthio)-2-propanol. A solution of 44 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of methanol is placed in a 1-l., four-necked flask equipped with a dry ice reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a gas-inlet, and an ice bath. While the solution is stirred and cooled, 50 g. (56 ml., 1.0 mole) of methanethiol is distilled from a lecture bottle into the solution at such a rate that the temperature is maintained below 20°. The gas-inlet is then replaced with a 60-ml., glass-stoppered, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and, while the reaction mixture is stirred and cooled, 44.4 g. (37.6 ml., 0.480 mole) of epichlorohydrin is added dropwise at such a rate that the temperature is maintained below 50°.
B. Δα,β-Butenolide. In a 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel containing a solution of 61 g. (84.5 ml., 0.6 mole) of triethylamine in 70 ml. of dry diethyl ether, a solution of 83 g. (0.5 mole) of α-bromo-γ-butyrolactone and 200 ml. of dry diethyl ether is heated to reflux, with stirring. The amine solution is added, slowly, during 5 hours and the stirring under reflux continued for an additional 24 hours. The brown precipitate (40 g.) is removed by filtration. Most of the solvent is removed from the filtrate by evaporation, and the additional precipitate (8 g.) is removed. This precipitate is predominantly triethylamine hydrobromide. The liquid residue is distilled under reduced pressure and the Δα,β-butenolide is collected at 107–109° (24 mm.); yield 25 g. (60%, 33% overall), m.p. 5°2,3,4.
A solution of 270 g. (4.8 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 150 cc. of water is prepared in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, 120 g. (0.5 mole) of crude 2,4-dimethyl-3,5-dicarbethoxypyrrole (p. 202) and a pinch of sand are added, and the whole is mixed thoroughly by shaking. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 130° for two to three hours with occasional shaking until the thick paste has become partially liquefied owing to the formation of dimethylpyrrole.
A 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing the hydrobromic acid-cuprous bromide solution, is arranged for steam distillation. After the copper solution is heated to boiling, the diazonium solution is gradually added from a separatory funnel and a vigorous current of steam is passed through the reaction mixture at the same time. This procedure requires about two hours.
The silver nitrate solution is extracted as described above with three portions of n-pentane to remove cis-cyclooctene. The aqueous silver nitrate solution is added slowly to 300 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide containing cracked ice. The hydrocarbon that separates is extracted with 300 ml. of n-pentane as described above and the pentane solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the pentane distilled through a 23 × 250 mm. column packed with glass beads.
C. (R)-4-Ethyl-4-allyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one. In an oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, containing dry toluene (300 mL) and a magnetic stirring bar, is placed the dialkylated lactam (7.8 g, 23.7 mmol). The solution is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath and a 1 M solution of Red-Al in toluene (55 mL, 55.0 mmol) is slowly added. The flask is flushed with argon and sealed with a rubber septum which is connected by a hypodermic needle to a rubber balloon filled with argon. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 3 days. The septum is removed, the reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C, and methanol (10 mL) is cautiously added with stirring to destroy excess Red-Al. The solution is poured over 1 M aqueous potassium hydroxide (500 mL) in a 2-L separatory funnel and thoroughly shaken with ether (200 mL) until both layers become almost clear. The aqueous layer is extracted twice more with ether (2 × 100 mL), and, after the ethereal layers are combined, the ethereal solution is dried over magnesium sulfate and evaporated to dryness in a 500-mL flask.
The benzene and unchanged tert-butyl alcohol are removed by distillation from the steam bath, the final traces being removed under 10–30 mm. pressure. A liter of dry ether is added, and the solid aluminum tert-butoxide is dissolved by refluxing for a short period. After cooling, 35 ml. of undried ether is added, followed immediately by vigorous shaking. After standing for 2 hours the solution is centrifuged for 30 minutes to remove unused aluminum, aluminum hydroxide, and mercury.
B. (1S)-1-(4-Nitrophenyl)-2-nitroethane-1-ol (4). A 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 2 × 1 cm) is charged with 2-(1,1-dimethylethyl)-6-[[[(1R,2R)-2-[(4-pyridinylmethyl)-amino]cyclohexyl]amino]methyl]-phenol (2, 606 mg, 1.65 mmol, 5.7 mol%), copper acetate (273 mg, 1.47 mmol, 5.1 mol%) and 30 mL of ethanol. Within minutes the reaction mixture becomes deep green. After stirring for 45 min at 23 °C to complete the formation of the Cu(II) complex 3,2 solid p-nitrobenzaldehyde (4.48 g, 29.1 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and nitromethane (16.2 mL, 18.3 g, 295 mmol, 10 equiv) are added. Stirring is continued for an additional 3 h. The deep green solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 °C water bath, 24 mmHg) to give 8.01 g of a dark green solid (92% ee). The residue is dissolved in 4.4 mL of methanol and immediately purified by column chromatography. Fractions containing the product are combined in a 50-mL round-bottomed flask, concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 °C water bath, 24 mmHg) and dissolved in a minimal amount of methanol (4.4 mL, dissolution aided by use of ultrasound). To facilitate the crystallization the flask is placed in a refrigerator (3 °C, 5 h) and freezer (-20 °C, 12 h). The mother liquor is removed with a pasteur pipette and the yellowish crystals are washed with cold dichloromethane (taken from the freezer; 3 × 0.5 mL), which is removed each time with a Pasteur pipette, and dried (23 °C, 0.2 mmHg) to provide product 4 (4.24 g, 69% yield, 95% ee). The mother liquor is concentrated by rotary evaporation (21 °C water bath, 8 mmHg), layered with dichloromethane (ca. 0.5 mL) and cooled (3 °C, 2 h then -20 °C, 24 h). The mother liquor is removed with a pasteur pipette and the yellowish crystals are washed with cold dichloromethane (taken from the freezer; 3 × 0.5 mL), which is again removed each time with a Pasteur pipette, and dried (23 °C, 0.2 mmHg) to give a second crop of yellow crystals (0.77 g, 12% yield, 94% ee). The two crops were combined to provide (1S)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-nitroethane-1-ol (4) (5.01 g, 81% yield, 95% ee).
A solution of 379.5 g. (3 moles) of benzyl chloride dissolved in 750 g. of anhydrous ethanol is placed in flask B. The system is flushed with trimethylamine previously dried by passage through a soda-lime tower. The gas outlet is closed and connected to the manometer. Over a period of 80 minutes, 195 g. (3.3 moles) of trimethylamine is introduced with stirring. The reaction is exothermic and must be cooled to keep the temperature below 50°. After the amine addition is complete, the solution is kept at 50° under an amine pressure of 5 cm. of mercury above atmospheric pressure for 1 hour. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature under an amine atmosphere.
(B) Phosphorus Oxychloride Method.—Benzenesulfonyl chloride may be prepared by the same procedure described above from a mixture of 270 g. (1.5 moles) of sodium benzenesulfonate and 180 g. (1.17 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride. It is advisable to observe the same precaution of shaking every few hours. The yield of product boiling at 145–150° /45 mm. is 195–230 g. (74–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a low-temperature thermometer, and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The flask is charged with 30.0 g (0.234 mol) of 3-trimethylsilyl-2-propyn-1-ol and 230 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and then cooled with an ice bath while 84 mL of a 2.8 M solution of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran is added at such a rate that the internal temperature does not rise above 10°C. Approximately 1.5 hr is required for the addition, after which time the gray solution is stirred at 0°C for 30 min, and then cooled below −70°C with a dry ice–acetone bath. Methanesulfonyl chloride (26.8 g, 0.234 mol) is added over 10 min via syringe, and after 30 min the cold bath is removed and the pale-yellow reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2 hr.
(B) Reduction of Dinitrodurene.—A solution of 90 g. of dinitrodurene in 1 l. of glacial acetic acid is boiled in a 12-l. flask; 700 g. of stannous chloride is dissolved in 800 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated to boiling. The heat is removed from the acetic acid solution of the nitro compound, and the stannous chloride solution is poured very carefully (during about ten minutes) into the dinitrodurene solution. The reaction is complete in fifteen minutes, and, as the solution cools, the stannic chloride compound of the diamine begins to crystallize. The reaction mixture is cooled to 10° in an ice-water bath, and the solid is filtered by suction, washed twice with 50 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and twice with 50 cc. of ether, and dried. The filtrates from the tin compound contain very little of the reduction product and may be discarded. The composition of this compound is [C6(CH3)4(NH2·HCl)2]2·SnCl4, and it crystallizes from the reaction mixture in fine, glistening plates which are almost colorless. The yield is 145 g. (97 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer is placed 500 g. (3.5 moles) of technical β-naphthol dissolved in a warm solution of 140 g. (3.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 6 l. of water. The solution is cooled to 0° in an ice and salt bath, and 250 g. (3.5 moles) of powdered technical sodium nitrite is added. Stirring is started, and 1100 g. (833 cc., 4.6 moles) of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.32) is added from a dropping funnel at such a rate that the whole is added in one to one and one-half hours, the temperature being kept at 0°. During the reaction, crushed ice is added from time to time to maintain the temperature at 0°; about 1 kg. is generally used. After all the sulfuric acid has been added, the solution should react acid to Congo red paper. The mixture is stirred one hour longer at the low temperature, and then the nitroso-β-naphthol, which has gradually separated during the reaction, is filtered with suction and washed thoroughly with water. The product is at first light yellow in color, but after three to four days it gradually changes to a dark brown. The moisture content seems to have some effect on the color.
C. (−)-2-O-Benzyl-L-glyceraldehyde.3 A solution of 9.22 g (43.4 mmol) of (+)-2-O-benzyl-L-threitol in 100 mL of water is stirred vigorously, while 9.28 g (43.4 mmol) of sodium periodate is added in ca. 1-g portions over 40 min. The mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature, then the pH is adjusted to 7.0 by addition of solid potassium carbonate. The mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 150 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate for 15 min and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 mm, 30°C). The remaining pale-yellow crude oil is transferred to a 25-mL round-bottomed flask and purified by short-path distillation in a preheated oil bath (0.025 mm, 160°C), to yield 6.32 g (80%) of (−)-2-O-benzyl-L-glyceraldehyde, a colorless oil that on standing turns more and more viscous, and after several weeks at room temperature forms a waxy solid.
The oily filtrate combined with the concentrated mother liquors of the above recrystallization is dissolved in 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide and extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether to remove non-phenolic products. The alkaline solution is acidified with hydrochloric acid and the oily layer is separated, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled. The o-propiophenol boils at 110–115°/6 mm. The yield is 120–132 g. (32–35 per cent of the theoretical amount). About 40 g. of p-propiophenol boiling at 135–150°/11 mm. is obtained. The total yield of crude p-propiophenol is thus 169–188 g. (45–50 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, wrapped with aluminum foil to exclude light, and equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and an addition funnel, is suspended 37 g. (0.17 mole) of red mercury(II) oxide in 330 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. To the flask is added 30.0 g. (0.227 mole) of 3-chlorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid. With stirring, the mixture is heated to reflux before a solution of 40 g. (0.25 mole) of bromine in 180 ml. of carbon tetrachloride is added dropwise, but as fast as possible (4–7 minutes) without loss of bromine from the condenser. After a short induction period, carbon dioxide is evolved at a rate of 150–200 bubbles per minute. The solution is allowed to reflux for 25–30 minutes, until the rate of carbon dioxide evolution slows to about 5 bubbles per minute. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the precipitate is removed by filtration. The residue is washed with carbon tetrachloride, and the filtrates are combined. The solvent is removed by distillation using a modified Claisen distillation apparatus with a 6-cm. Vigreux column; vacuum distillation of the residual oil gives 13–17 g. (35–46%) of 1-bromo-3-chlorocyclobutane, b.p. 67–72° (45 mm.), n23D 1.5065 and.
A. Methyl 2-(1-acetamido-4-oxocyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-yl)acetate (2). An oven-dried (110 °C), three-necked, 1-L round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1.25-inch egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and three rubber septa, one containing a temperature probe and another a nitrogen inlet. Solid (diacetoxyiodo)benzene ("DIB," 23.9 g, 74.2 mmol, 1.35 equiv) is added under purging N2 followed by CH3CN (480 mL). The flask is purged for 5 min and the contents are maintained under inert atmosphere during all subsequent operations. The stirrer is set to 560 rpm and neat trifluoroacetic acid (TFA, 6.4 mL, 83.6 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is carefully added via syringe over 3 min at room temperature, whereupon the mixture becomes homogeneous.
B. Alloxan monohydrate. A mixture of 730 ml. of acetic acid, 95 ml. of water, and 162 g. (1.62 moles) of chromium trioxide is placed in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a thermometer; the stirrer is started, and the mixture is warmed to 50°. To the solution 180 g. (0.83 mole) of benzalbarbituric acid is added in small portions during the course of 30 minutes, a cold water bath being used to maintain the temperature at 50–60°. After all the acid has been added, stirring is continued and the temperature maintained at 50–60° by a warm water bath for another 30 minutes to complete the reaction. Alloxan monohydrate generally starts to crystallize from the warm solution. The mixture is cooled to 15° and filtered. The product is washed on the filter with cold glacial acetic acid until the washings are no longer green, and then is dried by washing with ether. The yield is 105–112 g. (79–84%) of yellow crystals which melt at about 254° with decomposition and are sufficiently pure for most purposes.
The tryptophane is precipitated by adding a solution of 200 g. of mercuric sulfate in a mixture of 1860 cc. of water and 140 cc. of 95 per cent sulfuric acid. After standing for twenty-four to forty-eight hours, the clear liquid is siphoned out and the yellow precipitate is filtered and washed with a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.9 l. of distilled water containing 20 g. of mercuric sulfate, until the filtrate is colorless and Millon's test is atypical; about 1.5 l. is necessary. The precipitate is washed with three successive 500-cc. portions of distilled water to remove most of the sulfuric acid.
One hundred fifty grams (1.8 moles) of pure cyanoacetamide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 179) is thoroughly mixed in a large (20-cm.) mortar with 150 g. (0.7 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride. This mixture is transferred as quickly as possible to a 1-l. Claisen flask equipped with a 360° thermometer and an air-intake tube. The Claisen flask is connected by means of a double-length air condenser to a 250-cc. filter flask which in turn is connected to a water pump through a manometer.
A similar reaction of myrcene with dipropylamine (50°C, 20 hr) afforded N,N-dipropylgeranylamine (80%; bp 93–94°C, 1 mm).
In a 3-l. beaker, 110 g. (0.8 mole) of anthranilic acid is dissolved in 1 l. of water and 80 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19); the solution is cooled to 20°. In a 2-l. beaker a solution of iodine monochloride in hydrochloric acid is prepared by diluting 140 cc. of c.p. concentrated hydrochloric acid with 500 cc. of cold water, adding just sufficient crushed ice to bring the temperature to 5°, and, during about two minutes, stirring in 131 g. (0.8 mole) of iodine monochloride (p. 197).
The crude primary amine (138–149 g.) is distilled over the range 75–110°/21 mm., and the crude secondary amine (213–226 g.) in the range 130–150°/1 mm. The primary amine, b.p. 79–81°/16 mm. or 87–89°/20 mm. (nD20 1.3496), after refractionation, is obtained in a yield of 130–140 g. (31–33%). The secondary amine, b.p. 134–135°/1 mm. (nD20 1.4640), is obtained in a yield of about 210 g. (57%).
C. 2,2-Diethoxy-2-(4-pyridyl)ethylamine. To a 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing 80 mL of absolute ethanol and fitted with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser with a drying tube, potassium metal (7.60 g, 0.19 mol) is slowly added. When the metal has dissolved, the solution is cooled to 0–5°C and (E)-4-acetylpyridine tosylate (55.1 g, 0.19 mol) dissolved (with gentle warming) in 320 mL of absolute ethanol is added over 15 min through a dropping funnel to the stirred solution at 0–5°C. During this period a precipitate of potassium p-toluenesulfonate forms. The temperature of the stirred mixture is allowed to rise to room temperature for 1 hr. The mixture is diluted with 1 L of anhydrous ether and filtered by suction. The precipitate is quickly washed with 150 mL of anhydrous ether. The ether filtrates are combined, and hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the ether solution for 15 min. A precipitate forms immediately. The precipitate is collected by suction filtration, washed with three 170-mL portions of anhydrous ether, and dried briefly under reduced pressure. The dihydrochloride thus obtained is dissolved in 200 mL of water, and powdered sodium carbonate is added until the mixture reaches a pH of >10. The mixture is extracted four times with 125-mL portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure to an oil. This orange–red oil is distilled at 0.2 mm to yield 29.7 g (74.5%) of the amine as a colorless oil, bp 93–95°C.
Ethyl Propane-1,1,3,3-tetracarboxylate.—To a mixture of 1600 g. (1510 cc., 10 moles) of ethyl malonate and 400 g. of 40 percent formalin (5.3 moles) in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, cooled to 5° by immersion in ice, is added 25 g. (35 cc.) of diethylamine. The mixture is then allowed to come to room temperature and remain for fifteen hours, after which the flask is heated under a reflux condenser on a boiling water bath for six hours. The aqueous layer is then separated, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure from a 3-l. special Claisen flask (p. 130). The ester distils at 190–200°/12 mm. (210–215° /20 mm.). The yield is 1000 g. (61 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The dark mixture is then transferred to a 500-ml. distilling flask fitted with a 15.2-cm. modified Vigreux column and the unchanged acrylonitrile (17–20 g.) collected at 100 mm. (water pump). The distillation is continued (vacuum pump) and the unchanged o-chloroaniline (110–120 g.), b.p. 57–60°/0.5 mm., is recovered. The 3-(o-chloroanilino) propionitrile (182–192 g.) is obtained as a colorless, somewhat viscous liquid, b.p. 139–141°/0.3 mm., nD25 1.5728–1.5735.
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and Hershberg stirrer, are placed 256 g. (2 moles) of naphthalene, 110 g. of paraformaldehyde, 260 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 165 ml. of 85% phosphoric acid, and 428 g. (362 ml., 4.2 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid. This mixture is heated in a water bath at 80–85° and vigorously stirred for 6 hours.
The tryptophane so produced (7–8 g.) varies somewhat in quality in different runs. It is purified by recrystallization from 60 cc. of dilute alcohol (two volumes of 95 per cent alcohol to one volume of water), filtering from the hot solution an appreciable quantity of insoluble matter, and subjecting this to a second extraction with an additional 10 cc. of aqueous alcohol. The solution is decolorized by the addition of 1 g. of Norite and allowed to stand in the icebox; the silvery leaflets of tryptophane are filtered and washed successively with cold 70 per cent, 80 per cent, 95 per cent alcohol, and, finally, with a little ether. Less than half the tryptophane is obtained in each crystallization. The yield of pure tryptophane is 4.0–4.1 g., together with under 0.1 g. of less pure product.
The mixture is then cooled by means of an ice-sodium chloride bath. When the internal temperatures has reached −7°, a solution of 71.8 g. (0.33 mole) of chlorodiphenylphosphine in 100 ml. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the internal temperature does not exceed +10°. The addition requires about 1.25 hours. The cooling bath is then removed and stirring continued for 1.5 hours. The flask is then again immersed in an icesodium chloride bath, and 150 ml. of a cold saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added slowly. The ether is decanted and the remainder acidified with hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with 125 ml. of benzene each. From the combined ether and benzene solutions, the solvents are evaporated and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. After the low-boiling material, some p-dibromobenzene distills and crystallizes in the distillation bridge. At 2 × 10−2 mm., heating is continued until the phosphine reaches the stillhead. At this stage the distillation is interrupted, the stillhead and condenser containing p-dibromobenzene replaced by a clean, short distillation bridge without condenser, and the phosphine distilled at 2 × 10−2 to 10−3 mm., no forerun being taken. The main bulk distills at 180–185° (2 × 10−2 mm.). The colorless, oily distillate begins to crystallize in the receiving flask during or shortly after the distillation and weighs 81–83 g. (73–77% yield), m.p. 64–71°. This material is sufficiently pure for further reactions, e.g., Grignard reaction. A sample may be recrystallized from methanol to give colorless needles, m.p. 79–80°.
In a 200-cc. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, are placed 50 g. (0.33 mole) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde, 40 g. (0.48 mole) of freshly fused sodium acetate, and 70 g. (0.68 mole) of acetic anhydride. The contents of the flask are well mixed and the mixture heated in an oil bath held at 180° for about thirteen hours. After the reaction product has been allowed to cool slightly, it is poured into 200–300 cc. of water and then filtered by suction. After the solid has been washed several times with water, it is dissolved in a solution of 20 cc. of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) in about 200 cc. of water. The solution of the ammonium salt, after filtering, is poured into a solution of 15 cc. of sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in about 200 cc. of water. The precipitated m-nitrocinnamic acid is filtered, redissolved in aqueous ammonia, and again precipitated by pouring the solution into dilute sulfuric acid.
A. 2,2,4,4-Tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithietane. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a good magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, water-cooled condenser, and a fritted gas inlet tube. The outlet of the condenser is attached to a tared −78°C cold trap and the inlet tube is connected via flexible tubing to a graduated −78°C cold trap into which 60 mL (96 g, 0.64 mol) of hexafluoropropene has been condensed under nitrogen. The flask is charged with 3 g of potassium fluoride and is flamed gently under vacuum. The apparatus is cooled while purging with nitrogen. Sulfur (23 g, 0.72 mol) and 200 mL of dry dimethylformamide are then added. The reaction mixture is heated to 40–45°C with stirring. The heat source is removed, the stopcock on the trap containing the hexafluoropropene is opened, and the trap is gently thawed. The rate of hexafluoropropene bubbling into the reaction mixture is adjusted to about 0.6 mL (1 g) / min by cooling or warming the trap containing the hexafluoropropene,(Note 4),(Note 5). When all the hexafluoropropene has been added, the reaction mixture is cooled to −20°C to −30°C and quickly filtered under suction. The filtercake is transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask and is allowed to melt. Water (50 mL) is added, and the mixture is filtered. The lower liquid phase is separated, washed with 50 mL of water, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure to give 93.0–99.4 g (80–85%) of product, bp 106–108°C.
A solution of 100 mg. (0.41 mmole) of 4,4'-dimethoxybibenzyl in 1.5 ml. of anhydrous dioxane was placed in a 10-ml. round-bottomed flask. To this was added 103 mg. (0.45 mmole) of 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ;) dissolved in 1.5 ml. of anhydrous dioxane. The flask was fitted with a reflux condenser and heated in an oil bath at 105° for 18 hours. The solution, which was initially deep green, became pale yellow as the hydroquinone crystallized out. The mixture was cooled, and the solid was filtered off. It was washed with 1 ml. of warm benzene followed by 6 ml. of warm chloroform, and dried at 100° to give 95 mg. (91%) of pure 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanohydroquinone. The filtrate and washings were combined and evaporated under reduced pressure. The semisolid residue was dissolved in 5 ml. of ethyl acetate and passed through a short column of neutral alumina (2.0 g.;). The column was eluted with 100 ml. of ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure left the crude product, which was recrystallized from 35 ml. of ethanol to give 82–84 mg. (83–85%) of trans-4,4'-dimethoxystilbene as colorless plates, m.p. 212–213.5°.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser are placed 2750 ml. of 95% ethanol and 609 g. (8.0 moles) of thiourea. The mixture is brought to the reflux temperature on a steam bath, and the refluxing solution is almost clear. The steam is turned off, and 751.5 g. (4.0 moles) of ethylene dibromide is added in one portion. Within 5 minutes a vigorous reaction ensues and ethylene diisothiuronium bromide separates from solution. The exothermic reaction is allowed to continue to completion without further application of heat. The isothiuronium salt is collected by filtration and dried. The salt melts with decomposition at 225–227° and weighs 1104 g. (81%).
C. 4-Phenylurazole. A 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 100 ml. of aqueous 4 M potassium hydroxide and 44.6 g. (0.200 mole) of 4-phenyl-1-carbethoxysemicarbazide. The suspension is warmed on a steam bath, the flask being swirled occasionally to wash the solid off the sides. After 1.5 hours most of the solid has dissolved, and the hot solution is filtered. After cooling to room temperature, the solution is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 33 ml. is required). The mixture is again cooled to room temperature and the precipitated 4-phenylurazole is isolated by suction filtration. The mother liquor is evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is extracted twice with 100-ml. portions of boiling absolute ethanol. The ethanol solutions are combined, filtered, and evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, and the additional 4-phenylurazole recovered is combined with that obtained above. The product is crystallized from 95% ethanol (about 80 ml.), yielding 30.0–33.5 g. (85–95%) of 4-phenylurazole, m.p. 209–210°; IR cm.−1 1685 and 3120,(Note 9), and.
(B) To the crude acetylmandelic acid still containing some acetyl chloride obtained as described above, is added 250 g. (149 cc., 2.1 moles) of thionyl chloride. The reaction starts at once without warming but it is necessary to reflux for four hours to complete the reaction. The excess thionyl chloride is then distilled and the residue distilled under reduced pressure. The yield is 115–120 g. (79–82 per cent of the theoretical amount) of almost colorless liquid boiling at 125–130°/10 mm. (150–155°/33 mm.).
About 40 ml. of 95% ethanol is added to the contents of the flask, and the butenolide is brought into suspension by thoroughly breaking up all lumps with a spatula. The suspension is filtered with suction, and the filter cake is washed with 30 ml. of cold 95% ethanol and then with 100 ml. of boiling water to remove any sodium acetate present. The butenolide is obtained as a yellow solid, m.p. 149–154°, weight 11.1–12.4 g. (45–50%), after being dried overnight in a vacuum desiccator. This product, which is pure enough for most purposes, may be further purified by crystallization from 95% ethanol.
A. Ethyl 3-(1-azetidinyl)propionate. A solution of 150 g. (2.00 moles) of 3-amino-1-propanol in 500 g. (5.00 moles) of ethyl acrylate is refluxed for 2 hours in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask. Subsequent vacuum removal of the excess ethyl acrylate at steam temperature yields 548 g.. (99%) of crude diethyl 3-N-(3-hydroxypropyl)iminodipropionate. A stirred, cooled solution of this material (548 g.) in 1 l. of chloroform and 10 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide is treated dropwise with 262 g. 2.20 moles) of thionyl chloride. By cooling with an ice bath and controlling the addition rate, the reaction temperature is maintained below 40°. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature and poured slowly into a slurry of 340 g. of sodium hydrogen carbonate in 1 l. of water. The organic layer is separated and dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, below 50°, yielding 570 g. (97%) of crude diethyl 3-N-(3-chloropropyl)iminodipropionate. A mixture of 100 g. of this crude material, 200 g. of anhydrous, powdered sodium carbonate, and 10.0 g. of pentaerythritol in 200 ml. of diethyl phthalate is placed in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a vacuum-distillation head and an effective stirrer. The system is evacuated through a trap of sufficient capacity to contain 50 ml. of liquid, and the product is distilled by heating the stirred suspension with a heating mantle at 10–15 mm. By proper adjustment of the heat source, the distillation temperature is maintained below 150°, minimizing codistillation of diethyl phthalate. The distillate is collected until the head temperature cannot be kept below 150°. Redistillation of the resulting crude product through a 4-in. Vigreux column yields 34.0 g. (57–68%) of ethyl 3-(1-azetidinyl)propionate, b.p. 86–87° (12 mm.), 99% pure by GC.
To 200 ml. of redistilled technical grade dimethylformamide in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask are added 150 g. (1 mole) of sodium iodide and 40.5 g. (0.2 mole) of 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the red-brown mixture is refluxed for 15 minutes over a free flame arranged to impinge somewhat off-center.
In a 3-l., three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser and an efficient stirrer is placed 1 l. of absolute (99.8%) ethanol. To this is added 39.4 g. (1.72 g. atom) of sodium, and, after solution is complete, 91.5 ml. (97.2 g., 0.86 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate and 51.5 g. (0.86 mole) of urea are added. The mixture is heated under reflux on a steam bath with vigorous stirring for 4 hours. After about 2 hours, the reaction mixture becomes practically solid, and the stirrer may have to be stopped. At the end of the reaction time, 1 l. of hot (80°) water is added to the reaction mixture, and stirring is resumed. After complete solution has taken place, the stirred mixture is heated at 80° for 15 minutes and is then neutralized to litmus with glacial acetic acid. Additional glacial acetic acid (75 ml.) is added, followed by cautious addition of a solution of 64.8 g. (0.94 mole) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 70 ml. of water. The rose-red nitroso compound separates almost immediately as an expanded precipitate which almost stops the stirrer. After a few minutes the nitroso compound is removed by filtration and washed twice with a small amount of ice water. The moist material is transferred back to the 3-l. flask, and 430 ml. of warm water (50°) is added.
A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with a stirring bar, a rubber stopper, a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a three-way stopcock that is equipped with a balloon of argon gas. The flask is charged with 140 mL of dry methylene chloride and cooled in an ice bath. Titanium tetrachloride (11.0 mL) is added by a syringe with stirring by a magnetic stirrer, and a solution of 6.5 g of acetone in 30 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise over a 5-min period. On completion of this addition a solution of 19.2 g of acetophenone trimethylsilyl enol ether in 15 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise over a 10-min period, and the mixture is stirred for 15 min.
B. N,N-Dimethylhomoveratrylamine . An oven-dried, 100-mL, Erlenmeyer flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar, and charged with 9.05 g (0.041 mol) of 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine and 37 mL of methanol. The solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath and 1.87 g (0.049 mol, 1.2 equiv) of sodium borohydride is added with stirring in portions of ca. 0.1 g. The solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 4 hr, then poured with vigorous stirring into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of aqueous 30% sodium hydroxide and 100 mL of diethyl ether . The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 75-mL portions of diethyl ether . The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate and filtered through a sintered glass funnel. The solid residue is washed with 20 mL of diethyl ether . The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated by rotary evaporation followed by drying under reduced pressure (0.3 mm) for 1 hr to provide 7.9-8.1 g (93-95% yield) of N,N-dimethylhomoveratrylamine as a yellow oil. NMR and GC analysis indicate a purity greater than 95%.
The total yield is 90–110 g. (70–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 44–45°. If this material is steam-distilled and then repeatedly crystallized from petroleum ether (b.p. 20–40°) it is obtained as colorless crystals melting at 45.5° and.
In a 2-L, three-necked flask fitted with a condenser, mechanical stirrer, and a gas inlet tube is placed 90.0 g (0.66 mol) of ( − )-α-pinene. The flask is cooled to 0°C and under an inert atmosphere a total of 300 mL (0.30 mol) of 1 M borane in tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over a 1-hr period. The solution is stirred for 18 hr at 0°C, during which time a white precipitate of ( + )-di-3-pinanylborane forms. This solution is then cooled to −78°C. The ca. 0.30 mol solution of methyl 2,4-cyclo-pentadiene-1-acetate (Section B) is transferred at −78°C to a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel through a U-tube in an inert atmosphere and is added rapidly, in one portion, to the stirring solution of di-3-pinanylborane at −78°C. After this mixture is stirred for 6 hr at −78°C, the bath temperature is allowed to rise to 0°C and the mixture is stirred for 16 hr at 0°C to complete the hydroboration reaction.
About 8 l. of water is added to precipitate the p-dimethylaminobenzophenone. The solution, milky at first, soon deposits sandy crystals of light green color, which are collected on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel. They are transferred to a beaker and washed with 1.5 l. of water, after which they are again collected on the filter, washed, pressed as dry as possible, and air dried. With no further purification the melting point is 88–90°. The yield is 350–390 g. An additional 85–100 g. of inferior product, m.p. 70–80°, is obtained by treating the combined filtrates with a solution of 250 g. (6.2 moles) of sodium hydroxide. This product, air-dried as before, is dissolved in 300–400 cc. of hot alcohol from which, by partial evaporation and cooling, more than half separates in good crystalline form, m.p. 88–90.5°. This material may be combined with the first product of similar melting point. The total yield is 410–440 g. (72–77 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 64 g. (10 oxygen equivalents) of sodium dichromate dihydrate and 225 ml. of acetic acid is heated and swirled until all the solid has dissolved, and then is cooled in an ice bath to bring the temperature of the solution to 15°. In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask 25 g. (0.065 mole) of commercial cholesterol is dissolved in 225 ml. of benzene by brief warming, and the solution is cooled to 20°; 225 ml. of acetic acid is added, the solution is cooled to 15°, and the dichromate solution (at 15°) is poured in, whereupon a thick orange paste of cholesteryl chromate, (C27H45O)2CrO2, separates. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath that is allowed to stand in a refrigerator for 40–48 hours. No stirring or other attention is required in this period; the temperature soon drops to 0°, and the chromate dissolves in a few hours.
The flask is stoppered and cooled in a bath of ice and water for three hours; the reaction product should then separate in the form of a yellow, crystalline paste and. The crystals are collected on a 19-cm. Büchner funnel and washed, first with 200 cc. of 50 per cent acetic acid, and next with 400 cc. of ordinary ether. This crude, dry product, weighing 270–290 g., is placed in a 3-l. flask and heated under a reflux condenser with 1.7 l. of benzene for twenty minutes. The mixture is then allowed to cool to 40–45° and filtered through a 19-cm. Büchner funnel. The residue is a mixture of sparingly soluble isomers, chiefly 5- and 8-nitro-2-acetylaminonaphthalene. On further cooling of the filtered solution, there is obtained 190–200 g. of 1-nitro-2-acetylaminonaphthalene melting at 117–119°. This material is recrystallized from about 500 cc. of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. Fine yellow crystals melting at 123–124° are obtained. The yield is 175–182 g. (47–49 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask are placed 60 cc. of 50 per cent aqueous potassium hydroxide solution and 200 cc. of ether. The mixture is cooled to 5°, and 20.6 g. (0.2 mole) of nitrosomethylurea (p. 461) is added with shaking. The flask is fitted with a condenser set for distillation. The lower end of the condenser carries an adapter passing through a two-holed rubber stopper and dipping below the surface of 40 cc. of ether contained in a 300-cc. Erlenmeyer flask and cooled in an ice-salt mixture. The exit gases are passed through a second 40-cc. portion of ether likewise cooled below 0°. The reaction flask is placed in a water bath at 50° and brought to the boiling point of the ether with occasional shaking. The ether is distilled until it comes over colorless, which is usually the case after two-thirds of the ether has been distilled. Under no circumstances should all the ether be distilled. The combined ether solutions in the receiving flasks contain from 5.3 to 5.9 g. of diazomethane (63–70 per cent of the theoretical amount) and, which is sufficiently dry for most purposes.
The mixture is cooled to room temperature, the flask is filled two-thirds full with water, and stirring is continued for five minutes. The xylene solution is separated, washed with water, dried over calcium chloride, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure. After removal of the solvent, the tricarbomethoxymethane distils at 128–142°/18 mm. The yield of crude product is 50–51 g. (50–51 per cent of the theoretical amount). This material becomes semi-solid on cooling.
A. Bis (2,2,2-trichloroethyl)hydrazodicarboxylate. In a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and 250-mL and 125-mL dropping funnels is placed a solution of 13.34 g (0.23 mol) of 64% hydrazine hydrate in 60 mL of 95% ethanol. The reaction flask is cooled in an ice bath and 96 g (0.46 mol) of 2,2,2-trichloroethyl chloroformate is added dropwise so that the temperature is kept below 20°C. During the addition of 1 equiv of the chloroformate, a white precipitate is formed. After exactly one-half of the chloroformate has been added, a solution of 25 g (0.24 mol) of sodium carbonate in 100 mL of water is added dropwise along with the remaining chloroformate. The rate of addition of these two reagents is such that the flow of the chloroformate is faster than that of the sodium carbonate so that there is always an excess of chloroformate present; the temperature is kept below 20°C during the addition. As the second equivalent of chloroformate is added the white precipitate dissolves.
The resulting triethylamine hydrochloride precipitate (41.4 g., 81%) is filtered and washed with 100 ml. of dry ether. The solvent is removed from the combined filtrate by rotary evaporation, and the semi-solid residue crystallizes to an orange-red solid after refrigeration for several hours at ca. 5°. Crystallization from a mixture of 150 ml. of pentane and 120 ml. of dry ether affords 38.8 g. of diazoacetophenone as yellow square plates, m.p. 44–48°. Concentration of the mother liquor and extraction of the residue with boiling pentane yields an additional 7.8 g. of pale yellow rods, m.p. 47.5–48.5°, bringing the total yield to 46.6 g. (85%) and.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and Friedrichs condenser1, are placed 200 g. (1.7 moles) of fumaric acid and 400 g. of water. The materials are thoroughly mixed until the fumaric acid has been completely wet by the water. The resulting thick, viscous mass is then stirred vigorously and brought to boiling by heating on a wire gauze with a Bunsen flame.
D. Tris[(2-perfluorohexyl)ethyl]tin hydride. A 1-L, three-necked flask and a stirring bar are dried in an oven. The fluorous tin bromide (13.8 g, 11.1 mmol) is dissolved in dry ether (275 mL) and transferred to the dried three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, stirring bar, and an outlet to argon. The solution is cooled to 0°C. A 1 M solution of lithium aluminum hydride (LAH) in ether (11.1 mL, 11.1 mmol) is added dropwise over 45 min to the solution. The addition rate is adjusted to maintain a temperature between 0° and 1°C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hr at 0°C. Water (75 mL) is slowly added (initially dropwise) with stirring to the ice-cold mixture. Sodium potassium tartrate (20%) (250 mL) is added and the mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The ethereal layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted three times with ether (3 × 100 mL). The combined extracts are dried with magnesium sulfate and vacuum filtered into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude product is distilled under a reduced pressure of 0.02 mm at 133-140°C to provide 11.3 g (9.69 mmol, 87%) of the pure product as an oil.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask are placed 40 g. (0.32 mole) of 1-ethynylcyclohexanol (p. 416), 250 ml. of dry benzene, 10 g. of phosphorus pentoxide, and a boiling chip. A reflux condenser is attached to the flask, and the benzene solution is refluxed gently on a steam cone for 2.5 hours. At the end of that time the contents of the flask are cooled and the benzene is decanted from the phosphorus pentoxide, washed once with 100 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and dried over 15 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the acetylcyclohexene is carefully fractionated at reduced pressure, through a 15-cm. helix-packed column. The yield of material boiling at 85–88°/22 mm., nD20 1.4892, is 22.5–28 g. (56–70%).
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer is placed 120 g. (0.4 mole) of crystallized sodium dichromate (or an equivalent amount of potassium dichromate), and to this is added a solution of 100 g. (54.3 cc., 0.97 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 600 cc. of water. To this mixture 90 g. (0.58 mole) of menthol (crystals, m.p. 41–42°) is added in three or four portions and the mixture stirred. Heat is evolved, and the temperature of the mixture rises to about 55°. As soon as the reaction is complete the temperature falls. The oil is mixed with an equal volume of ether, separated in a separatory funnel, and washed with three 200-cc. portions of 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The ether is then removed by distillation and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, the menthone being collected at 98–100°/18 mm. If distilled under atmospheric pressure it boils at 204–207°. The yield is 74–76 g. (83–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The acid chloride, 12.7 g, is dissolved in 60 mL of dichloromethane and transferred to a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (12.5 g, 0.140 mol) dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise to the cold solution over 15 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for 2 hr. The white precipitate is removed by filtration and the mother liquor is removed by rotary evaporation to afford 15.7 g of the amido alcohol. The amido alcohol is redissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane and added to a 300-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar. Thionyl chloride (24.5 g, 0.206 mol) is added dropwise and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C (ice-water bath) and to it is added slowly 50 mL of cold water followed by approximately 50 mL of aqueous 40% sodium hydroxide solution, which basifies the reaction mixture to approximately pH 11. Saturated sodium chloride solution (approximately 50 mL) is added and the contents of the flask are transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The lower phase (CH2Cl2 solution) is removed and set aside while the upper, aqueous phase is extracted once with 50 mL of dichloromethane. The dichloromethane extracts are combined and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solution is then filtered through Celite and concentrated under reduced pressure to leave crude 2-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline (1). The latter is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 110°C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7–13.3 g (81–85%).
After cooling to room temperature, the product is broken up with the addition of 1–1.5 l. of water, filtered with suction, washed with cold water, drained, and dried. The crude p-ethoxyphenylurea is obtained in a yield of 740–810 g. (82–90%) as a nearly white to pale yellow solid. This material may be purified by recrystallization from boiling water, when minute white plates, m.p. 173–174°, are obtained. The method is applicable to the preparation of other substituted arylureas.
B. 3-Methylheptanoic acid. In a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride tube, and a dropping funnel are placed 25.0 g. (1.04 g. atoms) of magnesium turnings. The flask is heated to about 100° for a few minutes and then cooled to room temperature. A solution of 178 g. (1.30 moles) of n-butyl bromide in 300 ml. of dry ether is prepared; and of this solution about 10 ml., together with 30 ml. of dry ether, is run into the flask. The reaction is started by heating to reflux for a few seconds, the stirrer is started, and the remainder of the bromide solution is added at such a rate as to maintain constant reflux (about 1 hour).
In a 500-cc. Erlenmeyer flask, fitted with an air-cooled reflux condenser of large bore, are placed 100 g. (0.88 mole) of acetonylacetone and 200 g. (1.75 moles) of ammonium carbonate, in lumps. The mixture is heated in an oil bath at 100° until effervescence stops; this requires sixty to ninety minutes. The air-cooled condenser is replaced by a water-cooled condenser of large bore, and the mixture is refluxed gently at 115° (bath temperature) for thirty minutes longer and. The mixture is cooled, and the upper, yellow layer of the pyrrole is separated. The lower layer is extracted with 15 cc. of chloroform, which is added to the crude pyrrole. The whole is dried over anhydrous calcium chloride, in a tightly stoppered container which has been swept out with nitrogen beforehand.
In a 12-l. flask fitted with stirrer and reflux condenser are placed 600 g. (3.8 moles) of potassium permanganate, 7 l. of water, and 200 g. (1.6 moles) of o-chlorotoluene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 170). The mixture is slowly heated to boiling with continual stirring until the permanganate color has disappeared. This requires three to four hours. The condenser is now set downward for distillation, and the mixture is distilled, with constant stirring, until no more oil passes over with the water. The unattacked o-chlorotoluene thus obtained amounts to 25–30 g. The hot mixture is filtered with suction and the cake of hydrated manganese dioxide washed with two 500-cc. portions of hot water. The combined filtrate is concentrated to about 3.5 l.; if it is not entirely clear it may be clarified by the use of 1–2 g. of decolorizing carbon. It is now, while still hot, acidified by cautiously adding 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with continual agitation. When the mixture is cool the white precipitate of o-chlorobenzoic acid is filtered and washed with cold water. The dry weight is 163–167 g. (76–78 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the amount of o-chlorotoluene actually oxidized) of a very nearly pure product melting at 137–138°. For purification this may be recrystallized from 600 cc. of toluene, when 135–140 g. of a product melting at 139–140° is obtained. Further crops can be obtained by concentrating the mother liquor.
A. Methyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a nitrogen inlet. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 18.02 g (0.20 mol) of dimethyl carbonate, 50 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and 6.12 g (0.25 mol) of sodium hydride. The suspension is stirred and heated to reflux temperature, at which time the slow, dropwise addition of 7.80 g (0.080 mol) of cyclohexanone in 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is begun. After 2 min, 0.306 g (0.0076 mol) of powdered potassium hydride (Caution! Dry potassium hydride is pyrophoric.) is added to initiate the reaction. The addition of cyclohexanone is continued over a 1-hr period. The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for another 30 min, cooled in an ice bath for 15–20 min, and hydrolyzed by slowly adding 75 mL of 3 M aqueous acetic acid. The contents of the flask are poured into 100 mL of aqueous sodium chloride, and the aqueous mixture is extracted with four 150-mL portions of chloroform. The organic layers are combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated at room temperature with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residual liquid under reduced pressure gives 9.8–10.8 g (79–87%) of methyl 2-oxocyclohexanecarboxylate as a colorless liquid, bp 53–55°C (0.35 mm).
C. Aminoacetone semicarbazone hydrochloride. The product from step B is dissolved in 250 ml. of absolute alcohol in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask, and to this solution is added a solution of 48 g. of semicarbazide hydrochloride in 100 ml. of water. The mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours, the crystalline precipitate is collected by suction filtration, and the off-white product is washed on the filter with absolute alcohol. The crystals, after air-drying, amount to 54–58 g. (72–78%) and melt at 208–210°. The product is essentially pure and can be used for most purposes without further purification.
While the hydrolysis of the dihydropyran is taking place, 800 g. (575 ml., 9.25 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask and cooled in an ice-salt bath in a well-ventilated hood. The flask should be equipped with an efficient stirrer, separatory funnel, reflux condenser, and a thermometer. When the temperature of the solution reaches 0°, 5.75 g. of sodium nitrite is added and stirring is continued until most of it has dissolved; the solution becomes yellow.
B. (1S,2S)-2-Amino-1-[((2S)-2-carbomethoxypyrrolidinyl)carbonyl]cyclohexane (2). A 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser bearing a nitrogen inlet/outlet valve as above (Part A) and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with a solution of 20.0 g (90.0 mmol) of 1, 100 mL of anhydrous methanol, and 18.4 g (180 mmol) of concentrated sulfuric acid, placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and heated at reflux (oil bath temperature at 80–85°C) for 48 hr or until TLC analysis indicates the disappearance of 1. The solution is concd under reduced pressure, 100 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) is added, and the mixture is cooled to 0°C. A total of 150 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution is added in small portions with good stirring, followed by 10–12 mL of concd ammonium hydroxide until a pH of 10 is reached. After thorough mixing, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 50 mL of CH2Cl2. The combined organic phases are dried over Na2SO4, concentrated, and the resulting crude amine 2 used immediately in the next step.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 8 l. (120 moles) of aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.90) and to it is gradually added, with stirring, 189 g. (2 moles) of monochloroacetic acid. The solution is stirred until the chloroacetic acid is dissolved and is then set aside for about forty-eight hours at room temperature. The solution, which is colorless or faintly yellow, is concentrated on a water bath under reduced pressure to a volume of about 200 cc.
D. (2S)-(−)-3-(−)-exo-(Dimethylamino)isoborneol, [(−)-DAIB] , 5. Caution! Since DAIB slowly decomposes in air , samples of DAIB should be stored under nitrogen or argon . All glassware for this step must be oven-dried. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser connected to an argon inlet, a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, and a Teflon stopper, is flushed with argon and charged with 55 mL of dry THF and 5.20 g (0.075 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride. The solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, and a solution of 2.77 g (0.013 mol) of N-methyl-(1R,2S,6R,7S)-1,10,10-trimethyl-4-oxo-5-aza-3-oxatricyclo[5.2.1.0]decane (4) in 35 mL of dry THF is introduced slowly with a cannula. After addition is complete, the flask is removed from the cooling bath, and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 18 hr. The reaction flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, and the mixture is quenched by successive addition of 20 mL of ethyl acetate and 17 mL of saturated aqueous sodium sulfate solution. The white mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr, and the resulting white granular precipitate or slurry is removed by vacuum filtration through Celite. The filter cake is washed with three 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate , and the combined filtrates are thoroughly dried over sodium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to furnish crude 5 as an oil. Crude 5 is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation to give 2.19 g (84%) of (2S)-(−)-3-exo-(dimethylamino)isoborneol, [(2S)-(−)-DAIB] (5) as a nearly colorless oil, bp 150°C (25 mm), [α]D 22 36° (ethanol, c 4.65).
A dry 1-l. round-bottomed flask with five outlets is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a reflux condenser attached to a calcium chloride tube, an inlet for dry nitrogen (a weak stream of which is maintained through all the reaction until the hydrolysis step), and a thermometer reaching close to the bottom. In the flask are placed 9.0 g. (0.38 g. atom) of magnesium turnings, a crystal of iodine, and about 25 ml. of dry ether. With stirring, about 15 ml. of a solution of 88.5 g. (0.38 mole) of p-dibromobenzene in 500 ml. of dry ether is added at once. When the reaction has started, the remaining ether solution is added at a rate which maintains rapid refluxing. After the p-dibromobenzene has been added, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours.
This crude amine is added, with cooling, to a solution of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) in 350 cc. of water. The solution of the hydrochloride is cooled in an ice bath, and stirred rapidly, while a solution of 41.5 g. (0.6 mole) of sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is added slowly. During this addition the temperature should not be allowed to rise above 12°. After all the nitrite has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand for ten minutes and is then extracted with three 100-cc. portions of ether. The ether is evaporated from the extract by warming gently on a steam bath and blowing a stream of air over the surface. Care must be taken to keep the temperature as low as possible during the evaporation.
B. Dimethylphenysilyllithium. This reagent is prepared according to the procedure of Fleming and coworkers.2 A flame-dried, 300-mL, two-necked, Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet and a rubber septum is charged with 33 cm (45 mg/cm, 1.49 g, 214 mmol, 1.5 equiv) of lithium wire and is filled with nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran (60 mL, Note 10) is added by syringe through the septum. To the suspension of lithium wire is added chlorodimethylphenylsilane (12.0 mL, 71.5 mmol) by syringe at ambient temperature with stirring. Following the addition of chlorodimethylphenylsilane, the reaction flask is tightly sealed and then transferred to a −15 to −20 °C freezer and is allowed to stand for 59 h. The resulting, purple solution of dimethylphenylsilyllithium in THF is titrated to 0.97 M against phenolphthalein with 0.1 N HCl.
A. 3,3'-Di-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-aminodipropylamine. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a 500-mL addition funnel, a temperature probe and a static nitrogen inlet is charged with 3,3'-diaminodipropylamine (28.2 mL, 0.20 mol, 1.0 equiv), 300 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (100 mL, 0.57 mol, 2.8 equiv). A 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxyimino)-2-phenylacetonitrile (BOC-ON) (100 g, 0.41 mol, 2.0 equiv) and 300 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The resulting solutions are separately stirred at 0 °C for 30 min. The BOC-ON solution is then transferred to the addition funnel and added dropwise to the solution of 3,3'-diaminodipropylamine over a 90-100 min period. After addition is complete, the solution is left to stir at 0 °C for 3 h, warmed to ambient temperature, and left to stir for an additional 20 h. The solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator at 39 °C and the residue is dissolved in 400 mL of dichloromethane. The organic solution is washed with 10% NaOH (3 × 200 mL), a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium chloride (1 × 300 mL), and dried over sodium sulfate. Following filtration, the solvent is removed using a rotary evaporator at 32-39°C to afford the product as an oily material which is precipitated as an off-white solid by addition of hexane (500 mL) and traces of MeOH (3 mL). After standing in the freezer for 24 h, the solids are filtered, washed with hexane, and dried under vacuum overnight to provide the product as an off-white solid (54.2-55.9 g, 82-84 %), mp 68.1-70.0 °C.
A. o-Bromobenzenediazonium hexafluorophosphate. A solution of 95 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid in 650 ml. of water is added with stirring to 60 g. of o-bromoaniline (0.35 mole;) in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with stirrer and thermometer. Solution is effected by heating the mixture on a steam bath. A solution of 29 g. (0.42 mole) of sodium nitrite in 75 ml. of water is added with stirring while the mixture is maintained at −5° to −10° by means of a bath of ice and salt or of dry ice and acetone. At the end of the addition there is an excess of nitrous acid, which can be detected with starch iodide paper. Seventy-four milliliters (134 g., 0.60 mole) of 65% hexafluorophosphoric acid is added in one portion, with vigorous stirring, to the cold solution of the diazonium salt. Cooling and slow stirring are continued for an additional 30 minutes, and the precipitated diazonium hexafluorophosphate is then collected on a Büchner funnel. The diazonium salt is washed on the funnel with 300 ml. of cold water and with a solution of 80 ml. of methanol in 320 ml. of ether. The salt is partly dried by drawing air through the funnel for 2 hours. It is then transferred to a pile of several filter papers, powdered with a spatula, and dried at about 25°/1 mm. for at least 12 hours. The dried o-bromobenzenediazonium hexafluorophosphate is cream-colored; weight 108–111 g. (94–97%); m.p. 151–156° (dec.).
The combined ligroin filtrates and washings are distilled under atmospheric pressure, using a column, until the temperature of the liquid reaches 150°. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure and the fraction boiling at 108–109°/14 mm. is collected. The product is pure and melts at 53–54°. The yield is 263–266 g. (75–76 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To this vigorously stirred solution is added slowly a solution of 44.5 g. (0.20 mole) of benzalphthalide2 in 400 ml. of dry benzene. After about half of this solution has been added, the magnesium complex begins to separate; it hinders the stirring somewhat. When all the phthalide solution has been admitted (about 1 hour), the reflux condenser is replaced by a still head carrying a thermometer and attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. The bulk of the solvent is then removed; this requires about 30 minutes, the temperature of the vapor remaining at 50° for about half this time and rising to about 65° toward the end. About 220–230 ml. of distillate is obtained. The flask and contents are then immersed in an ice bath, and the magnesium complex is decomposed by the slow addition of a cold solution of 15 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 ml. of water with rapid stirring. The upper benzene layer is separated and transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the solvent is removed by distillation from a steam bath; this requires about 4 hours. The residual thick red syrup is transferred to a 125-ml. Claisen flask with a wide side arm set up for vacuum distillation. The residue is heated under a pressure of about 10 mm. to remove all low-boiling material and then is distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 215–255°/6 mm. (195–220°/1 mm.) is collected, most of the distillate coming over at 235–240°/6 mm. The distillate is dissolved in 50 ml. of boiling benzene, 200 ml. of hot 95% ethanol is added, and the solution is chilled in an ice bath for 2 hours. The red, crystalline 2,3-diphenylindone is collected on a filter, washed with 50 ml. of cold 95% ethanol, and air-dried. The yield is 34–40 g. (60–71%) of red crystals melting at 149–151° and.
A 125-ml. modified Claisen flask is arranged for distillation, but with a dropping funnel fitted in the neck intended for the ebullator tube. Portions of the dried ether solution are introduced into the flask through the funnel while the flask is heated on the steam bath for continuous removal of the solvent. After all the ether solution and the ether washings from the last drying agent have been concentrated, the dropping funnel is replaced by an ebullator tube and distillation under diminished pressure is begun cautiously. Fractions are collected at 60–96°/20 mm. and at 96–98°/20 mm. The first fraction is redistilled to give an additional quantity of material boiling at 96–98°/20 mm.. The combined product weighs 52–58 g. (60–67%).
A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser is charged with a solution of 25 g. of potassium hydroxide in 250 ml. of 95% ethanol, to which is added 16.6 g. (0.0498 mole) of methyl (trans-2-iodo-1-tetralin)carbamate. The resulting mixture is heated under reflux on a stream bath for 2 hours, cooled, and added to 500 ml. of water. The clear, yellow solution is shaken three times with 100-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The ether layers are combined, washed three times with 125-ml. portions of water and once with 125 ml. of a saturated sodium chloride, dried over 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. The ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath, giving the crude imine as a yellow-brown oil. The oil is transferred to a small flask, the container is rinsed with ether, and the rinse is added to the distillation flask. The product is collected by distillation through a small Vigreux column with warm water circulating through the condenser to prevent crystallization of the product. The fraction boiling at 80–82° (0.15–0.25 mm.) is collected as a solid that forms in the receiver, yielding 4.9–5.1 g. (68–70%) of the imine, m.p. 54–56°; the IR spectrum has a band at 3205 cm.−1 (NH).
A. 3-Butyn-1-yl trifluoromethanesulfonate. A 500-ml., three-necked flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a stopper. The system is flushed with nitrogen through a gas-inlet tube attached to the top of the funnel. To 150 ml. of dry dichloromethane in the flask is added 75 g. (0.27 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride, and the solution is cooled to −40°. After addition of 14.5 g. (0.175 mole) of finely powdered anhydrous sodium carbonate, 15g. (0.21 mole) of 3-butyn-1-ol is added dropwise over a 20-minute period to the well-stirred reaction mixture maintained at −40° to −55°. Stirring is continued at −30° for 2 hours, at 0° for another hour, and finally the reaction is quenched by dropwise addition of 50 ml. of water. The organic layer is separated, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated with a rotary evaporator, the temperature of the water bath not exceeding 25° The resulting residue is placed in a flask directly connected with a liquid nitrogen trap and distilled at 1 mm. The fractions boiling in the range from 40° to 50° are sufficiently pure for use in the next step. The yield of the sulfonate is 38.94 g. (90%) and.
The reaction mixture is allowed to stand until the temperature drops to 50–55°, after which it is heated on a steam bath until a sample added to water is neutral to phenolphthalein (about 2 hours). Water is added to dissolve the precipitate of sodium bromide, and the ethanol is removed by distillation. The flask is now arranged for steam distillation, and the ethyl 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylate and unchanged malonic ester are removed by steam distillation; about 4 l. of distillate is collected. The ester layer in the distillate is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted once with 1 l. of ether. The extract and the ester layer are combined, and the ether is removed on the steam bath.
A 4-l. beaker containing a solution of 100 g. (0.95 mole) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 900 ml. of water is placed on a steam bath, provision being made for efficient mechanical stirring. The stirrer is started and, when the solution is hot, one-third of a solution of 100 g. (0.63 mole) of potassium permanganate in 600 ml. of hot water is added all at once, followed by a 34-g. portion of DL-10-camphorsulfonyl chloride. After an interval of 5–10 minutes, half the remaining permanganate is poured in, followed by 33 g. of the chloride. After a similar interval, the remaining permanganate solution and a final 33-g. portion of the chloride are added and heating is continued for an hour.
After cooling, the precipitated sodium chloride is removed by filtering with suction and is washed with two 50-cc. portions of absolute alcohol. The alcohol is removed by distilling through a short column from a steam bath. The residue is filtered and transferred to a round-bottomed flask and is fractionated under reduced pressure through a Widmer column containing an 8-cm. spiral. The fraction boiling at 121–124°/5 mm. is collected. The yield is 121–134 g. (56–62 per cent of the theoretical amount).
For purification the crude product is dissolved in 200 cc. of water (warming if necessary), 1 l. of methyl alcohol is added, and the mixture chilled overnight. After washing as before, the yield is about 38–42 g. (65–70 per cent of the theoretical amount) of purified dl-alanine, m. p. 295° (dec.) on the Maquenne block. This product is free of bromide and contains only traces of ammonia. If an especially pure product is desired the material may be reprecipitated from methyl alcohol once more in the same manner.
A. 1-Iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane. In a dry, 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a rubber septum is placed 15.0 g (0.10 mol) of sodium iodide. A nitrogen inlet tube is connected to the top of the reflux condenser and all the apparatus is kept under nitrogen. To this vessel are added 50 mL of acetone and 11.5 mL (10 g, 0.066 mol) of 1-chloro-3-trimethylsilylpropane with a hypodermic syringe through the septum; the resulting white suspension is stirred under reflux for 24 hr. The condenser is replaced with a Claisen head, and the bulk of the solvent is removed under ordinary pressure to give a white slurry. To this is added 60 mL of hexane and the inorganic salts are filtered off by suction. The filter cake is washed with five 10-mL portions of hexane. The hexane is distilled off from the combined organic portions at atmospheric pressure. The residual oil is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirring bar and a Claisen head, and is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 1-iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane 1 (11.5–13.1 g, 72–81%), bp 84–86°C (25 mm), as a clear liquid and.
(B) unsym.-Dimethylhydrazine Hydrochloride.—In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and thermometer, are put 200 g. (2.7 moles) of nitrosodimethylamine, 3 l. of water, and 650 g. (10 gram atoms) of 100 per cent zinc dust, or an equivalent amount of lower-quality material. While the mixture is stirred and maintained at 25–30° by immersion in a water bath, 1 l. (14 moles) of 85 per cent acetic acid is added from the dropping funnel over a period of two hours. Subsequently the reaction mixture is heated for one hour at 60°, allowed to cool, and the excess zinc dust filtered and washed with a little water. The aqueous liquors are combined and transferred to a 12-l. flask arranged for steam distillation. The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, and the steam inlet is provided with a trap. A large filtering or distilling flask serves as the receiver, and the side tube is connected with two absorption flasks, each containing 1 : 1 hydrochloric acid. The aqueous liquors are made distinctly alkaline by adding a concentrated solution of 1 kg. of sodium hydroxide through the dropping funnel, and the mixture is then steam-distilled until a test portion of the distillate shows only a faint reduction with Fehling's solution. Usually about 5–6 l. of distillate suffices to remove the dimethylhydrazine. The distillation is more rapid if a free flame is placed under the distillation flask.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser attached to a Dean-Stark water separator, and a 250-ml. dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 25.0 g. (0.16 mole) of 3,7-dimethyl-6-octenal and 500 ml. of toluene. The solution is heated to reflux with stirring, and a solution of N-methylhydroxylamine, methanol, and toluene is added (see below).
B. Diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3). An oven-dried, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated stirring bar and a rubber septum through which is inserted a large bore, needle-tipped nitrogen line vented through an oil bubbler, is charged with 29.7 g (0.110 mol) of diethyl (2S,3S)-2-bromo-3-hydroxy succinate and 80 mL of dry ethanol. In a separate, oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, capped with a rubber septum and vented though a bubbler as described above, a solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol is prepared from 3.05 g of sodium (0.132 mol) and 120 mL of dry ethanol. (Caution: This operation should be conducted in a well-ventilated hood. Sodium is a highly reactive metal, avoid exposure to moisture. Hydrogen gas, which is highly flammable and forms explosive mixtures with air, is rapidly evolved. External cooling may be necessary.) The two flasks are placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, and connected by means of a long double needle-tipped cannula. Magnetic stirring is initiated, and the ethanolic solution of the succinate 2 is cooled in an ice-water bath for 15 min followed by dropwise addition of the solution of sodium ethoxide in ethanol which is transferred via the cannula under a very slight positive pressure of nitrogen. Complete transfer of the base should require 2 hr. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0–10°C (bath temperature) and then quenched by the addition of 1.43 mL (0.025 mol) of acetic acid. The reaction mixture is diluted with 900 mL of water, transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel, and extracted four times with 100 mL of dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are washed with 100 mL of brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give a colorless oil. Vacuum distillation of this crude product affords 17.7–18.7 g (85–90%) of diethyl (2R,3R)-2,3-epoxysuccinate (3), bp 97–98°C (0.9 mm) [lit.2bp 100–104°C (4 mm)], [α]25D −110° (EtOH, c 5.09), [α]28D −115° (neat) [lit.2 [α]21.5D −88.47° (ether, c 1.030)] which is homogeneous by GLC analysis, and,(Note 14),(Note 15).
After the bromine has been added the ether and dissolved hydrogen bromide are removed at once under reduced pressure with a slight current of air. The phenacyl bromide remains as a solid mass of brownish yellow crystals; the color is removed by shaking with a mixture of 10 cc. of water and 10 cc. of petroleum ether. The crystals are filtered with suction and washed several times with fresh portions of the solvent mixture, if necessary, until a white product is obtained. The crude phenacyl bromide weighs 74–80 g. (88–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 45–48°. This material is sufficiently pure for many purposes. If higher purity is desired the crude product may be recrystallized from 25–30 cc. of methanol, yielding 54–55 g. (64–66 per cent of the theoretical amount) of white crystals melting at 49–51°.
B. 1-Benzyl-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-p-tolyl-1H-pyrazole (4). In a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3.8-cm, egg-shaped Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a condenser, 4-chlorobenzaldehyde (4.86 g, 34.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is dissolved in MeOH (150 mL) and then water (10 mL) is added. Benzylhydrazine dihydrochloride (6.75 g, 34.5 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is added in one portion. After stirring the mixture at room temperature for 3 h, hydrazone 3 is formed. 4-Methyl-β-nitrostyrene (4.51 g, 27.7 mmol) is added in one portion and the reaction solution is stirred at room temperature open to air until complete. The condenser is replaced with a 125-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel and water (50 mL) is slowly added into the mixture over 20 min and the resulting white suspension is stirred at room temperature for an additional 1 h. The resulting white solid is collected on a 250-mL fritted glass Büchner funnel by vacuum filtration (washing with ca. 30 mL of 1:1 MeOH/H2O) and is suction-dried (ca. 10 min). The solid is transferred into a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask and further dried under vacuum at room temperature for 8 h. The title compound is obtained as a white solid (9.12 g, 25.3 mmol, 92%).
A. (2S)-(−)-3-exo-Aminoisoborneol , 2. All glassware for this step must be oven-dried prior to use. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flaskequipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer attached to a Teflon stirring blade, a thermometer, and a 1-L pressure-equalizing addition funnel connected to an argon inlet is flushed with argon and charged with 475 mL of dry diethyl ether and 5.12 g (0.14 mol) of lithium aluminum hydride Note 2. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of 8.46 g (0.047 mol) of (1R,4S)-(−)-camphorquinone monoxime (1) in 350 mL of dry ether. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath with stirring, and the solution of 1 is added slowly to the reaction mixture over 30 min. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is replaced with a reflux condenser connected to the argon inlet, and the reaction flask is removed from the cooling bath. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for 1.5 hr and then cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath. The reaction is quenched very carefully by dropwise addition of 75 mL of saturated aqueous sodium sulfate solution. The resulting white granular precipitate or slurry is removed by vacuum filtration through Celite, and the filter cake is washed with three portions of 75 mL of chloroform . The combined filtrate and washings are dried over sodium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 40°C to give 8.07 g of crude (2S)-(−)-3-exo-aminoisoborneol (2) as an off-white solid. This material is suitable for the next reaction without purification.
A dry, 50-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas-inlet tube for nitrogen, a magnetic stirring bar, and a serum stopper for the introduction of reagents is flushed with nitrogen, stoppered with a glass stopper, charged with 17 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, then immersed in an ice bath. Stirring is begun and 3.3 g. (3.9 ml., 0.028 mole) of triethylaluminum is introduced into the flask with a dry hypodermic syringe,. After 5–10 minutes, 4.8 ml. of a 3.57 M solution of hydrogen cyanide (0.017 mole) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added with a dry hypodermic syringe. The stirring is continued for about 5–10 minutes.
Three hundred fifty cubic centimeters of concentrated sulfuric acid is placed in a 3-l. flask and cooled to −10°. The total first crop of moist α-phenylacetoacetonitrile obtained according to the procedure on p. 487 (corresponding to 188–206 g., or 1.2–1.3 moles of dry product) is added slowly, with shaking, the temperature being kept below 20°. After all is added the flask is warmed on the steam bath until solution is complete and then for five minutes longer. The solution is cooled to 0°, 1750 cc. of water added rapidly, and the flask placed on a vigorously boiling water bath and heated for two hours, with occasional shaking. The ketone forms a layer and, after cooling, is separated and the acid layer extracted with 600 cc. of ether. The oil and ether layers are washed successively with 100 cc. of water, the ether combined with the oil and dried over 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is collected on a filter, washed with ether, and discarded. The ether is removed from the filtrates, and the residue distilled from a modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm. The fraction boiling at 109–112°/24 mm. is collected; it weighs 125–150 g. (77–86 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After stirring for a total of two hours, the mixture is heated to 85°, 15 g. of decolorizing carbon is added, and the solution stirred for fifteen minutes and filtered. The filtrate is reheated to 85° with agitation and the volume estimated. For each 100 cc. of the solution 27 g. of hydrated sodium acetate (usually 450–500 g. in all) is added slowly, with vigorous stirring, in four or five portions. The dye is thus caused to separate in an easily filterable form. On "spotting" a drop of the mixture on filter paper by means of a stirring rod, the dye should form a dark blue mass in the center of a red or violet rim. The mixture, while still warm, is filtered with suction on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel, and as much as possible of the mother liquor is removed. The filter cake is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water at 85° and resalted as above with about 300 g. of sodium acetate, in several portions, or until most of the dye is salted out. In a "spot" test on filter paper, little red should be left in the rim. The product is collected, redissolved in 1.2 l. of water at 85°, and salted again. This time enough sodium acetate should be added to give a small rim which shows no red impurity. The product is collected, dried in an oven at 110° for at least twenty-four hours, ground, and passed through a 40-mesh sieve.
C. Preparation of Z-iodohexene. A dry, 100-mL flask with a sidearm is charged with 26.7 g (0.105 mol) of iodine, equipped with a stirring bar, three-way stopcock, and rubber septum, and flushed with argon as described above (Section A). The iodine is dissolved by introducing, with stirring, 30 mL of tetrahydrofuran through the septum with a syringe. Flask A, which contains the iodine solution, is connected to flask B, which contains the vinyl cuprate solution as shown in Figure 1. The cuprate solution is kept between −60° and −50°C while the iodine solution is pushed through the Teflon tubing, C. Then the cooling bath is removed and the temperature is allowed to rise to −10°C, whereupon a precipitate of copper(I) iodide is formed and the mixture turns yellow. After 10 min at −10°C, a mixture of 100 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride and 10 mL of saturated sodium bisulfite is added with vigorous stirring. The mixture is filtered by suction through 10 g of Celite on a sintered-glass funnel (No. 3), the contents of the funnel are washed twice with 50 mL of ether, and the filtrate is separated into two layers. The inorganic layer is washed twice with 50 mL of pentane, and the combined organic layers are washed with aqueous sodium bisulfite and saturated ammonium chloride solution and dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The solvents are removed by distillation through a 20-cm Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure. A spatula of copper powder is added to the residue, and the stirred mixture is distilled under reduced pressure through a 10-cm Vigreux colum to give 13.5–15.5 g (65–75%) of Z-1-iodohexene, bp 47°C/(15 mm) and.
A solution of 0.375 mole of diazomethane in 1 l. of diethyl ether is placed in a 2-l. flask fitted with a large magnetic stirring bar, a two-necked adapter, equipped with a drying tube (containing potassium hydroxide pellets), and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. Triethylamine (37.9 g., 52.1 ml., 0.375 mole) is added, and the flask contents are cooled to ca. −10° to −5°. A solution of 52.75 g. (43.56 ml., 0.3754 mole) of benzoyl chloride in 300 ml. of dry ether is added to the stirred mixture over a period of 0.5 hour. An additional 50 ml. of ether is rinsed through the dropping funnel. Stirring is continued for one hour at approximately 0°, then overnight at room temperature.
A dry, 500-mL, two-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 8.4 mL (45.8 mmol) of dimethyl (2S,3S)-2,3-O-isopropylidenetartrate and 250 mL of absolute 2-propanol. To the resulting solution is added with a plastic syringe and hypodermic needle 1.35 mL (4.6 mmol) of tetraisopropyl titanate. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for 2 hr. To remove the methanol formed, the flask is transferred to a rotary evaporator, and the contents are concentrated to 10–12 mL. The oily residue is once more dissolved in 250 mL of absolute 2-propanol and refluxed for 2 hr. The solvent is removed again in a rotary evaporator, and the resulting yellow oil is dissolved in 100 mL of diethyl ether. After addition of 5 mL of water the pale mixture is vigorously stirred for 10 min and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The flaky suspension is filtered and the filter cake washed with three 25-mL portions of ether. The ether solution is concentrated in a rotary evaporator. The residue, 12.5–13.1 g of a slightly yellow oil, solidifies on standing. This solid is freed from small amounts of solvent by an oil-pump vacuum (ca. 0.01 mm) at room temperature for 2 hr. Further purification by short-path distillation at 91–93°C/0.05 mm furnishes 11.5–12.0 g (91–95%) of a slightly yellow solid, which turns colorless on crushing, mp 41.5–42.5°C, [α]DRT +42 ± 0.3° (CHCl3, c 4).
C. ( + )-(7aS)-7a-Methyl-2,3,7,7a-tetrahydro-1H-indene-1,5(6H)-dione. A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and nitrogen inlet is charged with 50 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide. The contents of the flask are cooled to −20°C with a dry ice–acetone bath and 2.70 mL (4.97 g, 48.6 mmol) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added over 5–10 min at a rate to maintain a temperature of −15 to −20°C.
After the reaction mixture has cooled to room temperature, it is filtered with suction and, and the residual salts are washed thoroughly with three 100-ml. portions of anhydrous ether. The combined ethereal filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure at room temperature, and the residual liquid is fractionally distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column. After a small forerun has been collected, the product is obtained as a clear, colorless liquid, b.p. 46–47° (10 mm.), n20D 1.4752. The yield is 21–23 g. (55–60%); practically no residue remains in the distillation pot.
C. (S)-2-[(4S)-N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-4-yl]-2-tert-butyldimethylsiloxyethanal (4) . A 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 2-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar, is charged with a mixture of the O-silyl ether 3 (2.0 g, 4.66 mmol), activated 4 Å powdered molecular sieves (9.33 g), and 47 mL of acetonitrile and. The suspension is stirred at room temperature for 10 min, then methyl triflate (0.63 mL, 5.6 mmol,) is added via syringe. Caution! Methyl triflate is toxic and a suspected carcinogen that should be handled in a well-ventilated fume hood. The mixture is vigorously stirred for 15 min and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. To the residue suspended in 47 mL of 1:1 methanol/diethyl ether and cooled with an ice-water bath is added under vigorous stirring sodium borohydride (0.39 g, 10.3 mmol,). Upon completion of the addition, the flask is removed from the ice bath and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 15 min, diluted with acetone (4 mL) and filtered through a Celite pad. The pad is rinsed with three 47-mL portions of acetone and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 47 mL of acetonitrile-water (10:1) and the flask is placed in an ultrasonic cleaning bath and treated with 98% copper(II) oxide (2.97 g, 37.3 mmol,) and then with 95% copper(II) chloride dihydrate (0.79 g, 4.63 mmol,). After 10 min, the mixture is filtered through a Celite pad that is rinsed with four 47-mL portions of acetonitrile . The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to give a brown syrup. The brown residue is sonicated for 5 min each with five 47-mL portions of diethyl ether , in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. The liquid layer is pipetted and filtered through a 1 × 6.5-cm (h × d) Florisil (100-200 mesh) pad. The filtrate appears almost colorless and is concentrated under reduced pressure, to give 1.4-1.52 g (80-87% crude yield) of crude aldehyde 4 as a clear yellow oil. Analysis of the crude product by 1H NMR indicates a chemical purity of 90-95%. Crude 4 can be purified by flash chromatography over a 4.5 × 15-cm column of Silica Gel 60 eluting with cyclohexane-ethyl acetate (9:1) to give 1.3-1.4 g (75-80% yield) of pure aldehyde.
A dry, 300-ml., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and reflux condenser (to which is attached a Drierite-filled drying tube) and charged with 90 ml. of carbon tetrachloride and 15.42 g. of geraniol (0.1001 mole). To this solution is added 34.09 g. (0.1301 mole) of triphenylphosphine, and the stirred reaction mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. This mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature; dry pentane is added (100 ml.), and stirring is continued for an additional 5 minutes.
The product is added to 75 ml. of benzene, and the suspension is boiled until the frothing has ceased, the benzene lost being replaced; the resulting suspension is filtered to remove the insoluble material. The clear filtrate is heated to boiling, diluted with 25 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 70–90°), and allowed to cool slowly. The yield of white product, m.p. 145–146.5°, is 9.7–10.2 g. (82–86%). The over-all yield from anthranilic acid is 43–55%.
A solution of 200 g. (2.33 moles) of γ-butyrolactone in 375 ml. of absolute ethanol is cooled to 0° in an ice bath while a stream of dry hydrogen bromide is introduced. The passage of gas is discontinued 1 hour after hydrogen bromide is seen to pass through the reaction mixture unchanged.
C. 2-Phenylethyl benzoate. The carbon tetrachloride solution of N-nitroso-N-(2-phenylethyl)benzamide and 0.1 g. of sodium carbonate are placed in a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hours. The evolution of nitrogen ceases, and the yellow color of the nitrosoamide weakens or disappears near the end of this period. The solution is washed with 5% sodium hydroxide solution, water, and dried. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the 2-phenylethyl benzoate distilled; b.p. 139–142° (1 mm.), yield 5.8–6.1 g. [56–59% based on N-(2-phenylethyl)benzamide].
The total yield is 255–261 g. (86–88 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product melts at 119–120°.
A solution of 200 g. (3.6 moles) of potassium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water is placed in a 2-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated to about 80°, and 202 g. (1 mole) of isopropylmalonic ester is added through the condenser over a period of about one hour. The mixture should be shaken well to prevent the formation of two layers. The saponification proceeds rapidly, forming a clear solution. The solution is transferred to a 20-cm. evaporating dish, the flask is rinsed with 50 cc. of water, and the solution and washings are evaporated practically to dryness on a steam bath.
B. Ethyl 4-cyclohexyl-4-oxobutanoate (4). In a dry, 100-mL, two-necked flask with one neck connected to a nitrogen source to maintain a positive pressure and with the other covered with a rubber septum is placed a magnetic stirring bar. Tin tetrachloride (7.50 g, 28.8 mmol) and 15 mL of dry methylene chloride are introduced with a hypodermic syringe and the solution is cooled to ca. −75°C with a dry ice/hexane bath. A mixture of cyclohexanone diethyl ketal (4.82 g, 28.0 mmol) and 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclobut-1-ene (6.44 g, 28.0 mmol) in 10 mL of methylene chloride is added during 10 min. The yellow solution is stirred for 15 min at −75°C, and for 15 min at −30°C, during which period the solution turns heterogeneous. Water (20 mL) and ether (50 mL) are added and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted twice with ether (50 mL) and the combined organic layers are washed successively with 3 × 10-mL portions of 1 N hydrochloric acid, and 20-mL portions each of water, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and saturated sodium chloride. The oily product (6.30 g) obtained after drying (anhydrous magnesium sulfate) and concentration on a rotary evaporator is distilled to give an analytically pure keto ester (4) (5.27–5.44 g, 90–93%) as a fraction boiling at 110–112°C, 2.5 mm, or 84°C, 0.2 mm.
A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a glass stopper is charged with 110 ml. of trifluoroacetic acid and 54.34 g. (0.1008 mole) of solid thallium(III) trifluoroacetate. A clear solution is obtained after 30 minutes of vigorous stirring. Upon addition of 10.6 g. (0.100 mole) of p-xylene, the reaction mixture turns brown. After vigorous stirring for 20 minutes, the trifluoroacetic acid is removed on a rotary evaporator with a bath temperature of 35°, and the residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of diethyl ether. The solvent is again evaporated, and the solid residue is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether. With ice cooling, a solution of 33.2 g. (0.200 mole) of potassium iodide in 100 ml. of water is added in one portion. After the resulting dark suspension is stirred vigorously for 10 minutes, a solution of 3 g. of sodium bisulfite in 30 ml. of water is added. Yellow thallium(I) iodide is removed by filtration after another 10 minutes of vigorous stirring and washed thoroughly with 150 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 60-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide and twice with 20 ml. of water. After being dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 1 hour, the ether is removed on a rotary evaporator. Distillation under reduced pressure yields 18.5–19.6 g. (80–84%) of pure 2-iodo-p-xylene, b.p. 110–113° (19 mm.),(Note 9),(Note 10).
C. α,α'-Dibromodibenzyl sulfone. To a solution of 24.9 g. (0.0824 mole) of crude α,α'-diphenylthiodiglycolic acid in 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid contained in a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a bulb condenser is added 37.4 g. (0.33 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide over a 30-minute period, with ice bath cooling and magnetic stirring. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature, and after 3 days 30 g. (0.19 mole) of bromine is added in one portion, followed by 30 g. of potassium bromide in 150 ml. of water. A sunlamp, focused on the reaction mixture from a distance of 1 in., causes the solution to warm to 80°. After heating at 80° for 30 minutes the mixture is cooled, and the solid is filtered and washed with water and ethanol, yielding 9–10 g. (27–30%) of crude α,α'-dibromodibenzyl sulfone, m.p. 135–150°. The mixture of diastereomers is pure enough to be used directly in the synthesis of 2,3-diphenylvinylene sulfone.
The resulting product is purified by column chromatography on 90 g of silica gel eluting with a mixture of 30% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether. The chromatographed material is further purified by recrystallization from diethyl ether/pentane (2:1) to give 7.1 g (78%) of 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-one as a pale yellow solid, mp 58-59°C. An additional 1.6 g (18%; mp 58-59°C) can be isolated by concentration of the mother liquor and column chromatography of the residue on 30 g of silica gel eluting with a mixture of 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether .
The reaction mixture is concentrated by distillation under reduced pressure. At first the solvent may be distilled rapidly, but, after the mixture becomes syrupy, the distillation should be carried out below 30° until the residue is almost solid. At a pressure of 10 mm. the concentration requires about 2 hours. The residue is diluted with 500 ml. of cold water, which should be added in several portions with thorough shaking to break up all the lumps. The product is collected on a filter and washed with dilute hydrochloric acid until the filtrate comes through colorless.
B. 1-Iodo-1-octyne (4). A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen and equipped with a oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm), a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, a low temperature thermometer, and a rubber septum is charged via 20-mL plastic syringes with 1-octyne (3) (14.75 mL, 11.02 g, 100.0 mmol) and hexanes (125 mL) and). The resulting opaque solution is cooled with gentle stirring in an acetone/dry ice bath to an internal temperature of -52 &Degree;C. The stirring rate is increased, and a solution of 2.5 M n-butyllithium in hexanes (40.0 mL, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added dropwise over 20 min via a 20-mL plastic syringe. A white precipitate begins to form less than 1 min into the addition. Upon completion of the addition, the flask is fully submersed in the dry ice bath to bring the internal temperature to -70 &Degree;C. The viscous reaction mixture is stirred vigorously at this temperature for 1.5 h. On occasion, the stir bar stops stirring in the thick slurry and is dislodged using the thermometer. During this time, a flame-dried, 500-mL pear-shaped flask is charged with iodine (25.4 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and diethyl ether (100 mL) is added via a 20-mL plastic syringe. The resulting suspension is swirled vigorously by hand for approximately 5 min before the deep red supernatant is transferred to the pressure-equalizing addition funnel via cannula. The residual solid iodine is taken up with vigorous stirring in 30 mL of diethyl ether, which is again transferred to the addition funnel via cannula.
All fractions melting above 200° are combined and recrystallized from water by adding 700 ml. of water for each 30 g. of crystals, heating the mixture in a covered beaker until solution occurs, treating with charcoal, and filtering through a warm funnel. The crystals deposit upon the slightest cooling. After cooling, the yellow needles (occasionally plates) are filtered, washed, and air-dried; their melting point is 204° or higher, with decomposition. The fractions melting at 195–200° are recrystallized in like manner until the melting point is raised to 203°. The yield of crude picrate is 95–100 g. (61–64%); of recrystallized picrate, 84–94 g. (54–60%). The melting point varies slightly with the rate of heating between 203.5° and 206° with decomposition.
The benzene solution of the diazo compound is poured into a separatory funnel protected with a drying tube and connected to a 125-ml. Claisen distilling flask provided with a condenser set for downward distillation and arranged so that it can be heated in a bath of Wood's metal. The temperature of the metal bath being maintained at 100–110°, the benzene solution is dropped slowly into the hot flask. Under these conditions, the benzene is removed by distillation and the diazo compound is transformed into diphenylketene. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure in an atmosphere of nitrogen, and the fraction boiling at 115–125° at 3–4 mm. is collected. The yield is 31 g. (64%) of a product which, on redistillation, yields 28 g. of diphenylketene boiling at 119–121° at 3.5 mm. (58%).
The catalyst is separated by filtration, and the aqueous solution is extracted with three 30-ml. portions of ether, acidified with 30% sulfuric acid, boiled for 45 min. with 6–7 g. of carbon, then filtered hot. The filtrate is cooled to 0° and allowed to stand at this temperature for 1 hour or longer. The 2-furoic acid, which separates as pale pink needles, m.p. 130–132°, is collected by suction filtration and washed with small portions of ice water. The yield is 96–101 g. (86–90%).
The reaction mixture is cooled again in ice, 200 ml. of water is added cautiously, and the resulting two-phase mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 minutes. After transferring the mixture to a separatory funnel, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane solutions are washed once with 50 ml. of water, twice with 50-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness at reduced pressure, yielding 30.4–30.9 g. (94–96%) of (2-chlorobenzoyl)ferrocene as a viscous, red liquid, which gradually solidifies.
A. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-L-valine methyl ester(1). A 1-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a pressure-equalizing, 50-mL addition funnel, thermometer, and magnetic stirring bar is charged under an argon atmosphere with (S)-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)valine (65.2 g, 0.300 mol), dimethylformamide (DMF) (440 mL) and potassium hydrogen carbonate (60.1 g, 0.600 mol). Methyl iodide (29.9 mL, 0.480 mol) is added dropwise to this suspension over a period of 30 min. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 3 hr. The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel, diluted with water (1.2 L) and extracted with a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane (3 × 250 mL). The organic phases are combined and successively washed with water (2 × 250 mL), aqueous 5% sodium sulfite (2 × 250 mL), and brine (250 mL). After drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed and the oily residue is dried under vacuum (10 mbar) at room temperature. Crude 1 (69.4 g) is used in Step C without further purification.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, are placed 100 g. (0.435 mole) of 1-nitro-2-acetylaminonaphthalene (p. 438) and a solution of 112 g. (2.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 2.7 l. of water. The mixture is boiled until ammonia is no longer evolved (six to seven hours). The solution becomes deep red in color. It contains suspended crystals of sodium nitronaphthoxide; these are dissolved by the addition of 1 l. of hot water. The small amount of insoluble material is removed by filtration, washed with hot water until the washings are colorless, and then discarded although it contains a little nitronaphthylamine. The combined washings and filtrate are made acid by adding 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. The nitronaphthol precipitates as small, bright yellow crystals which are filtered on a 10-cm. Büchner funnel, washed with water, and dried. The yield of material melting at 101–103° is 76–81 g. (92–98 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 6-(Dimethylamino)fulvene. A 1-l. four-necked flask is equipped with mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel with calcium chloride drying tube, thermometer, and nitrogen delivery apparatus. The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen, and in it is placed 1.0 mole of cyclopentadienylsodium2 in 700 ml. of tetrahydrofuran. The dimethylformamide-dimethyl sulfate complex prepared above is transferred to the dropping funnel and added slowly with stirring under nitrogen to the cyclopentadienylsodium at −10° (ice-salt bath). During the addition the temperature is kept below −5°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at 20° for 2 hours. The solution is filtered (with suction) from the precipitated sodium methyl sulfate, which is washed with another 200 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, and the combined tetrahydrofuran solutions are concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is a dark brown oil which solidifies on cooling.
One hundred sixty grams (1.7 moles) of a good grade of phenol and 80 g. (1.43 moles) of potassium hydroxide are placed in a 2-l. flask, and the mixture is heated to 130–140° until all the alkali has dissolved. The potassium phenoxide is cooled to 100–110°, and 0.5 g. of copper catalyst and 78.8 g. (0.5 mole) of p-nitrochlorobenzene are added. The flask is then fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a reflux condenser. The stirrer is started, and the contents of the flask are warmed with a Bunsen burner to 150–160°, at which temperature a spontaneous reaction begins with ebullition and the separation of potassium chloride. The flame should be removed during this stage of the reaction. Boiling nearly ceases within five to seven minutes, and another 78.8 g. (0.5 mole) of p-nitrochlorobenzene is added. The mixture is again heated as before until a second spontaneous reaction begins. This also proceeds for about five minutes without the application of heat. When boiling due to the exothermic reaction has ceased, heat is applied and a temperature of 150–160° is maintained for an additional thirty minutes. The dark-colored melt is then poured into 1.5 l. of ice water containing 50 g. of sodium hydroxide and stirred well to remove excess phenol. The crude p-nitrodiphenyl ether separates as a dark brown crystalline mass which is allowed to settle. The product is filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed with 2 l. of water, and pressed as free from water as possible. After drying in the air it is distilled from a 500-cc. Claisen flask. The small fraction boiling up to 170°/8 mm., which contains p-nitrochlorobenzene, is discarded. A fraction boiling at 170–188°/8 mm. and weighing 14 g. is collected. The main fraction boiling at 188–193°/8 mm. boils at 188–190°/8 mm. on redistillation with no fore-run and practically no residue. p-Nitrodiphenyl ether solidifies on cooling to diamond-shaped crystals melting at 56–58°. The yield is 173–177 g. (80–82 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 1-l. three-necked flask having ground-glass joints is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a mercury-sealed stirrer, and all exits are protected by drying tubes. In the flask are placed 300 ml. of rigorously dried ether and 13.6 g. (0.36 mole) of pulverized lithium aluminum hydride. After the mixture has been stirred for 15 minutes, a milky suspension is produced. A solution of 88.6 g. (0.60 mole) of dichloroacetyl chloride in 75 ml. of dry ether is added from the dropping funnel at a rate such as to produce gentle reflux. The process is completed in about 2.5 hours.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, separatory funnel, and reflux condenser connected with a gas absorption trap (Fig. 7 on p. 97) for disposing of the evolved hydrogen chloride, is placed 392 g. (2.5 moles) of bromobenzene in 1-l. of dry carbon disulfide. To this is added 750 g. (5.6 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The mixture is heated on a steam bath until gentle refluxing starts, and then 204 g. (2 moles) of acetic anhydride is added slowly through the dropping funnel. The time of addition is about one hour. Gentle refluxing should be continued throughout the time of addition of the anhydride and for one hour afterward. The reaction is accompanied by a copious evolution of hydrogen chloride which does not entirely cease even after this subsequent heating.
A. 3-(Mesitylamino)butan-2-one. A 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 3-hydroxybutan-2-one (13.2 g, 150 mmol, 1.5 equiv), mesitylamine (13.52 g, 100 mmol, 1.0 equiv), toluene (150 mL) and a catalytic amount of concentrated HCl (approximately 0.05 mL). The flask is then fitted with a Dean-Stark trap topped with a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The solution is heated at reflux in a silicon oil bath for 3 h and the water generated is collected in the Dean-Stark trap (ca. 1.5 mL). The resulting yellow solution is allowed to cool to ambient temperature and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 8 mmHg). The oily residue is transferred to a 50-mL, one-necked, round bottomed flask and is purified by short path distillation under high vacuum (3 × 10−2 mmHg) to give 16.72 g (81%) of 3-(mesitylamino)butan-2-one as a pale yellow oil, bp 94-98 °C.
The product can be purified by recrystallization from 60 per cent ethyl alcohol, using approximately 70 cc. of the solvent to 25 g. of the distilled product. One such recrystallization gives white leaflets melting at 53–55° and. The yield of recrystallized material from a single run is 315–320 g.
A. p,α,α-Tribromoacetophenone. In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a gas outlet leading to a hood or trap are placed 100 g. (0.5 mole) of p-bromoacetophenone and 300 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled to 20°, and a solution of 26 ml. (0.5 mole) of bromine in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise. Crystals of the mono-α-brominated derivative separate during the addition, which requires about 30 minutes. When the addition is completed, a second solution of 26 ml. (0.5 mole) of bromine in 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise. Slight heating may be necessary to keep the reaction proceeding, as indicated by decolorization of the bromine, but the temperature should be kept as near 20° as possible. During the addition, which requires about 30 minutes, the solid dissolves and crystals of the di-α,α-brominated derivative appear toward the end of the addition. The flask is heated to dissolve the contents, which are transferred, preferably in a hood, to a 1-l. beaker and cooled rapidly by means of an ice-water bath. The mixture is filtered with suction, and the solid is washed with 50% ethanol until colorless. The air-dried product has a slight pink cast and melts at 89–91°. The yield is 130–135 g. (73–75%). A pure, white solid melting at 92–94° is obtained by recrystallization from ethanol, but the initial product is sufficiently pure for the next step.
The mixture is allowed to stand for twenty-four hours, and is then poured into a 5-l. flask containing 650 g. of ice and 25 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. One liter of benzene is then added, and the mixture heated on a steam bath under a return condenser. After gently boiling for five or ten minutes, the mixture is allowed to cool to 40–50°, when the benzene layer is separated, washed with 700 cc. of warm water containing 25 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and distilled. After the benzene has been removed under atmospheric pressure, the residue is transferred to a 300-cc. flask and distilled under reduced pressure, and a fraction boiling over the range 190–215°/10 mm. collected. This weighs 135–160 g.; it solidifies on cooling. It is recrystallized from 550–650 cc. of ethyl alcohol, and a colorless product, crystallizing in needles which melt sharply at 92°, is obtained. This is filtered off and washed twice with 30-cc. portions of fresh alcohol. The alcoholic mother liquor is concentrated and the residue distilled under reduced pressure, material which distils over at 190–200°/10 mm. being collected. This is recrystallized from ethyl alcohol, and 6–7 g. more of pure material is thus obtained. The total yield of recrystallized product is 125–154 g. (68–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-cc. Claisen flask is arranged for distilling the solvent and the solution is dropped in from the funnel at such a rate that the flask is never more than two-thirds full. The Claisen flask is heated in an oil bath, and the carbon tetrachloride distils when the oil bath reaches about 120°. As much as possible of the solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure by allowing the temperature of the oil bath to rise to 150°. The remainder of the carbon tetrachloride is removed under a pressure of about 20 mm. by collecting a fraction until the thermometer registers a sudden rise (temperature of the oil bath about 120°).
The flask is heated on an electric stove, and a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, clamped to a ring stand, is placed on the funnel to act as a condenser, cold water being run through the flask. The toluene is boiled until the condensed liquid runs through almost colorless (this requires from four to ten hours). The heating is then discontinued, and, as soon as the liquid ceases to boil, the flask is removed to a bath containing water at 90–100°; the level of the water should be slightly above the level of the liquid in the flask. This arrangement permits the temperature to fall slowly so that large crystals are obtained. In the meantime a second conical flask containing 1250 cc. of toluene is attached to the funnel, and a new charge of 150 g. of crude methyl red is placed in the paper. The process is repeated until all the crude material has been so treated. When extraction is complete it is found that a certain amount of black amorphous insoluble matter remains on the filter; this is discarded. The crystals of methyl red are filtered off and washed with a little toluene. The weight of pure material is 755–805 g. The mother liquors are concentrated to one-fourth of their volume, and the crystals which separate on cooling are recrystallized from fresh toluene. The recovered toluene can, of course, be employed again. The total yield of pure methyl red is 790–840 g. (62–66 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts at 181–182°.
Sixty-nine grams (3 gram atoms) of sodium is powdered under xylene in a 3-l. three-necked flask. The mixture is cooled, the xylene is decanted, and the sodium is washed twice with small portions of dry ether. One liter of absolute ether is then added to the powdered sodium. The flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, an efficient reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, the condenser and the funnel being protected from moisture with calcium chloride tubes. One hundred and thirty-eight grams (175 cc., 3 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol is added drop by drop through the funnel. After the alcohol has been added and there is no unchanged sodium (as evidenced by cessation of boiling) the flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and a mixture of 306 g. (3 moles) of ethyl propionate and 438 g. (3 moles) of ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261) is added slowly through the dropping funnel.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, liquid-sealed stirrer, and dropping funnel is placed 13 g. (0.53 gram atom) of magnesium turnings. A few cubic centimeters of a solution of 60 g. (42 cc., 0.55 mole) of pure ethyl bromide in 50 cc. of absolute ether is added and the stirrer started. When the bromide begins to react 200 cc. of absolute ether is added, and then the balance of the bromide solution is run in as fast as the refluxing permits (about one-half hour). After allowing fifteen minutes for the completion of the reaction, a solution of 40 g. (0.42 mole) of 2,4-dimethylpyrrole (p. 217) in 100 cc. of absolute ether is added in the course of twenty minutes and the mixture is refluxed for one-half hour on the steam bath.
The crude white product is dissolved in 150 ml. of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°). On cooling, it forms a solid cake which is transferred to a Buchner funnel and rinsed with small portions of cooled petroleum ether. The yield of product, m.p. 75–78°, is 57–61 g. (73–78%). It has an approximate composition of 99.3% trans alcohol, 0.3% cis alcohol, and 0.4% ketone. A further crop of 12 g. is obtained by concentration of the mother liquor. It contains less than 1% of the cis alcohol and the ketone and is sufficiently pure for most preparative purposes.
B. (2S)-2-Methyl-2-(2-propen-1-yl)-cyclohexanone. A flame-dried, 50-mL, conical flask equipped with a rubber septum is charged with a portion of 1-methyl-2-oxo-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid 2-propenyl ester, placed under vacuum (0.06 mmHg) for 60 min to remove any dissolved gases, and then backfilled with argon. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stir bar, two rubber septa, and a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold. The apparatus is flame-dried under vacuum and backfilled with dry argon (three cycles). After cooling the flask to ambient temperature, 435 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added and the flask is immersed in a 30 °C water bath. A twelve-inch needle is inserted through one of the septa and used to bubble dry argon gas through the liquid for 30 min. The needle is removed and then 1.02 g of tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (Pd2(dba)3, 1.11 mmol, 0.0125 equiv) and 1.03 g of (S)-tert-ButylPHOX (2.67 mmol, 0.030 equiv) are added. The mixture immediately became opaque and took on a golden-brown color. This mixture is stirred at 30 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, neat 1-methyl-2-oxo-cyclohexanecarboxylic acid 2-propenyl ester (17.5 g, 89.03 mmol, 1.00 equiv) from the conical flask is added via syringe in a dropwise fashion to the catalyst mixture over the course of 10 min.
A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser leading to a nitrogen inlet and a septum. A Teflon-coated thermocouple is introduced into the flask through the septum. The septum is removed and the flask is charged with toluene (515 mL). A second nitrogen source is introduced into the solution through a 12-in., 16-gauge needle, and the solution is vigorously purged with nitrogen for 5 min. To this mixture is immediately added via syringe 0.6 M sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide in toluene (157.5 mL, 94.5 mmol, Note 10). While the solution is stirred vigorously, 1-butanethiol (10.1 mL, 94.5 mmol) is added over the course of 3 min. A gel-like solid forms and the internal temperature increases from 21°C to 28°C.
A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a reflux condenser is charged with 49.0 g. (0.250 mole) of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylacetic acid and 125 ml. of acetic acid. The solution is stirred and heated at 80° on a steam bath, while 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added rapidly and followed immediately with 40 ml. of formalin (37% formaldehyde, by weight, in water) and. The yellow solution is stirred and heated on a steam bath for 1 hour, during which time the reaction temperature reaches 90° and the solution assumes a dark-brown color. After cooling to room temperature the solution is poured, with stirring, into a mixture of 650 g. of chipped ice and 650 ml. of cold water. The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the organic material is extracted with four 300-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are washed with 250-ml. portions of aqueous 5% sodium hydrogen carbonate until neutral, then with two, 250-ml. portions of water, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator with a water bath up to a temperature of 55°, yielding 43.5–44.2 g. (83.7–85.1%) of crude 6,7-dimethoxy-3-isochromanone, m.p. 95–100°, as a yellow solid suitable for general synthetic purposes. A purer product is obtained by recrystallization from 55 ml. of ethanol,(Note 9),(Note 10), giving 26–27.6 g. of white crystals which, after drying at 80°, melt at 106–108°. Upon concentration of the mother liquor to a smaller volume, an additional 1.7–3.2 g. of the isochromanone, m.p. 103–105°, is obtained. The total yield is 29.2–29.3 g. (56.2–56.4%).
(B) Citraconic Acid.—To 22.4 g. (0.2 mole) of pure citraconic anhydride in a 100-cc. beaker is added from a pipet exactly 4 cc. (0.22 mole) of distilled water. The mixture is stirred on a hot plate until a homogeneous solution is formed, then covered with a watch glass and allowed to stand for forty-eight hours. At the end of this time the mixture has solidified completely. The yield is 26 g. of a product melting at 87–89°. For further purification it is finely ground in a mortar, washed with 50 cc. of cold benzene, dried in the air, and then dried for twenty-four hours in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide. This furnishes 24.4 g. (94 per cent of the theoretical amount) of citraconic acid which melts at 92–93°.
A. Disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate. A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a three-way stopcock with one branch connected to a nitrogen source, and a Y-shaped adapter fitted with a reflux condenser vented through an oil bubbler and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped by a rubber septum. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen for 15 minutes and charged with 600 ml. of dry, deoxygenated dioxane and, 10.6 g. (0.461 g.-atoms) of sodium, and 9.1 g. (0.050 mole) of benzophenone. The solution is stirred vigorously and heated under reflux with a heating mantle until the deep blue color of the benzophenone ketyl appears. With a gas-tight syringe, 45.3 g. (29.8 ml., 0.231 mole) of iron pentacarbonyl is injected into the dropping funnel. The blue solution is then titrated to a white or slightly yellow end point by adding iron pentacarbonyl to the refluxing solution over 2.5 hours. The suspension is heated at reflux for another 45 minutes, then cooled to room temperature. Precipitation of the disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate as a white powder is completed by adding 600 ml. of dry, deoxygenated hexane and. The Y-shaped adapter and the mechanical stirrer are removed under a rapid stream of nitrogen and quickly replaced with a tight-fitting rubber septum and a gas-dispersion tube with a fritted-glass tip (see Figure 1). The solvent is forced up the gas-dispersion tube and out of the flask with nitrogen pressure. The product is washed in the flask with two 400-ml. portions of hexane added via a cannula, and the supernatant solvent is removed with nitrogen pressure in the same manner. The disodium tetracarbonylferrate sesquidioxanate is used directly in Parts B and C without drying or weighing.
A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, an inlet for dry nitrogen, and a mechanical stirrer is flushed with dry nitrogen. It is then charged with 340 g. (4.00 moles) of piperidine 4.4 g. (0.19 g. atom) of sodium, and 5.0 g. (5.1 ml., 0.063 mole) of pyridine. While a slow stream of nitrogen continues to pass through the flask, the solution is heated under reflux with high-speed stirring for approximately 10 minutes. During this time most of the sodium reacts without evolution of hydrogen, and the dispersion darkens. The dispersion, which contains some finely divided solids, is cooled and transferred to a 2-l. stirred autoclave under nitrogen. An additional 85 g. (1.00 mole) of piperidine is used to wash the last portions of the dispersion into the autoclave.
D. (S)-5-Pyrrolidin-2-yl-1H-tetrazole (5). A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar is charged with a solution of (S)-2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)-pyrrolidin-1-carboxylic acid benzyl ester (4) (15.33 g, 56.1 mmol) in ethanol (255 mL). Palladium-on-carbon (10 wt %, 1.49 g) is added to the solution under an argon atmosphere. The flask is evacuated and purged with hydrogen gas five times on a hydrogen manifold. The mixture is then stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 20-24 h. After complete conversion (as monitored by thin layer chromatography, Note 45), the catalyst is removed by filtration through Celite using a medium-porosity fritted funnel, and the Celite is washed sequentially with ethanol (30 mL), acetic acid (10 mL) and water (50 mL), and then again with ethanol (30 mL), acetic acid (10 mL) and water (50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator (45 °C, 115 mmHg to remove ethanol, then 45 °C, 50 mmHg to remove water, then 45 °C, 22 mmHg to remove acetic acid), and then is dried under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) at room temperature for 13 h in a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask to afford 7.12-7.68 g (91-98%) of crude 5 as a pale brown solid. Ethanol (25 mL) is then added and a reflux condenser is attached to the flask. The suspension is heated in a 90 °C oil bath for 1 h, then is allowed to cool to room temperature before being cooled in the freezer (−23 °C) for 15 h. The precipitate is isolated by suction filtration, then is washed with cold ethanol (2 × 10 mL) and then dried in a round bottom flask in a 40 °C oil bath (with a magnetic stirrer) under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) for 5 h, to furnish 6.09–6.94 g (78-89% over two steps) of 5 as a white solid.
4. Preparation of (S,S)-2,2'-Bispyrrolidine To a solution of the tartrate salt (9.3 g) in water (15 mL) at 0 °C are added KOH pellets (20 g). The mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 10 min before diethyl ether (80 mL) is added, whereupon it is stirred at 0 °C for another 30 min. The aqueous layer is separated and then is extracted with diethyl ether (6 × 50 mL). The diethyl ether extracts are combined, dried (K2CO3) and then are concentrated in vacuo. The residue is then transferred to a dry 25-mL, round-bottomed flask. To this is added a piece of sodium and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 30 min. The residue is then distilled under vacuum to give 3.51 g (80%) of (S,S)-2,2'-bispyrrolidine as a clear, colorless oil (bp 97–98 °C at 8.0 mmHg). The enantiomeric purity of product is determined by CSP-SFC and CSP-HPLC analysis of corresponding dibenzoyl amide derivative.
Through the separatory funnel is then added 200 cc. of water, and the reaction mixture is heated for another hour. The flask should be shaken occasionally during this time. The reaction mixture is cooled to about 50° and filtered. The solid is returned to the flask and heated for ten minutes with a fresh 500-cc. portion of benzene to dissolve any remaining pinacol. The original filtrate and the second portion of benzene, after it is filtered from the magnesium hydroxide, are mixed and distilled to one-half the original volume in order to remove the acetone; the remaining benzene solution is treated with 300 cc. of water and cooled to 10–15°. The pinacol hydrate separates, and after about thirty minutes it is collected on a suction filter and washed with benzene, or better, the mixture is centrifuged in a basket centrifuge. The pinacol hydrate, air-dried at room temperature, weighs 325–375 g. (43–50 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the magnesium used). The product melts at 46–47°. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes. Occasionally the product is slightly yellow. If such a product is dissolved in an equal weight of boiling water, treated with a little animal charcoal, filtered, and the filtrate cooled in ice, over 95 per cent of the material may be recovered in large white crystals.
The ammonium salt is dissolved in three parts of hot water, ammonia is added if necessary to effect complete solution at 60°, the solution is again treated with sodium hydrosulfite and 3–4 g. of decolorizing charcoal, filtered hot, and the 5-iodoanthranilic acid is precipitated by adding c.p. hydrochloric acid in 3- to 5-cc. portions, stirring thoroughly after each addition, until the reaction mixture is just faintly acid to Congo red. Ice is then added until the temperature is reduced to 20°, and the precipitated acid is removed by suction filtration, washed freely with cold water, and dried at 100–110°. 5-Iodoanthranilic acid is almost quantitatively precipitated from its ammonium salt solution and is obtained as a yellow powder, m.p. 190–195° (decomp.).
(B) Preparation of Glycine.—To a boiling suspension of 253 g. (0.8 mole) of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 500 cc. of water in a 1-l. beaker is added, in portions, 61.6 g. (0.4 mole) of aminoacetonitrile hydrogen sulfate at such a rate that the mixture does not froth over. The beaker is then covered with a 1-l. round-bottomed flask containing cold running water, and boiling is continued until no more ammonia is evolved. This requires six to eight hours. The barium is then quantitatively precipitated by the addition of exactly the necessary amount of 50 per cent sulfuric acid. The filtrate is concentrated on a water bath to a volume of 50–75 cc.; on chilling, crude glycine crystallizes and is filtered off. The filtrate is again concentrated and chilled and the crystals removed. This process is continued until the final filtrate amounts to about 5 cc. The yield of crude glycine so obtained amounts to 25–27 g. This is systematically recrystallized from water, decolorizing with Norite and collecting the material which melts (with decomposition) at 246° (corr.) or above. Washing of the successive crops with 50 per cent ethyl alcohol is of great assistance in freeing the crystals of mother liquor. The yield of pure glycine is 20–26 g. (67–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(R)-(−)-BNP ACID. The filtrate from the initial crystallization of the cinchonine salt is evaporated nearly to dryness to give 107 g of crude salt, [α]54625 −113° (methanol, c 0.95), consisting of approximately 81% n salt and 19% p salt and. A 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with addition funnel, reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, and thermometer is charged with 107 g of the crude salt and 700 mL of ethanol. The salt is dissolved by heating to reflux, and 790 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid is added with vigorous stirring over the course of 30 min. The temperature is maintained at 75–80°C during the addition, and the acid begins to precipitate. Once the addition is complete, the solution is allowed to cool without stirring to room temperature. The solid is collected, washed with water (5 × 100 mL), and air-dried to afford 23.3 g of (−)-BNP acid, [α]54625 −717° (methanol, c 1.00). The yield based on enantiomer present in the racemate is 49%. The product is free from contamination by cinchonine, as shown by 1H NMR (Me2SO, 250 MHz) and elemental analysis. HPLC analysis of the methyl ester derivative employing a chiral stationary phase shows the acid to be 100.0% ee.
If pure ester is desired, it may be obtained by recrystallizing from petroleum ether (b.p. 70–90°); the yield is 80–85 g. of ester melting at 74–75° from 100 g. of crude product.
A 500-mL, oven-dried, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, a thermocouple and an argon gas inlet is charged with the crude product prepared above (9.43 g), MeOH (60 mL), and trimethyl orthoformate (40 mL). To the mixture is added pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (1.01 g, 4.03 mmol). After being heated in a 50 °C oil bath (internal temperature: 43 °C) for 3.5 h, the solution is cooled to ambient temperature and is poured into sat. aq. NaHCO3 solution (100 mL) in a 1-L separatory funnel. The two-phase mixture is extracted with EtOAc (3 × 100 mL) and the combined organic extracts are washed with sat. aq. NaCl solution (2 × 100 mL), then are dried over Na2SO4 (2.2 g), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (20 °C, 30 mmHg). The residue is dissolved with toluene (50 mL) and the resulting solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (40 °C, 30 mmHg) to give a yellow oil (10.07 g). The oil is purified by silica gel column chromatography (elution with hexanes/EtOAc, 20:1) to yield (4-(dimethoxymethyl)phenoxy)(tert-butyl)dimethyl silane (9.66 g, 85%).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stopper holding a dropping funnel and a mechanical stirrer, is placed a mixture of 275 cc. (4.3 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) and 275 cc. (4.9 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). This is cooled to 10° in a freezing mixture, and 100 g. (0.85 mole) of benzyl cyanide (free from alcohol and water) is run in slowly, at such a rate that the temperature remains at about 10° and does not exceed 20°. After all the benzyl cyanide has been added (about one hour), the ice bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for one hour and then poured onto 1200 g. of crushed ice. A pasty mass slowly separates; more than half of this mass is p-nitrobenzyl cyanide, the other constituents being o-nitrobenzyl cyanide, and a variable amount of an oil which resists hydrolysis; apparently no dinitro compounds are formed. The mass is filtered on a porcelain funnel with suction, pressed well to remove as much oil as possible, and dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol. On cooling, p-nitrobenzyl cyanide crystallizes; the mother liquor, on distillation, gives an impure alcohol which can be used for the next run. Recrystallization from 550 cc. of 80 per cent alcohol (sp. gr. 0.86 to 0.87) yields 70–75 g. (50–54 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 115–116°.
A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 25-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a Claisen adapter fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter and a low-temperature thermometer. The flask is charged with 115 g (0.077 mol) of (R)-(−)-carvone, 10.8 g (0.079 mol) of 1-methyl-1-(trimethylsilyl)allene, and 180 mL of dry dichloromethane, and then cooled below −75°C with a dry ice–acetone bath while a solution of 17.4 g (0.092 mol) of titanium tetrachloride in 10 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise over 1 hr. After 30 min, the cold bath is removed, and the reaction mixture, which appears as a red suspension, is allowed to warm to 0°C over approximately 30 min. The resulting dark red solution is poured slowly into a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask containing a magnetically stirred mixture of 400 mL of diethyl ether and 400 mL of water. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with 250 mL of water and 250 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residual yellow liquid is distilled through a 15-cm Vigreux column at reduced pressure to afford 17.5 g (82%) of the bicyclonoenone 1 as a very-pale-yellow liquid, bp 98–101°C (0.03 mm), [α]D20 −157.8 ± 0.8 (1.57, CH2Cl2) and.
A. Acetone carboxymethoxime. A mixture of 612 g. (4.4 moles) of bromoacetic acid and 500 g. of crushed ice is chilled in an ice-salt bath and made distinctly alkaline to litmus with sodium hydroxide (about 440 g. of a 40% solution). During the neutralization an additional 500 g. of ice is added. To the solution are then added 292 g. (4.0 moles) of acetoxime1 and 440 g. of 40% sodium hydroxide (4.4 moles), the temperature being held below 20° during the addition of the alkali. The mixture is then allowed to flow dropwise, during 3–4 hours, through the inner tube of a steam-heated Liebig condenser (jacket 75 cm. long; inner tube 10-mm. diameter; angle of inclination about 20°) into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask cooled with running water. The resulting solution is extracted three times with 500-ml. quantities of freshly distilled peroxide-free ether, and the aqueous solution is then cooled and made strongly acid by the addition of 500 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (6 moles). During the acidification the temperature should not rise above 15°. The solution is saturated with sodium chloride and immediately extracted with six successive 1.5-l. portions of peroxide-free ether. The ether is distilled from the combined ethereal extracts, and the residue, consisting of the crude acetone carboxymethoxime (333–345 g.), is used for the next step. The acetone carboxymethoxime may be purified by distillation under reduced pressure, the fraction boiling at 95–97°/1 mm. being collected. The yield is 300 g. (57%) of a colorless product melting at 76°.
A. 1-[(Isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl]cyclohexanol. A 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a magnetic stirrer, a three-way stopcock, and a reflux condenser connected with a nitrogen bubbler. The flask is charged with magnesium turnings (2.43 g, 100 mg-atm) that are dried under a rapid stream of nitrogen with a heat gun. After the flask is cooled to room temperature, the rate of nitrogen flow is reduced. Several milliliters of a solution of (isopropoxydimethylsilyl)methyl chloride (16.67 g, 100 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (120 mL) and about 50 μL of 1,2-dibromoethane are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature and within a few minutes an exothermic reaction starts. The remaining solution is added dropwise at room temperature over ca. 45 min at such a rate as to maintain a gently exothermic reaction. After the addition is complete, the tan-gray mixture is refluxed for 0.5 hr and then cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. A solution of freshly distilled cyclohexanone (7.36 g, 75 mmol) in dry THF (30 mL) is added dropwise with stirring over 30 min. The resultant mixture is stirred at 0°C for another 30 min and then hydrolyzed by dropwise addition of an aqueous 10% solution of ammonium chloride (100 mL) at 0°C over 10 min. The organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with four 40-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layer and extracts are washed once with aqueous saturated sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated with a rotary evaporator below room temperature at water aspirator pressure. A colorless oil remains.
In a 5-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 2.5 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 340 g. (4.5 moles) of commercial (73–75 per cent) potassium hydroxide. The mixture is gently shaken until the hydroxide is dissolved, 1330 g. (1.5 l., approximately 4 equivalents) of rape-seed oil is added with shaking, and the mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for twenty-five to thirty hours.
A. Methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate. To a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser and addition funnel, is added methyl 2-methyl-3-nitrobenzoate (19.1 g, 97.9 mmol,), dibenzoyl peroxide (1.21 g, 5.00 mmol,), and 100 mL of carbon tetrachloride. The mixture is heated to reflux, and a clear, pale yellow solution is formed. A solution of bromine (16.1 g, 100.6 mmol) in 20 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added over 10 min to the boiling solution under irradiation using a 100-W flood lamp. The reaction mixture is heated and irradiated for 24 hr. The resulting orange solution is allowed to cool to ambient temperature; 50 mL of dichloromethane is added, and the solution is washed with three 50-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase is dried (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator affording 25.90 g (96.5%) of methyl 2-bromomethyl-3-nitrobenzoate as pale yellow crystals. The material is used in the next step without further purification.
C. (1S,2S,3R)-3-Hydroxy-2-nitrocyclohexyl acetate. A 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is charged with 10 g (41 mmol) of powdered nitrodiacetate and 300 mL of 0.2 M phosphate buffer of pH 7.0 prepared by dissolving 11 g of potassium dihydrogenphosphate and 3.3 g of potassium hydroxide in 300 mL of deionized (or distilled) water. To the stirred suspension is added 30 mg of purified PLE [Esterase (EC 3.1.1.1), suspended in 2.8 mL of 3.2 M ammonium sulfate buffer] and the mixture is stirred for 24 to 48 hr. The continuously measured pH drops to about 5.6 during the reaction and then remains almost constant, while the mixture has turned to a practically clear, pale-yellow solution. The solution is filtered through a paper filter and the filtrate is extracted 3 times with 100 mL of ether. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered. Removal of the solvent and of the acetic acid under reduced pressure leaves 7–8 g (85–95%) of colorless monoacetate as a crystalline solid. Recrystallization by dissolving in 100 mL of ether and adding 250 mL of pentane gives 5–6 g (60–70%) of pure (1S,2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-nitrocyclohexyl acetate, mp 90–91°C, [α]D + 9.5° (CHCl3, c 1.0). From the mother liquor, another 1–2 g (12–24%) of monoacetate, mp 89–90°C, can be obtained.
The hottest part of the tube, which is near the middle of the heated section, is maintained at 550° ± 10° while dry oxygen-free nitrogen is passed successively through a flowmeter and the tube at about 150 ml. per hr. for at least 30 minutes. The dropping funnel is charged with 56 g. (0.67 mole) of diketene and, which is then introduced into the hot tube at a rate of about 0.5 ml. per min. while the nitrogen flow continues. Essentially pure ketene, yield 26–31 g. (46–55%), collects in the dry-ice trap as a colorless or nearly colorless liquid. The ketene is distilled directly from this trap for use in reactions.
E. Dimethyl 4-phenyl-1,2-diazine-3,6-dicarboxylate. A 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with dimethyl 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate (1.0 g, 0.005 mol) and 1,4-dioxane (20 mL,). 1-Phenyl-1-(trimethylsiloxy)ethylene (1.07 g, 0.0056 mol, 1.14 mL,) is added and the reaction mixture is stirred under nitrogen at room temperature for 8 hr. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a viscous oil that is triturated with anhydrous ether (2–3 mL). The solid product is collected by vacuum filtration and recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexane to give 1.23–1.30 g (90–96%) of dimethyl 4-phenyl-1,2-diazine-3,6-dicarboxylate as a light yellow solid, mp 95.5–96°C.
A mixture of 30.0 g. (0.5 mole) of anhydrous isopropyl alcohol and 65.0 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate is placed in a 500-ml. round-bottomed three-necked flask equipped with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a gas inlet tube terminating about 1 cm. above the surface of the liquid, a gas outlet tube connected with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer. The gas inlet tube is connected to a source of boron fluorides, and an ice bath is applied to the reaction flask; when the temperature of the stirred mixture has fallen to approximately 0° the stream of boron fluoride is started and adjusted so that the temperature of the mixture does not exceed 7°. The addition of boron fluoride is continued until the mixture is saturated and for 15 minutes thereafter. The reaction mixture then is stirred at 28° for 2.5 hours, at the end of which period it is poured slowly into a stirred mixture of 130 g. of hydrated sodium acetate, 100 ml. of water, and 200 g. of crushed ice. The beaker containing the resulting mixture is allowed to stand in an ice bath for 2 hours with occasional stirring.
A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 20-cm Vigreux column, column head, Claisen distilling head, and thermometer, is charged with 89.3 g (602 mmol) of triethyl orthoformate, 180 g (2.95 mol) of nitromethane, and 5.00 g (36.6 mmol) of anhydrous zinc chloride. The solution is heated to 90°C (oil bath temperature,). After 16 hr (overnight) ca. 30 mL of ethanol is collected. The remaining mixture, a brown suspension, is cooled to room temperature, and filtered by suction through a sintered glass funnel. The brown liquid obtained is distilled from a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask through a 20-cm Vigreux column at reduced pressure. First, excess nitromethane is removed (bp ca. 30°C/35 mm), then the fraction boiling at 58–60°C/1 mm is collected to afford 39–41 g (40–42% yield) of nitroacetaldehyde diethyl acetal 1 as a colorless liquid,.
To a solution of 33 g. (0.5 mole) of potassium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of distilled water in a 5-l. flask or other appropriate container fitted with a mechanical stirrer is added 80 g. (0.5 mole) of methyl hydrogen adipate. With continuous stirring a solution of 85 g. (0.5 mole) of silver nitrate in 1 l. of distilled water is added rapidly (about 15 minutes). The precipitated methyl silver adipate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with methanol, and dried in an oven at 50–60°. For the next step the dried silver salt is finely powdered and sieved through a 40-mesh screen. The combined yield from two such runs is 213 g. (80%).
(A) Nitrosothymol.—To a solution of 100 g. (0.66 mole) of thymol in 500 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. This mixture is cooled to 0° in a 2-l. beaker set in an ice-salt bath, and to it is added 72 g. (1 mole) of commercial sodium nitrite in portions of about 5 g. each.
B. 4,4'-Dimethoxy-1,1'-biphenyl. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a stopper, and a reflux condenser fitted with a two-way stopcock, one end of which is connected to an aspirator, and the other to a cylinder of dry, oxygen-free nitrogen. To this flask are added 60 g. of Raney nickel and 150 ml. of benzene. The system is flushed with nitrogen, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The Raney nickel is then degassed behind an explosion shield in a hood by heating to 200° (2 mm.) for 2 hours.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 120 g. (1.83 moles) of 92% ethylenediamine, 300 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 300 ml. of water. The flask is attached to an efficient reflux condenser, and 121 ml. of carbon disulfide is placed in a separatory funnel attached to the top of the condenser by means of a notched cork. About 15 to 20 ml. of the carbon disulfide is added, and the flask is shaken to mix the contents. A vigorous reaction takes place, and it may be necessary to cool the flask. After the reaction has started, a water bath at 60° is placed under the flask and the balance of the carbon disulfide is added at such a rate that the vapors reflux about one-third the way up the condenser. About 2 hours is required for the addition of the carbon disulfide. At this time the bath temperature is raised to about 100°, and the mixture is allowed to reflux for 1 hour. Then 15 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added, and the mixture is refluxed under a good hood (bath at 100°) for 9–10 hours. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and the product is filtered by suction on a Büchner funnel and washed with 200–300 ml. of cold acetone. A yield of 156–167 g. (83–89%) of white crystals is obtained melting at 197–198° and.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a very efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a 500-cc. separatory funnel, are placed 445 g. (5.5 moles) of sodium thiocyanate and 1250 cc. of 90 per cent ethyl alcohol. The stirrer is started and the mixture is heated to boiling. Then 615 g. (5 moles) of isopropyl bromide (p. 359; Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 37) is added slowly during the course of one hour. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for six hours. At the end of this time the precipitated sodium bromide is removed by filtration and washed with 250 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. As much of the alcohol as possible is then removed by distillation on the steam bath. To the residue in the flask is added 500 cc. of water, and the upper layer of isopropyl thiocyanate is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are added to the crude thiocyanate, and the combined product is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried material is fractionated twice from a modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating column. The following fractions are collected: up to 60°; 60–100°; 100–130°; 130–146°; and 146–151°. The last fraction contains the pure product. The yield is 320–345 g. (63–68 per cent of the theoretical amount). By redistilling the alcohol that was removed on the steam bath through an efficient fractionating column until all the alcohol is removed, separating the water, and distilling, there is obtained an additional 55–65 g. of product boiling at 146–151°. The total yield is 385–400 g. (76–79 per cent of the theoretical amount). On redistillation of the combined fractions boiling at 146–151°, practically the entire amount distils at 149–151°.
[18]Annulene is best stored in benzene–ether solution in the refrigerator. The crystals can also be kept for some time in the refrigerator, small crystals being less stable than large ones.2 Material that has decomposed to some extent may be purified as follows. The substance (300 mg.) is broken up with a spatula and heated with 30 ml. of benzene, and the insoluble material is removed by filtration. The filtrate is poured onto a chromatography column (20 × 1.8 cm.), prepared with 35 g. of alumina and benzene. The column is washed with benzene until the eluate is colorless. Polymeric material is retained at the top of the column. The eluent is concentrated to approximately 6 ml., diluted with 20 ml. of ether, and cooled in an ice–salt bath. The resulting crystals of [18]annulene are collected on a sintered glass funnel, washed with 3 ml. of cold (−20°) ether, and dried in air for a few minutes.
1-[Hydroxy(tosyloxy)iodo]-3-trifluoromethylbenzene (1). A 250-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar (3.5 cm, egg-shaped) is charged with m-chloroperbenzoic acid (m-CPBA, 4.18 g, 17 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE, 65 mL). The mixture is dissolved by sonication (approx. 20 min) and the concentration of mCPBA is determined by iodometric titration of the solution. 3-Iodobenzotrifluoride (2.45 mL, 1.71 g, 17.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (3.23 g, 17.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) are added to the solution. The flask is loosely capped with a septum, and the reaction mixture is lowered into a 40 ºC preheated oil bath and stirred vigorously during 1 h. The solvent is then removed by distillation to recover the TFE, or evaporated under reduced pressure if TFE recovery is not of interest. After concentration, diethyl ether (65 mL) is added to the residue and the mixture is allowed to stir for 30 min, resulting in trituration of the product as a white solid. The product is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel, followed by washing with diethyl ether (65 mL). The product is vacuum-dried at room temperature (<1 mmHg, 22 ºC) to afford compound 1 as a white solid (7.66 g, 97%).
B. 2-Bromo-3,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-yl acetate. A 250-ml. flask equipped with a condenser is charged with 17.6 g. (0.0500 mole) of 1,1-dibromo-2,2-diphenylcyclopropane, 12.5 g. (0.0748 mole) of silver acetate, and 50 ml. of glacial acetic acid, then immersed in an oil bath at 100–120° for 24 hours. After cooling, the mixture is diluted with 200 ml. of diethyl ether and filtered. The ethereal filtrate is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, two 100-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium carbonate, and finally with two 100-ml. portions of water. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the ether is removed on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the resulting residue under reduced pressure yields 12.0 g. (72%) of the product, b.p. 142–145° (0.15 mm.), n22D 1.6020–1.6023.
A dry, 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 1-L pressure-equalizing funnel and a large magnetic stirring bar. The system is flame-dried under an internal atmosphere of dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 300 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 100 g of monoethyl fumarate. The solution is then stirred under nitrogen and brought to about −5°C using an ice–salt/methanol bath (−10°C). A 1 M solution of 700 mL (0.70 mol) of borane–tetrahydrofuran complex is cautiously added dropwise (rapid H2 evolution occurs) with rigorous temperature control to avoid an exothermic reaction. The ice–salt bath is maintained in position throughout the 90 min of addition. The stirred reaction mixture is then gradually allowed to warm to room temperature over the next 8–10 hr. The reaction is carefully quenched at room temperature by dropwise addition of 1 : 1 water : acetic acid (ca. 20 mL) with stirring until no more gas evolution occurs. The reaction is concentrated at room temperature and water pump pressure to a slurry by removal of most of the tetrahydrofuran. The slurry is carefully poured over a 20-min period into 300 mL of ice-cold, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution with mechanical stirring to avoid precipitation of solids, and the product is extracted with 300 mL of ethyl acetate. The aqueous layer is again extracted with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic layers are combined, washed once with 200 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate, then dried well with anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
The cooled mixture is next poured, with stirring, upon a mixture of 1 kg. of crushed ice, 1 l. of water, and 200 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After stirring a few minutes to dissolve the sludge, the major part of the water layer is siphoned off and the ethereal solution is separated. The water layer is washed once with about 50 cc. of ether, and this washing is added to the ethereal solution of n-propylbenzene. The ether is removed by distillation from a water or steam bath through a fractionating column. The residue is poured into 1 l. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution in about 50 per cent alcohol, and this mixture is refluxed for one hour. After the n-propylbenzene is thrown out by the addition of a large volume of water, the hydrocarbon is separated, combined with an ether extract of the aqueous layer, dried by standing over 10–15 g. of solid potassium hydroxide, and fractionally distilled through an efficient column. The yield of n-propylbenzene, distilling at 155–160°, is 165–180 g. (70–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A dry, 500-ml., two-necked flask containing 6.75 g. (0.0500 mole) of N,N-dimethyl-p-toluidine and 175 ml. of anhydrous hexane is fitted with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel capped with a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet tube. The reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen, and a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained within the apparatus for the remainder of the reaction sequence. A solution of 8.8 g. (0.076 mole of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylenediamine in 40 ml. of anhydrous hexane is added to the dropping funnel, followed by a hexane solution containing 0.076 mole of n-butyllithium. The resulting solution, which becomes warm as the organolithium-diamine complex forms, is allowed to stand for 15 minutes, then added to the reaction mixture, dropwise and with stirring over 15–20 minutes. The resulting bright yellow, turbid reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 4 hours longer before a solution of 13.8 g. (0.0758 mole) of benzophenone in 40 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added to the reaction mixture, dropwise and with stirring over 20 minutes. The resulting, deep-green solution is stirred for an additional 20 minutes, then poured into a vigorously stirred solution of 12 g. (0.20 mole) of acetic acid in 30 ml. of ether. After the reaction solution has been successively extracted with 50 ml. of water and four 50-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, the aqueous extracts are combined and made basic with aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide. The alkaline mixture is heated to boiling and maintained at this temperature until the escaping vapor is no longer basic to moistened pHydrion paper. The mixture is then cooled, and the white solid product which separates is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with three 20-ml. portions of water. The crude product (m.p. 142–168°) is recrystallized from 250 ml. of 3 : 1 (v/v) hexane-ethyl acetate, giving 6.6–8.2 g. of the amino alcohol product as colorless prisms, m.p. 168–171°. Concentration of the mother liquors gives an additional 0.8–1.2 g. of product, m.p. 167–169°, for a total yield of 7.8–9.0 g. (49–57%). Although the product is sufficiently pure for most purposes, a second recrystallization from hexane-ethyl acetate raises the melting point to 169.5–172°.
(B) Unsymmetrical o-Phthalyl Chloride.—A mixture of 105 g. of the symmetrical o-phthalyl chloride and 75 g. of finely ground aluminum chloride is heated on a steam bath for eight to ten hours, with exclusion of moisture. The mixture should be stirred frequently until all the powder has dissolved. Upon cooling there is formed a hard mass which is broken into small pieces while still warm. When thoroughly cool, it is triturated with pieces of ice in a mortar, working with small amounts at a time. The white sediment which results is collected on a Büchner funnel and dissolved immediately in about 300 cc. of warm benzene (40–50°). The benzene solution is separated from the small aqueous layer, dried over calcium chloride for eight hours, and filtered. The benzene is distilled under reduced pressure by heating in a water bath at 30–40°. The crystalline residue is extracted in a Soxhlet apparatus with petroleum ether (b.p. 20–40°) until the residue in the thimble consists of practically pure phthalic anhydride. The petroleum ether is distilled from the extract, and the crude unsymmetrical phthalyl chloride is purified by fractional crystallization from petroleum ether (b.p. 20–50°). The purified chloride melts at 87–89°. The melting point is not sharp because the unsymmetrical compound begins to revert to the symmetrical isomer. The yield of pure unsymmetrical phthalyl chloride is about 76 g. (72 per cent of the theoretical amount) and is dependent on the quality of the aluminum chloride used.
B. Hexacarbonyl(1-methyl-2-propynylium)dicobalt tetrafluoroborate (1). A 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a stopper, and a gas inlet T-tube that is attached to a mineral oil bubbler is flame-dried under a flow of nitrogen. The flask is charged with 200 mL of dry dichloromethane and 13.0 g (0.185 mol) of 3-butyn-2-ol. After the mixture is stirred for 15 min, 65.0 g (0.19 mol) of dicobalt octacarbonyl is added in portions over a few minutes while maintaining a slow stream of nitrogen. Vigorous gas evolution (carbon monoxide!) is observed. The mixture is stirred for 4–5 hr, and the solvent is then removed under reduced pressure (20–25 mm). The residual solid (alkyne)Co2(CO6) complex is dissolved in 40 mL of propionic anhydride under nitrogen and cooled to −45°C in a dry ice–acetonitrile bath. Tetrafluoroboric acid–dimethyl etherate (37.3 g, 0.28 mol) is added with stirring. After 30 min, 600–800 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether is added with continuous stirring. The burgundy-red salt that precipitates is isolated by filtration under a flow of nitrogen and is thoroughly washed with anhydrous diethyl ether to give 60–61 g (76–77%) of hexacarbonyl(1-methyl-2-propynylium)dicobalt tetrafluoroborate. This material is used immediately in the following step.
A. (S)-(-)-1,3-Diphenyl-2-propyn-1-ol (3). A flame-dried, 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a glass stopper, argon inlet adapter, and teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with (S)-BINOL (0.230 g, 0.80 mmol) and then is transferred to a glove box and charged with InBr3 (0.291 g, 0.80 mmol). The flask is removed from the glove box and equipped with a rubber septum and a flame-dried reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet adapter. Dichloromethane (4.0 mL) and then benzaldehyde (4.1 mL, 40 mmol) are added via syringe at room temperature. The resulting solution is stirred at 20–25 °C for 15 min, after which dicyclohexylmethylamine (0.86 mL, 4.0 mmol) is added by syringe. After 10 min, phenylacetylene (8.8 mL, 80 mmol) is added in one portion by syringe and the resulting yellow solution is stirred at 40 °C (oil bath temperature) for 48 h. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature, then is poured into a 200-mL separatory funnel, and is washed with 50 mL of aqueous 1 M HCl solution. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 50-mL portions of dichloromethane, and the combined organic layers are dried over Na2SO4 (2 g), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (room temperature, 20 mmHg) to afford 13.1 g of a yellow oil. This material is purified by silica gel column chromatography (elution with ethyl acetate/hexanes) to furnish 6.10–6.45 g (73-77%) of 3 as a pale yellow solid. The enantiomeric excess is determined to be 98% by CSP-HPLC.
A solution of 100 g. of sodium bisulfite in 200 ml. of water is added as stirring is continued. After a few minutes a thick precipitate separates. The mixture is stirred or preferably shaken mechanically at room temperature with exclusion of air for 10 hours. The bisulfite addition product is separated by suction filtration, washed with ether until colorless, and decomposed in a flask with a lukewarm solution of 125 g. of sodium carbonate in 150 ml. of water. The ketone layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with four 25-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Most of the ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residual oil is distilled at reduced pressure.
The crude product weighs somewhat more than 70 g. and contains water and sodium chloride. It is dissolved in 500 ml. of boiling benzene, the solution is filtered by gravity, and the solid in the flask and funnel is rinsed with 50 ml. of boiling benzene. The filtrate is concentrated by distillation until no more water collects in the distillate, and the residual solution (300–400 ml.) is cooled. The atrolactic acid which crystallizes is collected on a suction filter and washed with 25 ml. of cold benzene and 25 ml. of commercial pentane (b.p. 30–40°). After air-drying, the cream-colored product amounts to 42.9–43.5 g., m.p. 88–90° with shrinking at 82° and. It is pure enough for most purposes but is intermediate in composition between the anhydrous acid and hemihydrate and contains about 3% sodium chloride. This product is dissolved in 200 ml. of boiling water and treated with 10 g. of Norit. The solution is filtered and cooled overnight at 0–5°. The pure, colorless crystals of atrolactic acid hemihydrate that separate are collected on a suction filter and air-dried. The yield is 33.5–34.7 g. (29–30%), m.p. 88–90° with softening beginning at 75°. The anhydrous acid can be obtained by drying the hemihydrate at 55°/1–2 mm.; m.p. 94.5–95°.
A. (−)-(3-Oxocamphorylsulfonyl)imine. A 2-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a condenser and magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 42.6 g (0.2 mol) of (−)-(camphorylsulfonyl)imine, 30.0 g (0.27 mol) of selenium dioxide, and 500 mL of reagent grade acetic acid. The mixture is stirred at reflux for 14 hr, and the black selenium metal that separates is removed by suction filtration of the hot reaction mixture using a 250-mL porcelain filter funnel. The funnel, flask and residue are washed with 50 mL of acetic acid. Removal of solvent using a rotary evaporator gives 43.0–47.0 g of crude (−)-(3-oxocamphorylsulfonyl)imine as a dark orange solid that is dried under reduced pressure overnight in a desiccator and. This product is suitable for further reaction without purification.
This product can be further purified by stirring it for several minutes with 200 ml. of benzene at 45°. The insoluble portion is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed first with 40 ml. of cold benzene and then with 40 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 28–38°). There is thus obtained 30–34 g. (71–81%) of almost colorless 9-fluorenecarboxylic acid melting at 219–222° with some previous sintering.
A normal solution of sodium hypochlorite is prepared as follows: in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 1800 g. of sodium hydroxide solution [300 g. (7.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide to 1500 g. of water] and 1500 g. of ice. Chlorine gas is then passed into the solution until it has gained in weight approximately 213 g. (3 moles). During this addition, the solution must be kept thoroughly cooled with ice, in order that chlorates will not be formed. After all the chlorine has been passed in, it is necessary to be certain that the mixture is slightly alkaline, since any free chlorine in the solution prevents the formation of hydrazine.
After the quench is complete, the mixture is diluted with 2 L of ether and washed in a separatory funnel with 1.25 L of aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is reextracted with a 2-L portion of ether. The combined ethereal layers are washed with 1.25 L of saturated brine solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and removal of solvent using a rotary evaporator there remains 26 g of crude product as a reddish-brown oil. Distillation of this material under reduced pressure through an unpacked, 2-inch distillation apparatus affords 17.3 g (81%) of ethyl 1-naphthylacetate as a yellow liquid, (bp 134–138°C, 0.2 mm),.
The stirrer is then again started and about 500 cc. of water is slowly added. External cooling is used in order that the water may be added more rapidly. The excess carbon tetrachloride usually refluxes during this part of the procedure. The reaction mixture is then first heated on a steam bath to remove most of the excess of carbon tetrachloride, then the mixture is distilled with steam to carry over the remaining carbon tetrachloride, and to hydrolyze the benzophenone dichloride to benzophenone. The carbon tetrachloride comes over in about thirty minutes but the steam distillation is continued for about one hour to insure complete hydrolysis. The upper benzophenone layer is then separated from the aqueous layer and the latter is extracted with about 200 cc. of benzene. The benzene solution and the benzophenone are transferred to a 1-l. modified Claisen flask (p. 130) for distillation. The benzene and any water that is present are removed under ordinary pressure and the benzophenone is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield is 490–550 g. (80–89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the benzene) of a product boiling at 187–190° /15 mm., and solidifying to a white solid melting at 47–48°. The material sometimes has a bluish tinge. This color may be removed and a colorless product obtained by moistening the material with benzene and centrifuging.
C. Dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3). Under an atmosphere of argon in a flame-dried, 250-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 2 (34.1 g crude product) is dissolved in THF (150 mL). Under an atmosphere of argon in a second flame-dried, 500-mL, single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, potassium tert-butoxide (41.6 g, 371 mmol, 4 equiv, assuming 100% purity of 2) is dissolved in THF (100 mL). The resulting cloudy solution is then cooled with an ice bath. At 0 °C the solution of 2 is transferred through a teflon tube (1.5 mm internal diameter) over a period of 15 min into the 500-mL flask. During the period of addition the color changes from orange to brown and finally to black. Then the ice bath is removed, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 2 h until TLC-analysis indicates complete consumption of the dibromide 2. Distilled water (15 mL) is added and the black mixture is poured onto a pad of silica gel (diameter 10 cm x 4 cm height) that has already been wetted with diethyl ether. The pad is rinsed with 700 mL of diethyl ether, and the eluent is collected directly as a single fraction, dried over Na2SO4 (40 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675 to 75 mmHg) and then at 15 mmHg for 1 h. The crude product remains as a brown solid (18.5 g), which is scraped off the inner wall of the flask and dried overnight under vacuum (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Purification by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-145 °C, 0.2 mmHg) affords 13.0 g (69%, two steps from 1) of dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene (3) as colorless plates.
A. α-Bromophenylacetic acid. A 3-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser is charged with 750 ml. of benzene, 230 g. (1.69 moles) of phenylacetic acid, 15 g. (0.12 mole) of phosphorus trichloride and 288 g. (1.80 moles) of bromine. The resulting solution is heated at gentle reflux for 2–3 days until the initial bromine color is discharged. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and after 1 hour is decanted from some polymeric material into a 2-l. distilling flask. Removal of the solvent by distillation at water bath temperatures with the aid of a water aspirator gives a black oil which is poured into 250–300 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90–120°). The mixture is heated, dissolving the oil, and the solution is stored at −25° in a freezer for 12 hours. Filtration on a sintered-glass funnel followed by washing with 200 ml. of cold (10°) ligroin (b.p. 90–120°) gives 243 g. (67%) of α-bromophenylacetic acid as a white solid, m.p. 73–83°. Recrystallization from about 400 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 90–120°) with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon affords 217–233 g. (60–62%) of the purified acid, m.p. 80.5–84°.
Before the final assembling of the apparatus, the flasks are charged as follows: One kilo of freshly fused and finely powdered acid potassium sulfate, 200 g. of powdered potassium sulfate, and 300 g. (238 cc.) of dry glycerol are thoroughly mixed in each of flasks B and D. In each of flasks I and M is placed about 1 g. of hydroquinone to act as a stabilizer for the acrolein.1
W-6 Raney nickel catalyst. In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a thermometer and a stainless-steel stirrer are placed 600 ml. of distilled water and 160 g. of c.p. sodium hydroxide pellets. The solution is stirred rapidly and allowed to cool to 50° in an ice bath equipped with an overflow siphon. Then 125 g. of Raney nickel-aluminum alloy powder is added in small portions during a period of 25–30 minutes. The temperature is maintained at 50 ± 2° by controlling the rate of addition of the alloy to the sodium hydroxide solution and the addition of ice to the cooling bath. When all the alloy has been added, the suspension is digested at 50 ± 2° for 50 minutes with gentle stirring. It is usually necessary to remove the ice bath and replace it with a hot-water bath to keep the temperature constant. After this period of digestion the catalyst is washed with three 1-l. portions of distilled water by decantation.
D. 2,7-Dimethyloxepin. In a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted as above, except that the dropping funnel is replaced by a 125-ml. Erlenmeyer flask connected to the reaction flask by means of Gooch tubing, is placed a solution of 42.1 g. (0.15 mole) of the purified dibromoepoxide in 500 ml. of anhydrous ether. The solution is cooled to 0° and 33.2 g. (0.30 mole) of potassium t-butoxide is added portionwise through the Gooch tubing over a period of 1 hour while maintaining the temperature below 5°. The resulting mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and filtered. The ether is removed under reduced pressure, and the residual liquid is distilled to give 9.7–12.2 g. (52–67%) of 2,7-dimethyloxepin as an orange oil, b.p. 49–50° (15 mm). n27D 1.5010.
A 2-l. three-necked flask is mounted on a steam bath and fitted with a reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and an efficient sealed stirrer. In the flask is placed 600 ml. of absolute ethanol, and to this is added gradually 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of clean sodium cut into small pieces. The sodium ethoxide solution is stirred and cooled to room temperature, after which 267 g. (260 ml., 2.05 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate is added slowly through the separatory funnel. The reflux condenser is then replaced by a short still head, and the ethanol is removed by distillation at approximately room temperature and under the pressure of a water pump. When approximately half the ethanol has been removed, sufficient sodium enolate precipitates so that stirring has to be discontinued. When the residue appears dry (after about 2 hours) the last traces of ethanol are removed by heating for an hour on the steam bath under a pressure of 2 mm. The flask is allowed to cool to room temperature under reduced pressure.
A. Dibenzofuran-4,6-dicarboxylic acid(2).2 A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a large magnetic stirbar. Under argon, the flask is charged with 350 mL of dry, freshly distilled diethyl ether, 10.0 g (59.4 mmol) of dibenzofuran and 27 mL (179 mmol) of tetramethylethylenediamine (TMEDA). The mixture is cooled to −78°C (bath temperature) with a dry ice/acetone bath, and stirred while 137 mL (178 mmol) of sec-butyllithium is added over 1 hr via cannula and syringe. After warming the reaction mixture to 25°C, the suspension is stirred for 24 hr. The mixture is cooled again to −78°C under vigorous stirring and gaseous carbon dioxide (CO2) is introduced over 1 hr; the reaction mixture is then warmed to 25°C over 4 hr under a constant CO2 stream. After decanting the supernatant liquid, a brown solid is isolated by filtration using a Buchner funnel. The residue is washed with 300 mL of diethyl ether and then suspended in 200 mL water, acidified with aqueous 2N HCl to pH 3, and stirred for 1 hr. After filtration, the beige solids are washed first with 400 mL of water and then with 200 mL of diethyl ether. The solids are dried under vacuum over phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) for three days to yield 14.5 g (96%) of the title compound 2.
B. 3-Methoxy-17-trimethylsiloxy-1,3,5(10), 16-estratetraene. A 125-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer is purged with argon and charged with 6.8 g (0.024 mol) of estrone 3-methyl ether, 50 mL of dry benzene, and 4.0 mL (2.9 g, 0.029 mol) of triethylamine. The solution is stirred, 4.9 mL (5.6 g, 0.025 mol) of trimethylsilyl triflate is added through a syringe, and the mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hr. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, whereupon it separates into two layers. Dry hexane (40 mL) is added, and the upper hexane–benzene layer is separated, washed successively with saturated sodium bicarbonate and water, and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is transferred to a 125-mL, round-bottomed, tared flask. The solution is evaporated to a constant weight with a rotary evaporator, initially at water-aspirator pressure and then at 0.5–1 mm, to leave 8.6 g (100%) of pale-yellow enol trimethylsilyl ether. This material is used immediately in Part C without purification.
To a mixture of 138.1 g. (1 mole) of salicyclic acid and 128.6 g. (1 mole) of p-chlorophenol in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask and a reflux condenser with a drying tube is added 58.3 g. (0.38 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride. The mixture is heated with occasional swirling, and the temperature is maintained at 75–80°. At the end of 4 hours the reactants have been reduced to a molten mass, and this is poured slowly, with vigorous stirring, into a solution of 120 g. of sodium carbonate in 800 ml. of water. The precipitated ester is collected on a filter and washed with four 200-ml. portions of water. The yield of crude, air-dried, p-chlorophenyl salicylate is 174–189 g. (70–76%); m.p. 65–66°. Recrystallization from absolute ethanol yields 136–154 g. (55–62%) of pure product; m.p. 69.5–70.5°. A second crop may be obtained by concentration of the filtrate from the first crop or by the addition of water.
The crude DL-aspartic acid, amounting to 58–60 g., is recrystallized from 600 ml. of hot water and yields 54 g. of pure DL-aspartic acid. The mother liquors on evaporation to about 90 ml. yield an additional 2–3 g.. The total yield of pure colorless DL-aspartic acid is 56–57 g. (42–43%).
Workup. Method B [with recovery of (R,R)-(+)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyltartaric acid diamide]. The mixture is quenched with aqueous saturated ammonium chloride (80 mL), and the resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 5 min. The two clear layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with dichloromethane (20 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual oil is dissolved in ether (75 mL) and water (50 mL). The resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 1 hr. The layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with ether (20 mL). This aqueous layer is kept for tetramethyltartaric acid diamide recovery (see below). The combined organic layers are treated with 60 mL of aqueous 2 N sodium hydroxide and 10 mL of aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide. The resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 5 min. The two layers are separated and the organic layer is washed successively with aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (50 mL), saturated aqueous sodium sulfite (50 mL), saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (50 mL), and brine (50 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is left under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) overnight (12-16 hr) to remove butanol produced in this oxidative work-up. The product is purified by a Kugelrohr distillation (90°C, 0.8 mm) to afford 1.02 g (93%) of (2S,3S)-(+)-(3-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol as a colorless oil.
C. Methyl dl-anti-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate. Freshly distilled methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenepentanoate (14.4 g, 0.1 mol) is added to the biphosphinorhodium catalyst (catalyst/substrate ratio 1/250) in the flask from Step A. Methanol [40 mL, distilled from Mg(OMe)2] is added. The apparatus is sealed with a rubber septum, the side arm is connected to a burette line, and the apparatus is then transferred to a dry ice/2-propanol bath. The vessel is evacuated to 1 mm 3 times and filled with hydrogen each time, the burette being partially filled on the last occasion. The mixture is warmed to near-ambient temperature and transferred to a water bath at 12° ± 2°C. When thermal equilibration is complete, the stirrer is started so as to create a deep vortex in the reaction solution, which darkens to a brick-red color with rapid uptake of hydrogen. The burette is recharged with hydrogen as necessary, and gas absorption occurs steadily until the reaction is complete, when ca. 2.5 L of hydrogen has been consumed. Completion of reaction can be readily checked by addition of 50 μL of methyl 3-hydroxy-2-methylenepentanoate to the reaction solution by microsyringe, leading to a perceptible burst of gas absorption. At this stage the flask is disconnected from the hydrogen line and flushed with argon and the contents are transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask. Solvent is removed at ambient temperature on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is dissolved in diethyl ether (40 mL) and 30–40 petroleum ether (150 mL). The mixture is filtered through a small plug of silica (60 μm, Merck flash chromatography grade) that effectively retains the residual rhodium catalyst. Solvents are removed on a rotary evaporator, and the colorless product is distilled in a Kugelrohr apparatus, bp 50°C (~ 0.5 mm). The yield of methyl dl-anti-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate is 13.3 g (91%), chemically and stereochemically pure by 13C NMR.
The 195–260° fractions of the distillates are treated with potassium carbonate to salt out the allyl alcohol and to neutralize the little formic acid present. This allyl alcohol is then distilled and the fraction boiling up to about 103° is collected, or if a column is used, up to 98°. In this way, 845 g. of an allyl alcohol is obtained, which by bromine titration shows a purity of about 68–70 per cent. This is equivalent to 570–590 g. of pure allyl alcohol (45–47 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Freshly distilled cis-cyclooctene, 178 g. (214 ml., 1.62 moles) and 200 ml. of sodium-dried pentane are introduced to the flask, and the dropping funnel is charged with 420 g. (148 ml., 1.66 moles) of bromoform. The bromoform is added dropwise to the stirred slurry over a period of 6–7 hours, the color of the reaction mixture changing gradually from light yellow to brown. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and left stirring overnight. Water (400 ml.) is added to the reaction mixture followed by enough 10% aqueous hydrochloric acid to neutralize the slightly basic solution. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined pentane solutions are washed with three 50-ml. portions of water. The pentane solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and stripped of solvent on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue yields 237–299 g. (52–65%) of 9,9-dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane, b.p. 62° (0.04 mm.), n23D 1.5493–1.5507.
The product is distilled under reduced pressure. Below 114°/14 mm., 220–250 g. distil; this portion is mostly water. The monochlorohydrin is collected between 114° and 120°/14 mm., and weighs 360 g. (66 per cent of the theoretical amount). About 20 g. more may be obtained by neutralizing the first fraction and separating the aqueous layer.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped for mechanical stirring, and outfitted with a 250-mL, pressure equalizing addition funnel, and a Claisen adapter bearing a thermometer and a nitrogen inlet/outlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere and charged with 41.5 g (0.167 mol) of titanocene dichloride, and 450 mL of dry toluene. The slurry is efficiently stirred and chilled to an internal temperature of −5°C in a ice/methanol bath; then 126 mL of a 3 M solution (0.38 mol) of methylmagnesium chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 1 hr, at a rate of addition adjusted to maintain an internal temperature below +8°C. The resulting orange slurry is mechanically stirred at an internal temperature of 0 to +5°C for 1 hr, or until the insoluble purple titanocene dichloride is no longer seen in the suspension. The addition funnel is removed and replaced by a rubber septum, and the reaction is assayed by 1H NMR.
A 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel. The condenser is connected in series with two traps, immersed in liquid nitrogen, with the exit leading to a drying tube. A line for dry nitrogen that has a T-tube joined to a U-tube containing mercury is connected to the top of the addition funnel. To the flask are added 150 ml. of purified dioxane and 13.6 g. (0.591 g.-atom) of freshly cut sodium. The mixture is heated to reflux, and the molten sodium is broken up with the stirrer. A solution of 20.0 g. (0.118 mole) of 1-bromo-3-chlorocyclobutane in 20 ml. of dioxane is added to the refluxing dioxane over a 1-hour period; refluxing is maintained for an additional 2 hours and. The product in the traps is separated from any dioxane with the vacuum manifold system shown in Figure 1. The two traps containing the product are cooled in liquid nitrogen and connected to one of the stopcocks on the manifold. A gas storage bulb is attached to the other stopcock. All the stopcocks are opened, and the system is evacuated. The stopcock to the pump is then closed, and the liquid nitrogen bath is removed from the traps and used to cool the gas storage bulb. The traps are warmed slightly, and the bicyclobutane condenses in the storage bulb, leaving the dioxane behind, yielding 5–6 g. (78–94%) of bicyclobutane.
The flask is cooled by immersion in a slush of ice and water, and the addition compound is decomposed by adding gradually 200 g. of ice, 100 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (this is best done under a hood). The keto acid separates in the form of a stiff, grayish white paste. The solvent is removed by steam distillation, in which operation it is advisable to use a very rapid flow of steam together with an efficient condensing system, such as that illustrated (Fig. 1). The condensing flask shown need be no more than 1 l. in capacity, and the exit tube should be centered at the bottom of this flask so that it can drain the contents completely. Some condensate ordinarily remains in the flask to serve as a vapor seal, a factor which adds greatly to the efficiency of condensation. For purposes of inspection, the flask can be emptied by diverting for a moment the stream of water to one side of the flask. The stoppers which are under pressure should be secured with wire. The distilling flask is heated to prevent too much condensation of steam.
D. tert-Butylamine. To 150 ml. of cold 40% solution of sodium hydroxide is added 109.5 g. (1 mole) of tert-butylamine hydrochloride with stirring. The solution is saturated with potassium carbonate (about 100–150 g.); the layer of amine is separated and dried over 20 g. of sodium hydroxide pellets. The product is distilled using an ice-cooled receiver, and the fraction boiling at 44–46° is collected. If the purified amine hydrochloride is the starting material for this step the yield ranges from 65 g. to 69 g. (89–94%). When the crude amine salt is employed, the yield is 46–60 g. (64–83%).
The aqueous layer separated from the main carbon tetrachloride solution is shaken with 100 cc. of carbon tetrachloride, and thus yields about 10 g. of pure acid; when the dilute and the concentrated hydrobromic acid fractions are extracted in the same way, about 5 g. and 15 g. respectively of β-bromopropionic acid are obtained. The total yield is 560–570 g. (82–83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Deionized water (400 mL) is added to the flask and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 30 min. Using a 2-L separatory funnel, the dichloromethane phase is separated from the aqueous phase, which is discarded. The organic phase is then washed with 350 mL of deionized water and with 200 mL of 50% v/v water/saturated brine solution. The dichloromethane phase is dried with 10 g of MgSO4, then filtered through a sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation (water aspirator) using a bath temperature of ca. 40°C.
C. Cycloheptane-1,3-dione. A three-necked, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal temperature probe, 50-mL addition funnel with nitrogen inlet, a septum with nitrogen outlet and magnetic stir bar is purged with nitrogen and charged with 1-trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]-heptan-6-one (17.1 g, 81.0 mmol) and 33 mL each of 2-propanol and water. The solution is cooled to an internal temperature of 0-5 °C with an ice-water bath, and 26 mL of 2:1 water-acetic acid (v/v) is added dropwise via the addition funnel over 30 min. At this rate of addition, the internal temperature remains below 5 °C throughout the addition. The solution is then allowed to stir for 16 h and gradually come to room temperature. A 60-μL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 μL of ether from which a 4-μL sample is used for GC analysis, which shows complete conversion to cycloheptane-1,3-dione. The reaction mixture is poured into 200 mL of MTBE in a 500-mL separatory funnel. The layers are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with an additional 100 mL of MTBE. The organic solutions are combined, washed with 50 mL of brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. Filtration through cotton, rinsing with 50 mL MTBE and concentration on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 °C water bath) provides the crude product as a clear, amber oil. 1H NMR analysis shows the diketone contaminated with residual MTBE and acetic acid. The oil is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, and treated with 22.5 g of silica gel. Concentration on the rotary evaporator provides a tan, free-flowing solid, which is placed on the top of a 7.5 × 23 cm column of silica gel packed as a slurry in hexane/Et2O, 2:1. The column is eluted with hexane/Et2O, 2:1 (500 mL) and 1:1 (3.8 L), followed by combination of the product-containing fractions (TLC in hexane/Et2O, 1:1, visualization with p-anisaldehyde stain). The combined fractions are concentrated via rotary evaporator, under vacuum (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide cycloheptane-1,3-dione as a clear, pale-yellow oil (6.69 g, 53.1 mmol, 61% yield). This material is approximately 95% pure as determined by 1H NMR analysis and is suitable for most subsequent uses, although the chromatographed material fails combustion analysis. If necessary, further purification can be achieved by short path vacuum distillation.
A. N-(2-Phenylethyl)benzamide. To a solution of 12.1 g. (0.10 mole) of 2-phenylethylamine and 7.9 g. (0.10 mole) of pyridine in a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath is added, slowly with stirring, 15.5 g. (0.11 mole) of benzoyl chloride. The resulting crystalline mixture is extracted with chloroform and the chloroform solution washed with water, 5% hydrochloric acid, 5% sodium hydroxide, water, and dried. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure to yield 20–22 g. (89–98%) of the crude amide, m.p. 100–110°, which is of sufficient purity for use in the next step. If desired, however, the crude product may be recrystallized from 95% ethanol, m.p. 115–116°.
In a 500-cc. three-necked, round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer is placed 106 g. (1 mole) of benzaldehyde, and 93 g. (1 mole) of aniline is added with rapid stirring. After a few seconds a reaction occurs with evolution of heat and separation of water. The mixture is allowed to stand fifteen minutes and is then poured, with vigorous stirring, into 165 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol in a 600-cc. beaker. Crystallization begins in about five minutes, and the mixture is allowed to stand, first ten minutes at room temperature, and then thirty minutes in ice water. The almost solid mass is next transferred to a large Büchner funnel, filtered by suction, pressed out, and air-dried. The yield of pure benzalaniline melting at 52° is 152–158 g. (84–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The product is a dark-colored solution which is poured slowly into sulfuric acid (100 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 100 ml. of water) with cooling. This operation should be conducted in a hood because some hydrogen cyanide may be evolved from unreacted sodium cyanide. The mixture is then extracted four times with 100-ml. portions of ether. The first 100 ml. of ether yields about 260 ml. of organic material, and succeeding portions about 95 ml. each. The extract is dried over about 20 g. of magnesium sulfate and distilled. After removal of low-boiling materials, there is obtained 124–128 g. (76–79%) of crude 3-chloro-2,2,3-trifluoropropionic acid, b.p. 70–85°/30 mm.; the bulk of this fraction distills at 83°/30 mm., nD25 1.3708–1.3717. This product is of sufficient purity for most purposes. About 25–30 g. of high-boiling residue remains which is chiefly chlorotrifluoropropionamide.
(A) Ethyl Sodium Phthalimidomalonate.—To a solution of 9.2 g. (0.4 gram atom) of sodium in 300 cc. of absolute alcohol at 60° is added, with efficient stirring, 126 g. (0.41 mole) of ethyl phthalimidomalonate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 271). The mixture is rapidly chilled to 0°; the crystalline product is filtered at once by suction and washed successively with two 200-cc. portions of absolute alcohol and two 200-cc. portions of ether. After first drying in a vacuum desiccator and then heating for eight hours under 15 mm. pressure in a flask suspended in an oil bath at 145–155°, the product weighs 108–111 g. (82–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 2-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a separatory funnel, are placed a cool solution of 240 cc. (4.3 moles) of commercial sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in 240 cc. of water, and 240 g. (296 cc., 3.24 moles) of technical n-butyl alcohol. The whole is placed in a large, efficient ice-salt bath.
In a copper or iron kettle of 4-l. capacity is placed a solution of 200 g. (1.33 moles) of d-tartaric acid and 700 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1400 cc. of water. A 12-l. flask through which cold water is run is placed in the mouth of the kettle in order to prevent loss of water vapor, and the mixture is boiled gently over an open flame for four hours. The solution is now transferred to a 12-l. flask or crock and partially neutralized with 1400 cc. of commercial hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). To the still alkaline solution is now added just enough sodium sulfide to precipitate all the iron or copper which has been dissolved from the kettle. The filtered solution is then just acidified with hydrochloric acid, boiled to expel all hydrogen sulfide, and made very faintly alkaline to phenolphthalein with sodium hydroxide solution. To the hot solution is then added a concentrated solution of 300 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride which causes an immediate precipitation of calcium dl-tartrate and meso-tartrate.
To 450 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 500 cc. of water, in a 4-l. (1-gal.) earthenware crock equipped with an efficient stirrer, is added 143 g. (1 mole) of β-naphthylamine. The suspension of the amine hydrochloride is cooled by the addition of 500 g. of cracked ice. When the temperature reaches 5°, solid sodium nitrite (about 69 g.) is added until starch-iodide paper shows an excess. During the diazotization about 600 g. of cracked ice is introduced at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 5°. The cold solution of the diazonium salt is filtered to remove a small amount of precipitate and returned to the crock. A solution of 271 g. (1 mole) of mercuric chloride in 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is mixed with 300 g. of ice and added slowly to the rapidly stirred solution. A heavy precipitate of the yellow addition compound of β-naphthalenediazonium chloride and mercuric chloride separates. Stirring is continued for a half hour, after which the precipitate is collected on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel, sucked as dry as possible, and washed with two 400-cc. portions of water and two 150-cc. portions of acetone. The solid is air-dried at about 20° to constant weight. The yield is 380–390 g. (82–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a second nitrogen-flushed, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed reaction flask with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a two-way adapter carrying a calcium chloride tube and a rubber septum with a Teflon tube, connected to a reaction flask (1 in Fig. 1), are placed 4.4 g (31 mmol) of copper(I) bromide and 70 mL of diethyl ether. The ethereal Grignard solution from the reaction flask (1) is added, through the Teflon tube by means of nitrogen pressure (see Fig. 1), to this vigorously stirred suspension at −20°C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at −20°C for ½ hr. The rubber septum is replaced by a 100-mL, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 40.0 g (0.26 mol) of (R)-(+)-pulegone in 50 mL of diethyl ether. This solution is added with stirring at −20°C to the dark-green reaction mixture during ca. 2 hr. After the reaction mixture is kept overnight at −20°C, it is added to 300 mL of vigorously stirred ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid. The organic layer is separated and filtered with suction, and the residue on the funnel is washed twice with 20-mL portions of ether. The aqueous layer is saturated with ammonium chloride and extracted three times with 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude oily product (ca. 62.4 g) is used for equilibration without further purification.
The sodium sulfite solution is placed in a 12-l. flask and cooled to about 5°. Approximately 500 g. of cracked ice is added, and then, with mechanical stirring, the diazonium salt solution is run in as rapidly as possible. The mixture becomes a bright orangered. The flask is now warmed to about 20° on a steam bath, until the solid sodium sulfite, which has separated while cooling, redissolves. The total amount of liquid is now about 10 l. One-half of this is poured into another 12-l. flask, and both halves are warmed on the steam bath to 60–70°, until the color becomes quite dark (thirty to sixty minutes). Sufficient hydrochloric acid (300–400 cc.) is now added to each flask to make the solutions acid to litmus. The heating is continued and the color gradually becomes lighter until, after four to six hours, the solutions have become nearly colorless; they may be heated overnight, if desired.
F. 1-Octanol. The stirred solution prepared in Section E is cooled below ca. 10° with an ice bath, and a solution of 34 ml. (0.1 mole) of 3 N sodium hydroxide is introduced. This is followed by the dropwise addition of 36 ml. (0.35 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide, added at a rate such that the reaction temperature is maintained between 30–35°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture is then extracted with 100 ml. of ether. The ether extract is washed with four 100-ml. portions of water and dried over Drierite. After removal of solvent on a rotary evaporator, the residue is distilled through a 3-cm. Vigreux column, giving, as a forerun, 9.6–10.5 g. of 3-methyl-2-butanol, b.p. 110–115°, followed by 8.5–9.1 g. (65–70%) of 1-octanol, b.p. 182–186°.
To the diazotized solution is added 35 g. (0.55 atom) of copper bronze which has been washed with ether. The stirrer is replaced by a long, efficient reflux condenser. A bath of ice water is prepared for cooling the flask when the reaction becomes too vigorous. The flask is warmed cautiously until a vigorous evolution of gas starts. It is then immersed in the ice water to prevent loss through the condenser by too rapid evolution of nitrogen and acetaldehyde. When the reaction has moderated, the flask is again warmed, and finally the mixture is heated for ten minutes on a steam bath. At the end of the reaction the color changes from reddish brown to yellow.
In a 2-l. flask are placed 512 g. (4 moles) of naphthalene and 275 g. (170 cc.) of carbon tetrachloride. The flask is equipped with a stirrer, an efficient reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, the stem of which extends below the level of the liquid. From the top of the reflux condenser a tube leads to a water trap similar to that described in Fig. 7 on p. 97. The mixture is warmed on a steam bath to gentle boiling, and 707 g. (220 cc., 4.4 moles) of bromine is run in at such a rate that practically none of it is carried over with the hydrogen bromide into the trap. This requires from twelve to fifteen hours, during which time the mixture is gently warmed on the steam bath, with continual stirring, until the evolution of hydrogen bromide ceases (about six hours). The mixture is now distilled from the steam bath under slightly reduced pressure (using a condenser) until free of carbon tetrachloride; the residue is mixed with 20–30 g. of powdered or granulated sodium hydroxide and stirred at 90–100° for four hours. The liquid is transferred to a flask for fractional distillation and distilled under reduced pressure. The forerun contains a considerable proportion of unchanged naphthalene, the bulk of which is removed by chilling and filtering with suction; the main fraction, consisting of bromonaphthalene, passes over at 132–135°/12 mm. (145–148°/20 mm.), and a high-boiling fraction, consisting of dibromonaphthalene, is collected. The intermediate fractions and the filtrates from the foreruns are systematically redistilled; in this way 600–620 g. of colorless α-bromonaphthalene (72–75 per cent of the theoretical amount) and about 30 g. of a mixture of dibromonaphthalenes (m.p., about 60°) are obtained.
E. N-(3,3-Dimethoxy-1-trifluoromethyl-propyl)-acetamide (5). A flame-dried, 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a large magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper and a reflux condenser connected to the argon line. The flask is charged with the crude radical adduct 4 (17.8 g), MeOH (100 mL) and (±)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (12.5 mol%, 1.37 g, 5.9 mmol). The mixture is refluxed in an oil bath for 24 h before it is cooled to ambient temperature. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (80 mL) and the organic phase is washed successively with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (20 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium chloride (20 mL). The organic solvent is dried over MgSO4, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting brown syrup (11.8 g) is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel using hexanes/ethyl acetate (2:3) as the eluent to give N-(3,3-dimethoxy-1-trifluoromethyl-propyl)-acetamide (5) as colorless crystals (4.43 g, 41%).
B. p-Chlorobenzoic anhydride (benzoic anhydride, p,p'-dichloro-). A mixture of 17.5 g. (0.1 mole) of p-chlorobenzoyl chloride and 50 ml. (0.6 mole) of pyridine in a loosely stoppered 200-ml. flask is warmed on the steam bath for 5 minutes and poured upon 100 g. of cracked ice and 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The anhydride separates at once; as soon as the ice has melted sufficiently the mixture is filtered by suction. The solid is washed once with 15 ml. of methanol, then with 15 ml. of dry benzene. The yield is 14.2–14.6 g. (96–98%). Though suitable for most purposes, the crude product can be purified by recrystallization from 250 ml. of dry benzene; the recovery is 90%; it melts at 192–193°.
The crude chlorinated mixture is steam-distilled in this special apparatus to obtain thiocarbonyl perchloride and to decompose the sulfur chloride. In flask A is placed 1210 cc. of water which is heated to boiling by means of the ring burner. Steam is passed in through tubes B and C. The chlorinated mixture is placed in the separatory funnel H, and the connecting tubes are filled with the liquid which is allowed to pass into A at about 5 drops per second. Sulfur begins to separate in the column and in the condensers. The steam distillation requires about five hours and gives 10–12 l. of distillate consisting of water, sulfur, and a heavy red oil. The water is decanted and the rest of the mixture is filtered by suction through glass wool. The oil is separated and dried over about 10 g. of calcium chloride.
The product is pure enough for most uses. If a purer product is desired, the crystals may be dissolved in the minimum amount of boiling water and treated with Norit. The resulting solution is filtered and added to a large excess of 95% ethanol and stirred vigorously for several hours. The product is collected after 4–6 hours. An appreciable amount of the β-form of the amino sugar remains dissolved in the alcohol and may be precipitated by adding ether.
C. 2α-Benzyloxy-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one (4) A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask capped with a rubber septum and equipped with a nitrogen balloon and magnetic stirring bar is charged under nitrogen atmosphere with silyl enol ether 3 (9.2 g, 24 mmol) and dichloromethane (25 mL). The mixture is cooled to −78 °C, and furan (1.8 mL, 24 mmol) is added by syringe. After 15 min at −78 °C, TMSOTf (0.46 mL, 2.4 mmol) is added by syringe. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at −78 °C and then a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate (25 mL) is added. The cooling bath is removed and the flask is shaken thoroughly until the mixture reaches room temperature. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 25 mL) and the combined organic phase is dried (Na2SO4). After removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product is purified by column chromatography (5-cm diameter column, 250 g silica gel, MTBE/cyclohexane (1:3)) giving cycloadduct 4 as a colorless oil (3.72 g, 70%). On storage in the freezer at −25 °C, the product crystallizes from tert-butyl methyl ether to give a white solid (2.87 g, 54%) mp 64–65 °C.
The reaction mixture is now transferred to a Claisen flask connected with a water-cooled condenser, and the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at ordinary pressure by raising the temperature of the oil bath gradually to 200–220°. The water condenser is then replaced by a short air-cooled condenser, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. A small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride first distils over, after which the receiver is changed and the temperature rises rapidly to the boiling point of p-nitrobenzoyl chloride, 197°/73 mm. (155°/20 mm.). During this distillation the oil bath should be kept at a temperature of about 230–250° (or at 210–215° if 20 mm. pressure is used). The yield is 500–534 g. (90–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). The distillate solidifies to a yellow crystalline mass melting at 71°. The product may be recrystallized from ligroin or carbon tetrachloride, from which it separates in fine yellow needles melting at 73°.
A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and charged with 100 g of the foregoing crude lactone acid. The flask is fitted with a Claisen distillation apparatus and connected to a vacuum pump and. The flask is gradually heated with an oil bath (160°C) until gas evolution ceases. At this point the oil bath is removed and the black, viscous oil is distilled with the use of a flame. The product, 58 g (70%), is collected as a colorless oil at 146–154°C (0.03 mm). The distillate crystallizes in the receiver, mp 66–68°C and.
D. 4a(S),8a(R)-2-Benzoyloctahydro-6(2H)-isoquinolinone (4). Palladium (Pd), 10% on carbon, 4.0 g , is placed in a 500-mL Parr bottle under N2 and carefully wetted with 50 mL of cold denatured ethanol (EtOH). A slurry of 34.7 g of enone 3 (0.14 mol) in denatured EtOH (250 mL) is added and the Parr shaker apparatus assembled. After the system is purged with nitrogen-hydrogen (N2/H2), the reaction is shaken at 50 psi H2 and 50°C until H2 uptake is complete (1 hr,). The catalyst is filtered over a Celite pad and rinsed with warm chloroform (CHCl3) (4 × 75 mL). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure, dissolved in 90 mL of CH2Cl2 and crystallized with 200 mL of hexanes. The crystalline solid is filtered, rinsed with hexanes and dried to afford 34.3 g (98%,) of the ketone 4, representing a 51% yield over four steps.
B. Cyclohexylmethyl N-hydroxycarbamate (4). A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet is flame-dried and maintained under nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is quickly opened to add 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole (17.0 g, 105 mmol, 1.05 equiv) followed by acetonitrile (200 mL) via cannula. The white suspension is cooled with an ice bath and cyclohexanemethanol (3) (12.3 mL, 100 mmol) is transferred to the addition funnel using a syringe. Cyclohexanemethanol (3) is added dropwise over a 30-minute time period. Addition of the alcohol results in the suspension becoming a homogeneous solution. The addition funnel is rinsed with acetonitrile (10 mL) and the solution is stirred in the ice bath for 1 h. The reaction of cyclohexanemethanol 3 (Rf = 0.63 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) with 1,1'-carbonyldiimidazole to give a carbonylated intermediate (Rf = 0.59 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) can be followed by TLC analysis using a potassium permanganate solution for visualization. Continued stirring does not improve the conversion as the intermediate can be hydrolyzed and the starting alcohol recovered. The solution is then warmed to ambient temperature. To the solution is then added hydroxylamine hydrochloride (20.9 g, 300 mmol, 3.0 equiv) followed by imidazole (13.6 g, 200 mmol, 2.0 equiv) and vigorous stirring is continued for 3.5 h. The conversion of the intermediate (Rf = 0.59 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) to cyclohexylmethyl N-hydroxycarbamate 4 (Rf = 0.52 in 30% EtOAc/DCM) can be followed by TLC analysis using a potassium permanganate solution for visualization. The suspension is concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (130 mmHg) and at 0.5 mmHg. The white residue is dissolved in a 1:1 mixture of ethyl acetate and 10% hydrochloric acid (300 mL) and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. After vigorous shaking, the phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 150 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (15 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (75 mmHg) and then at 0.5 mmHg to afford 16.57 g of a light amber oil containing the title compound 4 and residual starting alcohol 3 in a ratio of roughly 7:1, as determined by NMR analysis. This mixture is used without further purification for the next step. A 200 mg sample of the crude product is purified by silica gel chromatography to afford 167 mg (84% recovery) of the title compound as a white solid.
Two runs of 6 kg. of castor oil with the same relative proportions of alkali and water were made in 8-gallon (30-l.) cans. The yields of pure alcohol were 650 g. and 730 g. (25.8 per cent and 29 per cent, respectively, of the theoretical amount on the basis of pure ester).
A 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, a 250-cc. dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected from the air by means of a calcium chloride tube. In the flask are placed 23 g. (1 gram atom) of sodium and 250 cc. of dry toluene. The stirrer is started, and 202 g. (1 mole) of ethyl adipate (p. 264) is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the addition is complete in about two hours. The reaction usually starts immediately on addition of the ethyl adipate. The temperature of the oil bath is maintained at 100–115° during the addition and for about five hours longer. Dry toluene is added through the condenser from time to time in order to keep the reaction mixture fluid enough for efficient stirring. Between 750 cc. and 1 l. of toluene is added in this manner.
A. 2-(2,3-Dimethoxyphenyl)-4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazoline. To a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser and placed in an ice-water bath, is added 24.5 g (0.206 mol) of thionyl chloride. To this is added 12.2 g (0.067 mol) of 2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid. The resulting mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr and then at room temperature for 24 hr. Excess thionyl chloride is removed by rotary evaporation (HOOD!) and the residue is distilled using a Kugelrohr apparatus at 105°C (0.05 mm) to give 12.7–13.1 g of 2,3-dimethoxybenzoyl chloride, which crystallizes on cooling.

The gas inlet tube is replaced with a condenser and a thermometer which reaches below the level of the ethylene glycol, and 275 g. (4.2 moles) of reagent grade potassium hydroxide pellets (85% pure) is added in four portions. A constant-pressure dropping funnel containing 223 g. (0.92 moles) of diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate is connected and the reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen. The ethylene glycol solution is heated to 125° and the diethyl 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane-2,3-dicarboxylate is added as rapidly as is permitted by its viscous nature. The heating source is removed whenever the reaction temperature approaches 130°. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 125° for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool and then poured slowly into a 4-l. beaker which contains 1 kg. each of ice and water and 450 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (Caution. Vigorous foaming occurs). When the acidification is complete, the reaction mixture is warmed to about 40° and neutralized with 5N ammonium hydroxide. Half of this neutral solution is transferred to a second 4-l. beaker and subsequent operations are carried out on both batches.
To a 300-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a sealed stirrer, a condenser, and a gas inlet tube, is added a solution of 34 g. (0.11 mole) of 2-p-acetylphenylhydroquinone diacetate in 140 ml. of hot methanol. The solution is cooled to room temperature, causing some of the hydroquinone diacetate to crystallize. A slow stream of nitrogen is passed through the suspension, and 70 ml. of methanol containing 6.1 g. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride is added. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 2 hours under nitrogen, during which period the hydroquinone diacetate gradually dissolves. The pale yellow solution is poured onto 500 g. of chopped ice, and the colorless or faintly yellowish solid is collected by suction filtration and dried. The yield of p-acetylphenylhydroquinone melting at 193–194° is 24.8 g. (quantitative). The over-all yield of product based on quinone is 50–66%.

The solvent is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid distilled to yield 108–116 g. (81–86%) of colorless 2-benzyl-2-carbomethoxycyclopentanone, b.p. 126–128° (0.5 mm.).
A. 2-Chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate. A mixture of 1.0 g. of hydroquinone, 3 drops of a terpene inhibitor, and 140 g. (1.63 moles) of inhibited redistilled vinyl acetate is placed in a 400-ml. high-pressure shaker tube lined with stainless steel. The shaker tube is closed, cooled in a mixture of solid carbon dioxide and acetone, evacuated, and charged with 47 g. (0.40 mole) of chlorotrifluoroethylene. The shaker tube is heated with agitation to 215° in a period of about 1 hour and is then heated at 215° for 3 hours. The shaker tube is cooled to room temperature and is bled slowly to remove excess chlorotrifluoroethylene. The black, viscous reaction mixture is transferred to a distillation flask and heated on a steam bath. After a fore-run of dichlorohexafluorocyclobutane and vinyl acetate is collected at atmospheric pressure, a receiver cooled in solid carbon dioxide and acetone is attached, and crude 2-chloro-2,3,3-trifluorocyclobutyl acetate is rapidly distilled by gradually reducing the pressure to about 10 mm.. Redistillation through a 30-cm. column packed with glass helices provides 22–30 g. (27–37%) of the acetate, b.p. 60–65°/100 mm., nD25 1.3916–1.3921.
The crude material is dissolved in 60 ml. of absolute ethanol, the solution boiled with decolorizing carbon for a few minutes, and the clear, nearly colorless filtrate diluted with 100 ml. of hot benzene and 20 ml. of light petroleum ether (b.p. 60–80°). The white crystalline mass of o-chlorophenylthiourea, which separates gradually on cooling and standing, is separated by filtration under reduced pressure, washed with light petroleum ether, and dried, m.p. 144–146°. The yield of purified material is 20–24 g. (36–43%). Evaporation of the mother liquors and crystallization of the residue from a proportionally smaller volume of solvents yields a second crop (6–8 g.).

A current of air is bubbled through the solution for 24 hours; considerable heat is generated, and the initial green color soon changes to yellow. The yellow quinone that has separated is then filtered with suction and is washed, first with 200 ml. of water, then with 100 ml. of ethanol, and finally with 50 ml. of ether. The yield of air-dried product (m.p. 209–210°) is 36.5–37.5 g. (94–96%). The over-all yield for both steps is 90%.
A 250-ml. four-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a condenser protected by a drying tube, a thermometer, and a gas inlet.

A single-necked, flame-dried, 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum fitted with an argon inlet needle is flushed with argon and charged with triisopropylsilyl acetylene (95%, 6.1 mL, 4.75 g, 26.0 mmol) and dry THF (54 mL) by syringe through the septum. The reaction mixture is cooled to −40 °C (bath temperature) by means of a dry ice-acetonitrile bath and tert-BuLi (1.7 M in pentane, 18 mL, 32.3 mmol) is added dropwise by means of a syringe. The resulting bright yellow mixture is stirred at −40 °C for 30 min and then ACS reagent grade acetaldehyde (>99.5%, 2.3 mL, 39.2 mmol) is added in one portion by means of a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 20 min at −40 °C and then poured over a rapidly stirring solution of saturated aqueous NH4Cl (75 mL) at room temperature. After 15 min, the phases are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with diethyl ether (2 × 40 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator (40 °C, water aspirator pressure).

After addition is complete, stirring is continued for 0.5 hr with cooling. The gold-brown suspension is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 12 hr, during which time the color becomes more intense. The thermometer is removed and the mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hr to destroy the remaining chlorotrimethylsilane. After the condenser is cooled to room temperature, it is replaced with a nitrogen bubbler and gas inlet. Methyllithium-lithium bromide complex (66 mL, 99 mmol, 1.5 M in ether) is added over 3 hr to the grey-brown mixture with vigorous stirring. During the addition a continuous stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the reaction mixture. After the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 16 hr at room temperature, it acquires a greenish tint. Hydrolysis is carried out by the careful addition of the reaction mixture to 400 mL of ice-cold 2 N hydrochloric acid. [CAUTION: The solid residue may be highly pyrophoric. The checkers blanketed the flask with argon prior to the introduction of ether (100 mL) and poured the vigorously stirred slurry into the cold hydrochloric acid. This rinse procedure was repeated twice more.] The aqueous phase is extracted four times with 200-mL portions of pentane, the combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvents removed under reduced pressure. Distillation under reduced pressure (1 mm, 38°C) affords 13.4–17.2 g of the product as a clear oil (60–77% yield).

A solution of butyllithium in hexane (30.9 mL, 1.53 M, 0.047 mol) is added by syringe over 10 min at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below −75°C. As the butyllithium is added the precipitate slowly dissolves, leaving a clear, golden-yellow solution that is stirred for 15 min after the addition is complete. A solution of 27.0 g (0.11 mol) of iodine dissolved in 50 mL of dry THF is added via syringe to the reaction mixture at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below −70°C.

The flasks are placed in an ice-salt bath and chilled to 0°; to each flask there is then added 45 ml. (35.2 g., 0.78 mole) of acetaldehyde. When the contents of the flasks have cooled to −5° to 0° there is added to each flask, with shaking, a solution of 2 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol. The flasks, the contents of which become cloudy in a short time because of the separation of water, are kept in the ice-salt bath for 6 hours. The reaction mixtures are then combined in a 1-l. flask and placed in an icebox. About 24 hours later, 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with shaking, and the flask is replaced in an icebox until the next day. The addition of 3 ml. of piperidine in 5 ml. of absolute ethanol is repeated once more, and the mixture is again returned to the icebox for 24 hours. The mixture is then allowed to stand for at least 1 day at room temperature. At some point during this reaction period the mixture should crystallize as a mass of yellow-white needles.

The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at 35°C. The resulting pale yellow oil solidifies on standing to afford 31.0 g (99%) of crude product 1 as a pale yellow solid, which was used in the next step without further purification.
The benzimidazole is dissolved in 750 cc. of boiling water in a 1.5-l. beaker. The solution is digested for fifteen minutes with about 2 g. of Norite and filtered rapidly through a well-heated filter. The filtrate is cooled to 10–15°, and the benzimidazole is filtered and washed with 50 cc. of cold water. The white product is dried at 100°. The melting point is 170–172°, and the yield is 49–50.5 g. (83–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
The sirupy liquid is poured slowly, with stirring, into 1 kg. of ice to which just enough water has been added to make stirring easy. This decomposition of the excess chlorosulfonic acid should be carried out in the hood. The solid sulfonyl chloride which separates is collected on a suction funnel and washed with water. The yield of crude material is 90–95 g. (77–81 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the acetanilide).
A suspension of 61 g. (0.26 mole) of α-phenyl-β-benzoylpropionitrile1 in 150 ml. of methanol and 1 level teaspoonful of Raney nickel catalyst2,3 are placed in a 400–500 ml. pressure bottle connected to a low-pressure reduction apparatus. The bottle is alternatively evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice, and the reduction is conducted at 80–90° by shaking with hydrogen at an initial pressure of 50 lb. After 2 moles of hydrogen is absorbed the reduction is discontinued, the solution is filtered to separate the catalyst, and the solvent is removed from the green filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure. The crude 2,4-diphenyl-2-pyrroline is rinsed into a 300-ml. Kjeldahl flask with a little methanol, which is removed by distillation at reduced pressure (water pump) while the flask is immersed in a bath at 100°. Selenium (10 g.) is added, and the mixture is heated in a metal bath at 245–265° for 5 hours while a slow stream of nitrogen is passed over the surface of the liquid. This operation is conducted in a well-ventilated hood. The molten mass is poured from the reaction flask into a beaker, and the product is extracted with 300 ml. of boiling toluene. The green toluene solution is filtered through a cotton plug to remove a small amount of suspended selenium, and the filtrate is cooled. The 2,4-diphenylpyrrole separates as light green crystals which melt at 174–176° and weigh 24–26 g. (42–46%). A second crop of 2–3 g. (4–5%), m.p. 160–170°, can be obtained by concentrating the filtrate and cooling.
The combined moist filter cakes are placed in a 5-l. flask with 1.3 l. of water, and, with stirring, sufficient 40% sodium hydroxide solution is added to make the solution just alkaline to Clayton yellow paper; about 110 ml. is required. The mixture is heated to 85° and is filtered to remove a small amount of insoluble material. The filtrate is then made acid to Congo red by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 100 ml. of acid is required). The mixture is stirred for 15 minutes, and then enough 10% sodium acetate solution is added so that Congo red paper is no longer turned blue; the amount needed depends on the acidity; usually about 15 ml. is sufficient.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, is placed 3 kg. (1555 cc.) of fuming sulfuric acid (20 per cent of free sulfur trioxide). Then the flask is cooled very efficiently with a thick pack of ice and salt, until the temperature of the acid reaches −5°. The stirring is started, and 700 g. (3.64 moles) of finely powdered u. s. p. citric acid is added gradually. The speed of the addition is regulated according to the temperature of the reaction mixture. The temperature should not rise above 0° until half of the citric acid has been added, after which the temperature should not be allowed to exceed 10° until the reaction is complete. The addition requires three to four hours, provided efficient cooling is used. The citric acid should be in solution at the end of this time; if not, the stirring should be continued until it has dissolved completely.
(A) Ethyl Nitrite.—Two solutions are prepared. Solution I contains 620 g. (9 moles) of sodium nitrite (650 g. of technical 95 per cent quality), 210 g. (4.6 moles) of alcohol (285 cc. of 90 per cent denatured alcohol, or its equivalent), and water to make a total volume of 2.5 l. Solution II contains 440 g. of sulfuric acid (255 cc. of sp. gr. 1.84) and 210 g. of alcohol, diluted with water to 2.5 l. Ethyl nitrite may be generated continuously in gaseous form by allowing solution II to flow into solution I.
B. Racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a condenser is charged with 100 g (0.567 mol) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol, 50 mL (0.625 mol) of chloroacetyl chloride, 300 mg (0.0025 mol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), and 250 mL of dichloromethane. This mixture is rapidly stirred and heated at reflux for 6 hr. The mixture is cooled and a solution of 350 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate is carefully added to the rapidly stirring mixture. Stirring is maintained for 3 hr. The organic layer is separated and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After filtration the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30°C) to a dark-brown oil. This oil is distilled through a 2- or 4-in. column packed with glass beads to give, after collecting a small forerun (ca. 2 g), 135 g (94%) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate as a colorless liquid, bp 118–122°C at 0.3 mm.
D. 3-Methyl-2(5H)-furanone. To 10.9 g (50 mmol) of furyl tetramethyldiamidophosphate in 90 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), chilled to −75°C, is added 21.9 mL (55 mmol) of a 2.51 M hexane solution of butyllithium at a rate (6–10 min) such that the temperature reaches −60°C but does not exceed this level. The resulting mixture is chilled to −75°C for 10 min; then 8.9 g (63 mmol) of methyl iodide in 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added with a syringe during 7–8 min so that the temperature does not rise above −55°C. After the addition is complete, the temperature is raised to 0°C and the mixture is concentrated to ca. 40 mL. Water (30 mL) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) are added, the phases are separated, and the dark inorganic phase is extracted with two 50-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined, yellow organic phases are washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The solvent is evaporated to give 10.5 g of crude 2-(3-methylfuryl) tetramethyldiamidophosphate, which need not be purified for the next reaction.
B. 2-Trimethylsilylethylsulfonyl chloride (2) . The 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing sulfonate salt 1 (29.0 g) is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted at the top with a silicone oil bubbler connected through a rubber septum. The apparatus is purged with argon. The sodium sulfonate is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath and the addition funnel is charged with 80 mL (1.10 mol) of thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The slow, dropwise addition of SOCl2 to 1 is accompanied by generation of sulfur dioxide, SO2. After addition of the SOCl2 is complete, the addition funnel is removed, and the flask is fitted with a rubber septum and bubbler. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (0.40 mL, 0.38 g, 5.2 mmol) is slowly added via syringe resulting in a substantial increase in the evolution of SO2. The solution is stirred for an additional 20 min at 0°C during which time evolution of SO2 ceases. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight, resulting in a white precipitate. The reaction flask is fitted with a short path distillation head and excess SOCl2 is distilled off at reduced pressure. Twice the resulting white paste is diluted with 50 mL of hexanes and the residual SOCl2 and hexanes are removed under reduced pressure. The resulting pale tan slurry is once again diluted with 50 mL of hexanes and the slurry is filtered through a pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with an additional 50 mL of hexanes and the combined filtrate and washings are concentrated to afford 23.5 g of a light brown oil. Short path distillation of the crude oil using an oil bath as heat source (70-75°C at 0.2 mm) affords 19.3 - 22.0 g (~68-77% yield, or 53-66% overall yield from vinyltrimethylsilane) of the sulfonyl chloride 2 and as a pale tan oil.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-mL addition funnel and a Teflon-coated stirring bar is flame-dried under a stream of dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene (34.0 g, 0.20 mol) and dry dichloromethane (200 mL) and the solution is cooled to 0°C in an ice–water bath.
B. Indazolone. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask to which a reflux condenser is attached are placed 47.1 g. (0.25 mole) of o-hydrazinobenzoic acid hydrochloride, 1.25 l. of water, and 12.5 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The mixture is refluxed for 30 minutes. The resulting pale yellow solution is transferred in two portions to a 23-cm. evaporating dish and concentrated on the steam bath to about one-fourth its original volume. The indazolone separates at an early stage of the evaporation but redissolves as the concentration of acid increases. Sodium carbonate is added to the warm solution in small portions until the acid is neutralized, and the suspension is allowed to stand for 2 hours. The nearly colorless indazolone is removed by filtration, washed with two 25-ml. portions of cold water, and air-dried. The yield of product, m.p. 246–249°, is 30–33 g. (90–98%).
The crude material (91–92 g.) is purified by distillation under reduced pressure from a 250-cc. Claisen flask. The product distils at 160°/5 mm. (172°/15 mm.; 200°/30 mm.) as a colorless oil which solidifies on cooling. The yield is 81–82 g. (82–83 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the phenylacetic acid used) of a product which melts at 53–54°. The product is recrystallized from methyl alcohol, using 4 cc. of solvent for each gram of product; the yield is 55–56 g. of crystals melting at 55–56°. An additional 7 g. of crystals melting at 55–56° is obtained by cooling the filtrate in an ice-salt bath. On further cooling of the mother liquors, about 5 g. of crystals melting at 54–55° is obtained. The total yield of purified product is 67–70 g.. Further recrystallization of the product from methyl alcohol does not raise the melting point above 55–56°.
B. Furyl phosphorodichloridate. A 1-L flask, protected from moisture by a calcium chloride tube, is charged with 42 g (0.5 mol) of 2(5H)-furanone, 85 g (0.55 mol) of phosphoryl chloride, and 100 mL of methylene chloride. A solution of 65 g (0.5 mol) of ethyldiisopropylamine in 60 mL of methylene chloride is added dropwise during 4 hr at ambient temperature. The resulting mixture is stirred overnight (12 hr), after which 6.5 g of the amine in 10 mL of methylene chloride is added in one portion and stirring is continued for 20 hr. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator and 200 mL of dry ether is added cautiously, followed by 100 mL of pentane (in that order), to the dark residue to precipitate the amine hydrochloride. The flask is stoppered and shaken for 1–2 min. The hydrochloride is filtered by suction and washed immediately with 100 mL of dry ether and 200 mL of pentane or petroleum ether. The bottle is tightly stoppered and the filtrate is allowed to stand in the refrigerator (+4°C) overnight. The clear brown ethereal phase is decanted from a dark lower phase, and the solvent is evaporated. The residue (ca. 100 g) is distilled at the water pump. In order to obtain pure, color-stable, yellow dichloridate it is usually necessary to distill it twice. The first distillation is done rapidly, collecting the material that boils at 73–98°C (9 mm) to give 65–75 g of product, which usually darkens within a few days and. Redistillation, collecting the material that boils at 91–93°C (22 mm), 88–90°C (16 mm), or 73–76°C (9 mm), gives 60–65 g of pure product. The yield is 60–65%.
A. (1,4-Dioxaspiro[4.5]dec-7-en-8-yloxy)trimethylsilane ( 1 ). An oven-dried 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar, and one neck is fitted with a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, to which is attached a nitrogen inlet, and the second neck is sealed with a rubber septum. The reaction flask is charged with solid 1,4-cyclohexanedione mono-ethylene ketal (25.0 g, 160 mmol, 1.0 equiv), and then N,N-dimethylformamide (100 mL) is added to dissolve the solid. Triethylamine (52.0 mL, 368 mmol, 2.3 equiv) is added via syringe to the reaction vessel. Freshly distilled trimethylsilyl chloride (26.7 mL, 208 mmol, 1.3 equiv) is added to the addition funnel and then dispensed dropwise into the reaction vessel over a period of ~15 min. After the addition is complete, the addition funnel is replaced with a condenser, and the reaction mixture is then heated in an oil bath at 80 °C (bath temperature) for 12 h. After cooling to ambient temperature (23 °C), the reaction is quenched by addition of cold H2O (150 mL, cooled in an ice bath for 15 min), and the resulting mixture is diluted with hexanes (300 mL) and then transferred to a 1000-mL separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is removed and back-extracted with hexanes (2 × 100 mL). The combined hexane extracts are washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (1 × 100 mL), saturated aqueous NH4Cl (2 × 150 mL), and then brine (1 × 150 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (25 g) for 15 min and then concentrated on a rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, 30 °C). Further concentration under reduced pressure (0.5 mmHg, ambient temperature, 23 °C) delivers 32.6 g (89%) of the silyl enol ether 1 as a dark yellow oil, which is of sufficient purity for use in the subsequent step.
A. O-2-Naphthyl dimethylthiocarbamate. A solution of 21.6 g. (0.150 mole) of 2-naphthol in 100 ml. of water containing 8.4 g. (0.15 mole) of potassium hydroxide is cooled below 10° in a 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a 125-ml. addition funnel. A solution of 24.8 g. (0.201 mole) of N,N-dimethylthiocarbamyl chloride in 40 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added over 20–30 minutes to the stirred solution at such a rate that the temperature never exceeds 12°. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 10 minutes. The reaction mixture is made alkaline with 50 ml. of 10% potassium hydroxide and shaken three times with 100-ml. portions of benzene. The organic layers are combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride, and dried by filtration through anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation, giving the crude product. Crystallization from 75 ml. of absolute methanol yields 23.5–25.2 g. (68–73%) of O-2-naphthyl dimethylthiocarbamate, as colorless crystals, m.p. 90–90.5°.
The recrystallization is the least satisfactory part of this procedure and involves the greatest apparent loss of material; the product before recrystallization is sufficiently pure for most purposes. By evaporation of the mother liquors, 40–45 g. of pure nicotinic acid may be obtained, making the total yield of pure material 190–225 g. (63–74 per cent of the theoretical amount); in addition, a small amount of somewhat less pure material is recovered.
The cooled contents of the 250-ml. flask containing ferrous chloride are added to the cold sodium cyclopentadienide solution while passing a stream of nitrogen through both flasks. The combined mixture is stirred for 1.25 hours at a temperature just below reflux. Solvent is removed by distillation, and the ferrocene is extracted from the residue with several portions of refluxing petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°). The product is obtained by evaporation of the petroleum ether solution. Ferrocene may be purified by recrystallization from pentane or cyclohexane (hexane, benzene, and methanol have also been used) or by sublimation. The yield is 31–34 g. (67–73%), m.p. 173–174°.
The mixture is allowed to cool and is poured into 800 g. of ice and 800 ml. of water. After standing for 30 minutes the 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid is filtered with suction and washed with water until free of sulfates. The crude product weighs 62–65 g. and melts at 200–202°. This product is recrystallized from 275 ml. of hot 50% ethanol. The purified 3,5-dinitrobenzoic acid weighs 57–61 g. (54–58%) and melts at 205–207°.
To a freshly prepared solution of 0.187 mole of triphenylmethylsodium (p. 607), contained in the flask into which it was transferred after preparation, is added 21.7 g. (25 cc., 0.187 mole) of pure ethyl isobutyrate. The mixture is shaken, and, after it has stood at room temperature for ten minutes, a solution of 26 g. (21.5 cc., 0.186 mole) of pure benzoyl chloride in 50 cc. of dry ether is added, with shaking. The mixture becomes warm, and a white precipitate of sodium chloride separates immediately. After standing at room temperature for several hours the mixture is heated on a water bath and ether is distilled until the volume is reduced to 300–400 cc. A solution of 5 cc. of acetic acid in 300 cc. of water is added, and the mixture is shaken in a separatory funnel until two homogeneous layers separate on standing. The aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded; the ethereal layer is shaken with 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution and dried over calcium chloride or Drierite. The solution is filtered from the drying agent and distilled on a water bath until most of the ether is removed. The residue is cooled in a refrigerator, and the triphenylmethane which crystallizes is filtered with suction and washed with several small portions of dry ether. The filtrate, after removal of ether, is distilled under reduced pressure and all material boiling up to 180° at 15 mm. collected. The distillate is redistilled and the fraction boiling up to 160° at 15 mm. is subjected to a final redistillation. There is obtained 20.5–22.5 g. (50–55 per cent of the theoretical amount) of ethyl benzoyldimethylacetate, b.p. 146–148° at 15 mm. or 133–135° at 9 mm and.
The flask is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath, and the Grignard reagent solution is added dropwise with rapid stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains between −25° and −30° with a bath temperature of −45°; this addition requires about 1.5 hours. After the addition has been completed, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Finally, the reaction mixture is heated to reflux with continuous stirring for 30 minutes.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, are placed 500 g. (531 cc., 5.7 moles) of ethyl acetate, and 50 g. (2.2 atoms) of clean sodium wire or finely sliced sodium is added. The reaction is at first quite slow, and must be started by warming on a water bath. After the reaction is once started it proceeds vigorously and cooling is then necessary in order to avoid loss of material through the condenser. When the rapid reaction slows down, the reaction mixture is heated on a water bath until the sodium has completely dissolved. This usually requires about one and one-half hours. At this stage the reaction mixture should be a clear red liquid with a green fluorescence.
A solution of 1.65 kg. of crystallized glucose or 1.5 kg. of anhydrous glucose (8.3 moles) is prepared by heating the solid on a steam bath with 1.35 l. of distilled water. The solution is cooled and placed in a 2.5-1. glass-stoppered bottle. Fifteen grams of emulsin is added, then 20 ml. of toluene, and the flask is closed and allowed to stand at room temperature, with occasional shaking, for 5 weeks. The solution is then boiled, diluted with 8.5 l. of water, and filtered. To the filtrate is added 56 g. of baker's yeast in 650 ml. of water, and the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 28–32° for 12–14 days. The mixture is then boiled for 30 minutes with an excess of powdered calcium carbonate and filtered.
A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with stirrer, thermometer, condenser, and dropping funnel is purged with dry nitrogen and charged with 16 g. (0.33 mole) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil and 100 ml. of dry benzene. To this stirred mixture is added dropwise over a 45–50 minute period 74.7 g. (0.33 mole) of triethyl phosphonoacetate. During the addition period the temperature is maintained at 30–35°, and cooling is employed if necessary. Vigorous evolution of hydrogen is noted during this portion of the reaction. After addition of triethyl phosphonoacetate is completed, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour at room temperature to ensure complete reaction. To this nearly clear solution is added dropwise over a 30–40 minute period 32.7 g. (0.33 mole) of cyclohexanone. During the addition the temperature is maintained at 20–30° by appropriate cooling with an ice bath. After approximately one-half of the ketone is added, a gummy precipitate of sodium diethyl phosphate forms, which in some instances makes agitation difficult. The mixture is then heated at 60–65° for 15 minutes, during which time it is stirred without difficulty. The resulting product is cooled to 15–20°, and the mother liquor is decanted from the precipitate. This gummy precipitate is washed well by mixing it at 60° with several 25-ml. portions of benzene and decanting at 20°. Benzene is distilled from the combined mother and wash liquors at atmospheric pressure. The product is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column, and the mineral oil remains as pot residue after distillation is completed. Ethyl cyclohexylideneacetate (37–43 g., 67–77% yield) is collected at 48–49° (0.02 mm.), n25D 1.4755.
A. 3-Butyl-4,4-dichlorocyclobutenone. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two glass stoppers, and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The flask is charged with 39.23 g (0.60 mol) of zinc–copper couple, 400 mL of diethyl ether, and 23.0 mL (0.20 mol) of 1-hexyne. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 44.6 mL (0.40 mol) of trichloroacetyl chloride in 125 mL of dimethoxyethane, and this solution is then added dropwise to the reaction mixture over 1 hr. After 18 hr, the resulting brown mixture is filtered through a sintered-glass Büchner funnel, and the black solid that is separated is thoroughly washed with 200 mL of hexane. The filtrate is washed successively with 200 mL each of ice-cold 0.5 N hydrochloric acid, ice-cooled 5% sodium hydroxide solution, and saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and then concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residual brown oil is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask and distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to afford 29.5–30.0 g (76–78%) of 3-butyl-4,4-dichlorocyclobutenone as a colorless liquid, bp 68.5–70°C (0.3 mm).
B. Ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-tert-butyloxycarbonyl-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl-glycinate.3 A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, reflux condenser, and two stoppers, is charged with 167 mL of a solution of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 34.2 g (0.585 mol) of sodium chloride (NaCl), 350 mL of chloroform (CHCl3), 25 g (0.084 mol) of ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl)glycinate, and 36.5 g (0.167 mol) of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate. The resulting mixture is then heated to reflux for 20 hr and vigorously stirred.
The reaction mixture is poured into a mixture of 300 mL of toluene and 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The resulting milky solution is washed twice with 100-mL portions of deionized water and twice with 100-mL portions of brine and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure in a 50°C bath. The semisolid residue is slurried in 55 mL of ether and then collected by filtration on a sintered-glass funnel. After the solid is washed 4 times with 10 mL of ether, it is set aside and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness. The residue is slurried in 10 mL of ether. The solid is collected on a glass frit and washed twice with 10 mL of ether. Both solids are combined and dried under reduced pressure to give 16.4 g (45.2 mmol) (79%) of phosphate as an off-white powder, mp 215–217°C; [α]D25 −526.8° (THF, c 1.16).
In a 2-l. flask equipped with a reflux condenser, mercury-sealed stirrer, and a dropping funnel are placed 147 ml. (114 g., 1.5 moles) of tert-butyl alcohol, 212 ml. (202 g., 1.67 moles) of dimethylaniline, and 200 ml. of dry ether. The solution is heated to refluxing, and 113 ml. (124 g., 1.58 moles) of acetyl chloride is run into the stirred solution at such a rate that moderate refluxing continues after the source of heat is removed. When approximately two-thirds of the acetyl chloride has been added, dimethylaniline hydrochloride begins to crystallize and the mixture refluxes very vigorously. An ice bath is applied immediately, and, after refluxing ceases, the remainder of the acetyl chloride is added. Finally, the mixture is heated for 1 hour on a water bath. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, approximately 200 ml. of water is added, and stirring is continued until all the solid material dissolves. The ether layer is separated and extracted with 50-ml. portions of cold 10% sulfuric acid until the extract does not become cloudy when made alkaline with sodium hydroxide. After a final washing with 25 ml. of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, the ether solution is dried by shaking it with 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is decanted and allowed to stand over 10 g. of Drierite overnight. The solution is filtered, and the ether is removed by distillation through a good fractionating column. The residue is fractionally distilled, and 110–119 g. (63–68%) of tert-butyl acetate boiling at 95–98° is obtained. Most of the ester boils at 97.0–97.5°.
A. 2-(N-Mesitylenesulfonyl)amino-1-phenyl-1-propanol , 2 . To a stirred solution of (−)-norephedrine (30.2 g, 0.200 mol) and triethylamine (33.4 mL, 0.24 mol) in dichloromethane (400 mL) is added mesitylenesulfonyl chloride (43.8 g, 0.20 mol) at 0°C. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for 2 hr and diluted with diethyl ether (600 mL). The mixture is washed successively with 100 mL each of water, 1 M hydrochloric acid(HCl), water, saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and brine, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate . The organic solution is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated to give an oily residue, which is dissolved in dichloromethane (50 mL). Hexane (100 mL) is added in portions with swirling to the dichloromethane solution to cause crystallization. Additional hexane (300 mL) is added and the crystalline (1R, 2S)- 2 (60.8 g, 91%) is isolated by filtration.
B. Methyl 2-hexynoate. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser is charged with 12.62 g. (0.1002 mole) of 3-(1-propyl)-2-pyrazolin-5-one and 500 ml. of methanol. To this solution, 93.20 g. (0.2097 mole) of thallium(III) nitrate trihydrate is slowly added so as to avoid foaming. The reaction mixture is stirred for 20 minutes at room temperature and 20 minutes at reflux and, then reduced to approximately half its volume by evaporation on a rotary evaporator. It is then cooled to 0–5° and filtered through fluted filter paper, removing precipitated thallium(I) nitrate. The filter cake is washed with 150 ml. of chloroform, and 250 ml. of water is added to the filtrate. The chloroform layer is separated, and two additional extractions with 100 ml. of chloroform are carried out. The combined chloroform layers are washed once with 100 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, twice with 100 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The chloroform is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is filtered through a 2 cm. by 12 cm. column of 100–200 mesh Florisil using approximately 250 ml. of chloroform as eluent. The chloroform is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the resulting pale yellow liquid is vacuum distilled through a 19-cm., unpacked column, yielding 8.63–9.24 g. (68–73%) of methyl 2-hexynoate, b.p. 47–50° (5 mm.), as a colorless to slightly yellow liquid.
E. (E, E, E)-Geranylgeraniol. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two rubber septa, and a nitrogen inlet connected to a mineral oil bubbler, is charged with ester 5 (9.58 g, ~ 28.8 mmol) and toluene (100 mL). The solution is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath (temperature −78 °C), and diisobutylaluminum hydride in hexanes (86.4 mL, 86.4 mmol) is added slowly via syringe through one of the septa over 20 min. After 30 min at −78 °C, the reaction is quenched by careful addition of methanol (10 mL) via a glass pipette over approximately 10 min. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and poured into a mixture of saturated NH4Cl (250 mL) and 1N HCl (250 mL) with stirring, and the stirring is continued for 30 min. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ether (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are sequentially washed with water (2 × 200 mL) and brine (2 × 200 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporator and vacuum drying. The concentrated residue is loaded onto a column (5.0 × 21 cm) of 200 g of silica gel and eluted with 300 mL of hexanes. At that point, collection of 50-mL fractions in glass tubes (25 × 150 mm) is begun, while elution is continued with 500 mL of 5% EtOAc-hexanes, 500 mL of 10% EtOAc-hexanes, 500 mL of 15% EtOAc-hexanes, and then 500 mL of 20 % EtOAc-hexanes. The fractions are analyzed by TLC on silica gel with 30% EtOAc-hexanes as eluent and visualized with p-anisaldehyde staining reagent. The product is obtained in fractions 24–42, which are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield geranylgeraniol (7.20 g, overall 70% from β-keto ester 3).
The solution of ca. 0.30 mol of cyclopentadienylsodium is decanted from residual sodium sand with a U-tube into the dropping funnel and is added dropwise over a 2-hr period. A white precipitate of sodium bromide forms during the addition. The heterogeneous solution is stirred overnight at −78°C to ensure complete formation of methyl 2,4-cyclopentadiene-1-acetate.
The ether extracts are transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, the ether is removed by distillation, and the residue of crude mandelic acid is dried by warming it on a steam bath under the vacuum of a water pump. About 400 ml. of benzene is added, and the mixture is distilled until 100 ml. of distillate is collected. The acid in the residual mixture is brought completely into solution by the addition of 6–10 ml. of ethanol. The hot solution is then filtered through a warm Büchner funnel, and the filtrate is cooled overnight at 6°. The first crop of pure mandelic acid weighs 100–120 g. A second crop is obtained by evaporation of the mother liquor to about one-fourth its volume; this weighs 20–40 g. The total yield is 136–144 g. (85–90% based on the dichloroacetophenone, or 76–87% based on the acetophenone). The white crystalline product melts at 115–117°.
These combined fractions (which boil up to 210°) and 15 g. of sodium are placed in a 2-l. distilling flask, the side arm of which is closed with a rubber tube and pinchcock and which is fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated just below the boiling point for about three hours, during which time the impurities are attacked by the molten sodium, and a gelatinous, reddish mass forms. The reflux condenser is now removed and one set for downward distillation is attached to the side arm. The mixture is distilled and about two-thirds of the liquid removed in this way. The residue is cooled, the liquid poured off from solid material and distilled up to 210°.
B. N-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a nitrogen inlet, mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 93 g (210 mmol) of lead tetraacetate and 250 mL of glacial acetic acid. Stirring is started, the flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and the funnel is charged with a solution of 61 g (200 mmol) of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methylene-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline in 250 mL of methylene chloride. This solution is added at such a rate that a temperature of 19–23°C is maintained throughout the addition, typically over a period of 15 to 20 min. The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. Glycerol (4 mL) is added to quench unreacted lead tetraacetate, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 10 min.
Isolation of the (−)-(camphorsulfonyl)imine is accomplished by removal of the toluene on the rotary evaporator. The resulting solid is recrystallized from absolute ethanol (750 mL) to give white crystals, 34.5–36.4 g (90–95%), mp 225–228°C; [α]D −32.7° (CHCl3, c 1.9).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a rubber stopper, holding a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser and separatory funnel, is placed 1 kg. (10.6 moles) of phenol dissolved in 1 l. of carbon disulfide. To the top of the condenser is attached a calcium chloride tube and from this a glass tube leads into a beaker holding about 1200 cc. of cracked ice and water for the absorption of the hydrogen bromide evolved. In the separatory funnel is placed 1702 g. (546 cc., 10.7 moles) of bromine dissolved in 500 cc. of carbon disulfide. The flask is well cooled (below + 5°) in a salt and ice mixture, stirring is started, and the bromine solution is allowed to run in. The addition requires about two hours. When this is completed, the flask is disconnected, and a condenser set for downward distillation is attached to it. By having a distilling flask as a receiver attached tightly to the lower end of the condenser, the dissolved hydrogen bromide which is evolved at the beginning of the heating may be led into the water used for collecting the first hydrogen bromide.
A. Methyl 1,3-dimethyl-5-oxobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylate.2 An oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with 100 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and 5.56 g (55 mmol) of anhydrous diisopropylamine. The flask is flushed with argon via a needle inlet–outlet and cooled to −78°C with a dry ice–isopropyl alcohol bath,(Note 2),(Note 3). To the stirred solution is added dropwise with a syringe 30 mL (54 mmol) of a 1.8 M solution of butyllithium in hexane to form lithium diisopropylamide, followed after 30 min by a solution of 5.50 g (50 mmol) of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one in 60 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran via a flex-needle over a 15-min period. Stirring and cooling is continued for an additional 30 min. To the resulting yellow solution of the lithium dienolate, 10.0 g (0.1 mol) of methyl (E)-crotonate is added with a syringe within 2 min. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Stirring is continued at room temperature for 2 hr. The reaction mixture is quenched by adding 1 N hydrochloric acid until the mixture turns acidic. Extraction with three 80-mL portions of dichloromethane followed by evaporation of the solvent yields a light-yellow oil that is taken up in 100 mL of diethyl ether. This solution is filtered through 100 g of silica gel to remove polymers and water. Elution with diethyl ether and evaporation of the solvent gives a yellow oil that is distilled in a Kugelrohr distillation apparatus under reduced pressure. After a small forerun (ca. 0.5 g of unreacted 3-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one) at 50°C, 0.05 mm, the main fraction is collected at 110–120°C (oven temperature), 0.05 mm to give 8.25–9.43 g (78–90%) of a colorless oil, which solidifies on standing in the freezer. One recrystallization from cold pentane (approximately 10 mL of pentane per 8 g of ester mixture) gives 6.0 g of product as white crystals, mp 37°C, of approximately 97% isomeric purity.
B. 1-Chloronorbornane. A 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser fitted with a drying tube, and a stopper is charged with 230 g. (1.39 moles) of 2,2-dichloronorbornane and 3 l. of pentane. The solution is stirred as 87.0 g. (0.652 mole) of aluminum chloride is added over 4.5 hours. The mixture is stirred for 40 hours, during which time hydrogen chloride gas evolves and a brown sludge accumulates on the walls of the flask. The supernatant pentane solution is decanted, and the brown sludge remaining in the flask is thoroughly extracted with four 200-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane extracts are washed with three 600-ml. portions of water and one 600-ml. portion of saturated sodium chloride. The combined aqueous washes are extracted with two additional 500-ml. portions of pentane, which are combined with the preceding pentane solution and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The pentane solution is concentrated by distillation through a 3 × 30 cm. Vigreux column, and the residual liquid is distilled, affording 110–114 g. (60–63%) of 1-chloronorbornane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 70–74° (55 mm.), which solidifies on standing at room temperature.
The clear yellow solution is recooled to 0° in an ice bath before a solution of 88 g. (0.80 mole) of freshly-distilled ethyl bromide in 100 ml. of pure pentane is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-minute period while the solution warms to room temperature. Formation of a precipitate begins after an hour and is virtually complete after 6 hours. After the mixture has been stirred for 2 days, 400 ml. of 4 N hydrochloric acid is carefully added with cooling (ice bath) and stirring. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with 15 ml. of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Low-boiling materials are removed by distillation through an efficient Vigreux column. The residue is distilled using a spinning-band apparatus, yielding 35.2–35.8 g. (64–65%) of 3-ethyl-1-hexyne as a colorless, pungent oil, b.p. 113–114°, nD20 1.4101.
B. (E)-7,11-Dimethyl-6,10-dodecadien-2-yn-1-ol. To the suspension containing the acetylide intermediate 2, as prepared in Part A, is added 14 g (460 mmol) of paraformaldehyde in portions over 10 min. After stirring the mixture for 24 hr, the resulting suspension is poured into 450 mL of ice-cold water, the aqueous layer is saturated with sodium chloride, and the product is extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is removed at room temperature on a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a short-path distillation apparatus to provide a forerun of 2-butyn-1-ol (bp 42–46°C, 6 mm), followed by 10.5 g (68% yield) of (E)-7,11-dimethyl-6,10-dodecadien-2-yn-1-ol as a colorless liquid, bp 120–124°C (0.5 mm).
A. Hydroxymethylimidazole picrate. To 222 g. (1 mole) of basic cupric carbonate in a 5-l. flask are added 1.5 l. of distilled water and 720 g. (800 ml., 12 moles) of 28% ammonia. The bulk of the copper carbonate is brought into solution by swirling; 112 g. (100 ml., 1.3–1.4 moles) of 37–40% formaldehyde and 90 g. (0.475 mole) of commercial 95% fructose are added. The solution is well mixed and placed on a steam bath under a hood. After 30 minutes of heating with occasional shaking, a moderate current of air is bubbled through the solution (500–600 ml. per minute), with continued heating, for 2 hours longer.
In an 800-ml. stainless-steel flanged beaker are placed 240 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets and 50 ml. of water. When the mush has cooled, 40.0 g. (0.263 mole) of 2-hydroxy-3-methylbenzoic acid is added, and the slurry is stirred with a long glass rod. The beaker is placed firmly in a clamp and set in a cold oil bath in a hood, and 240 g. (1.00 mole) of lead dioxide is stirred in all at once. The oil bath is now heated by a flame, and when the bath temperature reaches 200° steady manual stirring by means of the glass rod is begun. (Caution! Goggles and a rubber glove should be worn to protect eyes and the stirring hand against spattering.) The temperature is raised, with steady stirring, until the bath reaches 238–240°, when the flame is moderated to maintain this bath temperature. Several minutes after 240° is reached, the mixture boils steadily and the lumpy brown mass turns quickly to a bright-orange melt containing heavy crystals of lead monoxide. The bath is held at 240° for another 15 minutes. It is then brought briefly to 250°, the flame is removed, and the beaker is lifted out of the bath.
B. Cuprous iodide-triethyl phosphite complex (2).. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and reflux condenser is flame-dried under nitrogen. The vessel is charged with 38.2 g (0.20mol) of cuprous iodide, 33.4 mL (0.20 mol) of triethyl phosphite and 400 mL of dry toluene (distilled from CaH2). The mixture is stirred at 80°C for 8 hr, cooled to room temperature, and filtered under reduced pressure on a pad of Celite. The solvent is removed from the filtrate successively with a rotary evaporator and briefly (15 min) under high vacuum. The residual solid is recrystallized from ether (25 mL) to yield 41.1–49.9 g (57.4–69.8%) of cuprous iodidetriethyl phosphite complex in two crops, mp 114–115°C.
The distilling flask is now attached to a condenser set for downward distillation, and the benzene is distilled. As soon as the quinone starts to separate, the residue in the flask is transferred to a beaker and cooled in an ice bath. The precipitate is filtered off with suction and the product spread out for a short time to dry. The product is yellow in color and weighs 75 to 80 g. (76–81 per cent of the theoretical amount). Material made in this way will hold its yellow color over long periods of time, provided it is protected from light.
Lithium diisopropylamide is prepared in a separate 1-L flask from diisopropylamine (22.8 g, 31.6 mL, 225 mmol), butyllithium in hexane (2.22 M, 101 mL, 225 mmol), and THF (200 mL), as described above. To this is added over approximately 45 min at −78°C reaction mixture A prepared above via a 16-G double-ended needle under a slight pressure of nitrogen. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2–3 hr and is quenched with water (200 mL) at 0°C. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with pentane (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layer is treated with ice-cold hydrochloric acid (1 N, 200 mL), water (2 × 100 mL), and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (100 mL) to pH ≥8. After drying over magnesium sulfate, the volatile compounds are evaporated using a rotary evaporator at ca. 20 mm. The residue is distilled at 0.7 mm to provide (E)-buten-3-ynyl-2,6,6-trimethyl-1-cyclohexene in one fraction boiling at 69–73°C (0.7 mm). The yield by isolation has ranged from 12.5 g (72%) to 14.8 g (85%). The purity of the product by GLC is 98%.
The upper oily layer is then separated with the aid of a separatory funnel. It is washed with 50-ml. portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution until the washings are no longer acidic to Congo red. It is finally washed 4 times with an equal volume of water and dried over calcium chloride. The yield is 78–107 g. (72–99%); d2020 0.910; n20D 1.403. The product is best stored under an inert atmosphere in sealed bottles kept in the dark in a refrigerator.
The yield is the same as that obtained by method (A).
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a separatory funnel, reflux condenser, and stirrer, is placed 27 g. (1.1 atoms) of magnesium turnings. A mixture of 30 g. of bromobenzene and 70 cc. of dry ether is run in and the flask warmed gently until the reaction becomes rapid. Stirring is then started, and the vessel is surrounded by a dish of cold water. A mixture of 151 g. of bromobenzene (total: 181 g., 1.15 moles) and 380 cc. of dry ether is run in at such a rate as to cause vigorous refluxing; when the addition is complete (one hour) the whole is stirred for ten minutes.
A. 2-Chloroethyl benzoate. In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask attached to a 100-cm. air condenser by a ground-glass joint are placed 80.5g. (66ml., 1 mole) of redistilled ethylene chlorohydrin (b.p. 128–129°) and 140.5 g. (115.5 ml., 1 mole) of benzoyl chloride. The apparatus is set up in a good hood, and the mixture is warmed gently with a low flame until the reaction starts. The source of heat is withdrawn until the reaction moderates and is then again applied for an additional 30 minutes, during which time the temperature rises to about 200–215°. The flask is fitted with a short column (about 20 cm.) and arranged for distillation. After volatile material has been removed by evacuation with a water pump at a bath temperature of 100–110° the residual liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure. The yield of 2-chloroethyl benzoate boiling at 101–104°/2 mm. is 165–168 g. (89–91%), nD19 1.5298.
(B) Cyclization.—The above oil is poured slowly into 500 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, the temperature being kept at 20–25° by cooling in an ice bath. After standing for one and one-half hours at 20–25°, the deep red solution is poured on 3 l. of ice and water. The anhydride, precipitated as a pale yellow solid, is collected and washed thoroughly with water. Dried in vacuo at 25°, the material weighs 40–45 g. and melts at 117–122°. Distillation under diminished pressure gives a light yellow product, m.p. 122–124°. The yield is 38–42 g. (73–81 per cent of the theoretical amount). This material is suitable for most purposes. Crystallization from 100 cc. of benzene with the addition of 75 cc. of ligroin (b.p. 60–80°) gives 34–41 g. of pale yellow prisms, m.p. 125–126°.
B. (−)-(S,S)-Bis(4-isopropyloxazoline) (4): An oven-dried 500 mL, 2-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar and a 50 mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel connected to a mineral oil bubbler is purged with nitrogen and charged with (−)-(S,S)-N,N'-bis-(1-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropyl)-2,2-dimethylmalonamide (3, 5.5 g, 18.4 mmol), 4-dimethylaminopyridine (0.204 g, 1.67 mmol, Note 6) and dry dichloromethane (130 mL, Note 4). The flask is immersed in a water bath at room temperature and triethylamine (10.25 mL, 73.4 mmol, Note 2) is added slowly via syringe. Subsequently, tosyl chloride (7.10 g, 37 mmol, 2.0 equiv., Note 7), dissolved in dry dichloromethane (15 mL), is added dropwise over 30 minutes via the addition funnel. After completion of the addition, the funnel is rinsed with dry dichloromethane (2.5 mL) and the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 27 h at room temperature. The reaction mixture is treated with saturated NH4Cl solution (70 mL) followed by water (40 mL). The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 55 mL), and the combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4. The organic solution is filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The oily residue is treated with hot pentane (40 mL, Note 9), stirred for 5 min and the supernatant liquid is decanted. This procedure is repeated three times and the collected pentane layers are combined and concentrated under vacuum to yield 4 (4.05 g, 15.2 mmol, 83%, Note 10) as a colorless oil.
The flask is surrounded by an ice-calcium chloride cooling mixture, and the aluminum chloride is added in small portions from the Erlenmeyer flask at such a rate that the temperature is maintained between −5° and 0°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, and the temperature is then allowed to rise slowly to 10°. The red complex which forms is collected with suction on a sintered-glass funnel and washed thoroughly with dry benzene. The complex is added in small portions by means of a spatula with stirring to a 600-ml. beaker nearly filled with a mixture of ice and concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is then allowed to come to room temperature, and the crude ketone is collected on a suction filter.
Potassium metal (78 g.; 2 moles) is cut into chunks just small enough to pass through the neck of the right flask; these are stored in a beaker under xylene until needed. About 5 g. of potassium is introduced into the right flask by briefly lifting the two-holed stopper. The right stirrer is started and the potassium is allowed to dissolve. To the resulting deep blue solution is added 0.1 g. of finely crushed ferric nitrate hydrate, a catalyst for the reaction of potassium with ammonia. The solution should begin to boil with evolution of hydrogen. ( Caution: No flames or sparks should be nearby.) The rest of the potassium is added at such a rate as to maintain active gas evolution. Stirring is continued in the right flask until all the potassium is consumed, i.e., until the blue color disappears. The right flask now contains a solution of potassium amide in liquid ammonia; 30–60 minutes is required for its preparation.
C. (+)-(1S,2S)-Cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid. (−)-Dimenthyl (1S,2S)-cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylate (4.06 g, 10 mmol, [α]D25 + 17.8°) is dissolved in 20 mL of a 10% potassium hydroxide solution in 9 : 1 methanol/water in a 50-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The solution is heated at 60°C with an oil bath. Progress of the reaction is monitored by TLC on silica gel, using 1 : 1 hexane/ethyl acetate as eluant. After about 4 hr the resulting two-phase mixture is diluted with 20 mL of water and extracted with three 40-mL portions of ether. The aqueous layer is acidified by the addition of 20 mL of ice-cold 6 N hydrochloric acid, saturated with ca. 5 g of sodium chloride, and extracted with five 40-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate, diluted with 5 mL of hexane, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Filtration provides 1.17 g (90%) of (+)-(1S,2S)-cyclopropane-1,2-dicarboxylic acid, mp 172–173°C, [α]D25 +228° (ethanol, c 1.01) [lit.2 mp 169.5–170°C, [α]D25 +227.9° (ethanol, c 2.342)].
Through the separatory funnel is added slowly 500 cc. of 50 per cent (sp. gr. 1.40) sulfuric acid (3.6 moles), which is somewhat more than the amount required to neutralize the alkali (6.25 moles) used in the saponification of the ester. When the evolution of carbon dioxide ceases to be vigorous, the reaction mixture is heated slowly to boiling, and from one-third to one-half of the total volume is distilled. The distillate is made alkaline with solid sodium hydroxide and redistilled until 80–90 per cent has been collected.
The residue is dissolved in fifteen to twenty times its weight of methyl alcohol and filtered, and an excess of pyridine is added. The free amino acid separates on standing overnight. It is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed thoroughly with methyl alcohol, and dried. The yield is 92–102 g. (30–33 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a pyridine-free product is desired, it is dissolved in 200 cc. of warm water and filtered, and the filtrate is poured into 2 l. of methyl alcohol. There is less than 10 g. of product in the mother liquors. It may be isolated by evaporating to dryness, washing with methyl alcohol, and purifying by reprecipitation in the same way.
B. 1,4-Diphenylbutadiene. To a solution of 60.0 g. (0.145 mole) of triphenylcinnamylphosphonium chloride and 16.4 g. (0.155 mole) of benzaldehyde in 200 ml. of ethanol is added 760 ml. of 0.2M lithium ethoxide in ethanol and. After allowing this mixture to stand 30 minutes, 700 ml. of water is added and the colorless crystals are filtered, washed with 150 ml. of 60% ethanol, and dried in the vacuum oven at 65°. The yield of crystalline product, m.p. 153–156°, is 17.9–19.9 g. (60–67%). The product is the trans-trans isomer and is pure enough for most purposes. Recrystallization from cyclohexane gives a product with m.p. 154–156°.
The sec-butylmalonic acid is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether, and the combined extracts are dried over calcium chloride overnight. The ether solution is then decanted into a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel. Five milliliters of bromine is added at one time, and the solution is stirred until decolorized. Then 50 ml. more bromine is added dropwise at such a rate that the ether refluxes gently. When all the bromine has been added, 200 ml. of water is added through the dropping funnel dropwise so as to produce no foaming or violent reaction.
The apparatus used is shown in Fig. 6. A solution of sodium ethoxide prepared by dissolving 2.5 g. (0.11 g. atom) of clean sodium in 230 g. (292 ml., 5 moles) of absolute ethanol under anhydrous conditions is added to the reaction tube C. Tube C thus charged is weighed and placed in position with the gas inlet tube, fitted with fritted-glass dispersion cylinder D, extending nearly to the bottom. Several inches of ethanol is placed in tube G, which serves as a flow indicator. The traps A and F are provided to protect against suck-back if the gas flow is interrupted. The seal at B is a sleeve of rubber tubing. Any efficient reflux condenser E is satisfactory.
In a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a liquid-sealed stirrer and two reflux condensers is placed 40 g. (0.27 mole) of anhydrous, powdered d-tartaric acid. A solution of 1.2 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 136 g. (126 ml., 1.33 moles) of acetic anhydride is added, and the stirrer is started. The mixture warms up, and the tartaric acid goes into solution. The solution is heated gently under reflux with stirring for 10 minutes. The solution is poured into a beaker and cooled for 1 hour in an ice bath. The crude crystalline product is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel, washed twice with 20-ml. portions of dry benzene, stirred mechanically with 175 ml. of cold absolute ether, filtered, and placed in a vacuum desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide and paraffin shavings for 24 hours. The yield of diacetyl-d-tartaric anhydride is 41–44.5 g. (71–77%), m.p. 133–134°, [α]D20 97.2° in dry chloroform (c = 0.47).
Method 2. The apparatus described above is charged with 4.8–5.0 g. (~0.2 g.-atom) of clean sodium and 8.0–8.2 g. (~0.2 g.-atom) of clean potassium,. The flask is heated with a heat gun, forming the low-melting alloy, and 300–350 ml. of anhydrous ether is added from a freshly opened can. The stirrer is operated at full speed until the alloy is dispersed, then at a slower speed for the remainder of the reaction,. A mixture of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of diethylsuccinate, 44 g. (0.41 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane, and 125 ml. of anhydrous ether is added at a rate sufficient to keep the reaction under control. The purple mixture is stirred for another 4–6 hours, then filtered and washed as above in a nitrogen dry-box. The product is distilled as above, collecting a forerun, 0.5–2 g. to 80° (10 mm.), and then the product at 82–86° (10 mm.) as a colorless liquid, 13.8–16.1 g. (60–70%), n25D 1.4323–1.4330,(Note 16),(Note 17),(Note 18),(Note 19).
E. (R)-(+)-2-Diphenylphosphino-2'-methoxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (6). A 250-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is charged with crude 5, 7 mL (50 mmol) of triethylamine (Et3N), and 84 mL of toluene .. The mixture is cooled to 0°C then 4 mL (40 mmol) of trichlorosilane (Cl3SiH) is added via syringe. The reaction is heated to 120°C and stirred for 5 hr. Upon cooling to ambient temperature the reaction is diluted with Et2O and quenched with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate. The resulting suspension is filtered through a Celite pad, and the filter cake is washed with Et2O. The organic phase is dried over MgSO4 then concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 4.94 g of a yellow solid. This crude material is dissolved in a minimal amount of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) and chromatographed on a 10 × 30-cm column containing 615 g of silica gel (SiO2). The column is eluted with Et2O to afford 4.08 g (8.71 mmol, 86% yield over last 3 steps) of 6 as an off-white powder.
Six hundred and eighty-five grams (4.75 moles) of technical anthranilic acid (generally about 95 per cent pure) is dissolved in 1.5 l. of water and 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.17), by heating. The insoluble dark impurity present in small amounts is filtered off, and the filtrate is transferred to a 16-l. crock and chilled with stirring. It is then mixed with a mush of 2.5 kg. of ice and 750 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The crock is cooled externally with ice, and the contents stirred continuously. When the temperature reaches about 3°, a filtered solution of 360 g. (5 moles) of sodium nitrite in 700 cc. of water is dropped in slowly, through a long capillary tube reaching below the surface of the liquid, until a faint but permanent reaction to starch-potassium iodide paper is obtained; the temperature is kept between 3 and 5°. This operation requires all but about 30 cc. of the nitrite solution and occupies one and one-half to two hours.
The reaction mixture of two layers and some solid residue is heated under reflux for 4 hours. Upon cooling, two layers again appear. The product is extracted with two portions of ether (200 ml. each), and the extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate. Care should be taken since the α-bromolactone is a vesicant.
One mole (146 g.) of adipic acid (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 18), previously dried over sulfuric acid in a vacuum, is placed in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, and 357 g. (217 cc., 3 moles) of thionyl chloride is added at once. The mixture is heated gently on a water bath held at a temperature of 50–60°. After about four hours, solution is complete and evolution of hydrogen chloride has ceased. The flask is now connected to a downward condenser and heated under diminished pressure by a water bath to remove any excess thionyl chloride. The light yellow residue of adipyl chloride is ready for use.
A 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a 1.2- × 24-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column that is connected to a condenser, vacuum-take-off adapter, and fraction collector with three receiving flasks. The vacuum-take-off adapter is attached to a calcium chloride drying tube which is connected to a water aspirator, and the flask is charged with 35.2 g (28.6 mL, 0.40 mol) of pyruvic acid. The pyruvic acid is stirred at room temperature as 46.4 g (36.1 mL, 0.40 mol) of α,α-dichloromethyl methyl ether is added slowly over 30 min. Evolution of hydrogen chloride begins after a few minutes. When the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is removed and replaced by a glass stopper. The solution is stirred and heated at 50°C in an oil bath for 30 min while a few drops of methyl formate are collected as the first fraction. The condenser is then cooled to −30°C and the receiving flasks are cooled to −50°C with chilled acetone. The aspirator is turned on and the pressure is adjusted to 190 mm. With the oil bath at 50°C, a second fraction, bp 25–35°C (190 mm), is collected. As soon as the head temperature begins to drop, the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the temperature of the oil bath is raised slowly to 75°C. A third fraction, bp 35–40°C (120 mm), consisting mainly of pyruvoyl chloride is collected and. The second and third fractions are combined to give 33–41 g of a mixture of pyruvoyl chloride and methyl formate, which is redistilled through a 1.4- by 18-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. The condenser and the receiving flasks are cooled to −5°C with chilled acetone. The first fraction, weighing 2.3–11.4 g and consisting mainly of methyl formate, is collected at 25–30°C (190 mm) with an oil bath temperature of 60°C. When the pressure is reduced to 120 mm and the oil bath is maintained at 60°C, 18.6–21.2 g (44–50%) of pyruvoyl chloride, bp 43–45°C (120 mm), distills into the receiver as a light yellow liquid, nD20 1.4165 and.
One hundred and thirty-seven grams (1 mole) of anthranilic acid is dissolved, with the aid of gentle warming, in a mixture of 1 l. of water and 126 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The solution is filtered into a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a gas-tight, mechanically driven Hershberg stirrer. Through one of the side necks extends an inlet tube which ends in a coarse sintered-glass gas-dispersing tip extending well into the liquid into the liquid in the flask. The inlet tube is connected with a cylinder of phosgene through an empty safety flask. In the third neck of the flask is mounted an addition tube, through the vertical arm of which a thermometer is mounted so that the bulb is immersed in the reaction liquid. The outlet is attached to the lateral arm of the addition tube and is connected to an empty safety flask which in turn is connected to a Drechsel bottle charged with ammonium hydroxide.
If a purer product is desired, the amino acid is dissolved in 16 times its weight of boiling water, and to the solution is added absolute ethanol (46 ml. per g. of acid). The solution is stirred mechanically while it is cooled in an ice-water mixture. After 3 hours, the snow-white crystals are collected on a Büchner funnel and are washed with 300 ml. of 95% ethanol, in small portions, and dried as before. The recovery of amino acid, melting at 221° with decomposition, is 81%.
D. O-Trimethylsilylquinidine ( 4 , O-TMS QND) .3 A 250-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer (PTFE stirrer blade 1.9 × 6 cm) is flame-dried with a stream of nitrogen and left to cool down to ambient temperature for 10 min. To the flask are added quinidine (4.00 g, 12.4 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and CH2Cl2 (100 mL) followed by distilled trimethylsilyl chloride (1.9 mL, 15 mmol, 1.2 equiv), which is added slowly via syringe pump over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred at ambient temperature for 24 h and then transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, to which was added CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and NaHCO3 (aq) (100 mL). After shaking, the layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is reextracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 °C). The residue is then left to dry under reduced pressure at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h at 23 °C to afford 4.02 g (82%) of O-trimethylsilylquinidine (4) as a clear oil, which was of sufficient purity for use without purification.
To 136 g. (1 mole) of finely powdered aminoguanidine bicarbonate in a 500-ml. two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer is added 48 g. (40 ml., 1.05 moles) of 98–100% formic acid. The foaming mixture is heated cautiously, with gentle rotation of the flask to avoid local overheating, until gas evolution ceases and the whole mass is dissolved. The solution of aminoguanidine formate is held at a temperature of 120° for 5 hours. After the solution is cooled, 500 ml. of 95% ethanol is added, the product is dissolved by heating, and the solution is filtered while hot. The product, obtained by evaporating the ethanol solution to dryness on the steam bath, and oven-drying at 100°, is 80–81.6 g. (95–97%) of colorless crystalline 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole melting at 152–156°. The 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole can be recrystallized from ethanol.
In a 12-l. flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and mercury seal, a reflux condenser and an inlet tube for the introduction of air, is placed a mixture of 4100 g. (16.4 moles) of crystalline copper sulfate, 4000 g. of technical pyridine and 1600 g. of water. This is heated on a steam bath with stirring until the copper sulfate is completely dissolved and then 1696 g. (8 moles) of benzoin (p. 94; unrecrystallized material is satisfactory) is added and heating and stirring continued for two hours. The reaction mixture becomes dark green in color and the melted benzil forms the upper layer. After cooling, the copper sulfate-pyridine solution is decanted and the benzil washed with water and then heated with 3–4 l. of 10 per cent hydrochloric acid. After cooling, the benzil is filtered, washed with water, dried and recrystallized from carbon tetrachloride (2 l. of solvent per kg. of benzil). By concentration of the mother liquors a certain amount of benzil is always obtained. The total yield is 1450 g. (86 per cent of the theoretical amount) of recrystallized material melting at 94–95°.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirrer are placed 150 ml. of methanol, 150 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, and the total yield of 4,4'-bis(acetamido)azobenzene. The mixture is heated under reflux for 1.5 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled and the violet solid collected on a Büchner funnel. The damp product is suspended in 500 ml. of water in a 1-l. beaker equipped with a stirrer, and the mixture is slowly neutralized by the addition of 2.5N sodium hydroxide. In the course of the neutralization, the salt dissolves and the free base separates. The 4,4'-diaminoazobenzene is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with water, and dried under reduced pressure. The yield of yellow product, m.p. 238–241° (dec.), is 11–12 g. The over-all yield from p-aminoacetanilide is 52–56%.
p-Acetotoluide is prepared by refluxing 214 g. (2 moles) of commercial p-toluidine with 800 cc. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask for two hours. The reflux condenser is replaced by a mechanical stirrer and the mixture is stirred and cooled to 45°. Part of the product may separate in small crystalline flakes. The mixture is thoroughly stirred and 325 g. (102 cc., 2.03 moles) of bromine is added slowly from a separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture is maintained at 50–55°. During the course of this addition, which requires about forty minutes, a precipitate may separate; this later dissolves. The mixture is stirred one-half hour after the bromine has been added, and is then poured in a thin stream with efficient stirring into 10 l. of cold water to which has been added 25 g. of sodium bisulfite.
A. 6-Trityl-β-d-glucose-1,2,3,4-tetraacetate. A mixture containing 120 g. (0.67 mole) of anhydrous glucose, 193.2 g. (0.7 mole) of trityl chloride, and 500 ml. of anhydrous pyridine [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 100 (1941)], is heated on the steam cone until solution is complete. Without cooling, 360 ml. of acetic anhydride is added in one portion. After standing for 12 hours, the reaction mixture is poured slowly into 10 l. of ice water, to which 500 ml. of acetic acid has been added, and the resulting mixture is vigorously stirred mechanically for 2 hours. The precipitate is filtered and is immediately stirred for a short time with 10 l. of ice water. The white, granular precipitate is filtered, washed well with cold water, and then air-dried. The dried solid is digested with 500 ml. of ether. The insoluble portion is dissolved in hot 95% ethanol (approximately 3 l.), and the solution is decolorized and filtered while hot. The filtrate, upon cooling, deposits fine needles of 6-trityl-β-d-glucose-1,2,3,4-tetraacetate of sufficient purity for further use. The yield at this point is about 169 g. (43%). Recrystallization from 95% ethanol gives the pure compound which melts at 166–166.5°. In pyridine, [α]19D is + 44.8°; [α]28D, +45.3°. The yield of purified material is 137 g. (35%).
A. Potassium salt of ethyl o-nitrophenylpyruvate. Anhydrous ether (300 ml.) is placed in a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a motor-driven stirrer (with seal), and a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube. Freshly cut potassium (39.1 g., 1.00 g. atom) is added. Caution! Follow the precautions for handling potassium described in an earlier volume.2
In a 500-cc. Pyrex flask, fitted with a cork which loosely carries a glass mechanical stirrer and a separatory funnel, are placed 90 g. (1 mole) of anhydrous oxalic acid (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 421) and 100 cc. (79 g., 2.5 moles) of methanol. Then, while the mixture is rapidly stirred, 35 cc. of pure concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly added through the separatory funnel. The mixture is heated, if necessary, nearly to boiling, then filtered as rapidly as possible through a 15-cm. filter paper placed in a slightly heated glass funnel, the filtrate being collected in a 500-cc. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask. The first flask is rinsed with 40 cc. of hot methanol, which is poured through the filter paper. After twenty-four hours at 15° the crystals are filtered with suction, sucked as dry as possible, pressed between filter paper, and air-dried for a few minutes. The filtrate, after cooling to about −10°, is filtered rapidly and the product dried as before. A total of 100–115 g. of material, slightly moist with sulfuric acid and melting at 50–52°, is obtained.
B. 4,5-Dihydro-2-[(1-phenylmethyl-2-propenyl)thio]thiazole. A dry, 100-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a thermometer, a rubber septum, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a mechanical stirrer. A positive pressure of nitrogen, applied either through an adapter inserted in the top of the funnel or through a needle inserted in the septum, is maintained throughout the reaction. A solution of 2.0 g. (0.012 mole) of the thiazole prepared in part A in 24 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is placed in the flask, stirred vigorously, and cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath. When the internal temperature reaches −55°, 6.0 ml. (0.013 mole) of a 2.1 M solution of n-butyllithium in n-hexane is added by syringe at a rate such that the temperature remains below −55°; approximately 5 minutes is required. After stirring for an additional 20 minutes at −55° to −60°, a solution of 2.15 g. (0.0125 mole) of benzyl bromide in 2 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added at a rate such that the temperature remains below −55°, which again requires approximately 5 minutes. The solution is stirred for another 50 minutes at −55° to −60°, allowed to warm to 0° over 30 minutes, and poured onto 70 ml. of ice water. The resulting mixture is extracted with three 25-ml. portions of ethyl acetate; the extracts are combined, washed with two 15-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
The first fraction consists mainly of water, a little ethyl acetate, and some ethyl oxomalonate which recombines with the water to form ethyl mesoxalate. When the pressure has dropped to 45 mm. and the temperature has risen to 110°, the receiver is changed. The main product, ethyl oxomalonate, now distils at 110–135°/45–50 mm. If the oxidation has been complete, very little residue is left. Redistillation gives a golden-yellow liquid boiling between 103–108°/15 mm. The yield is 160–165 g. (74–76 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, septum, and a connection to a combined vacuum/nitrogen line. The air in the flask is replaced by nitrogen by repeated evacuation and flushing with nitrogen, the pressure of which is maintained during the reaction at ca. 70 mm above atmospheric pressure with a mercury bubbler. Dry tetrahydrofuran (100 mL) and 38.4 mL (0.269 mol) of diisopropylamine are injected with syringes through the septum. The mixture is cooled to −78°C by means of a dry ice/acetone bath and treated with stirring with 165 mL (0.264 mol) of a 15% solution of butyllithium in hexane. The dry ice/acetone bath is replaced with an ice bath, and stirring is continued for 30 min. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, septum, and a connection to the combined vacuum/nitrogen line is charged with 40.0 g (0.120 mol) of (R)-(+)-2-hydroxy-1,2,2-triphenylethyl acetate [(R)-HYTRA].2 The air in the flask is replaced with nitrogen, and 400 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added via a cannula with 1.2 mm inside diameter, whereby the flask is slightly evacuated. The suspension is stirred at −78°C in a dry ice/acetone bath. The ice-cold solution of lithium diisopropylamide, prepared as described above, is added via a cannula under vigorous stirring, whereby the 2-L flask is slightly evacuated. The reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for 60 min to complete the double deprotonation. A clear orange solution forms that is cooled, below −70°C (dry ice/acetone bath). Thereafter, 900 mL of dry 2-methylbutane is added via a cannula. A thermocouple, connected to a resistance thermometer, is introduced via the septum. The reaction flask is plunged into a bath of liquid nitrogen, the depth of immersion being 0.5–1 cm. When the temperature of the suspension has reached −128°C, a solution of 18.3 mL (0.200 mol) of 2-methylpropanal in 5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise via syringe through the septum at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above −126°C. Stirring is continued for 90 min at −128°C to −106°C. The mixture is treated with 500 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and allowed to reach room temperature.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a tube leading to a gas trap to carry off the hydrogen bromide, 278 g. (2 moles) of p-nitrophenol (m.p. 112–113°) is dissolved in 830 cc. of glacial acetic acid. To this solution at room temperature is added, dropwise with stirring during the course of three hours, a solution of 750 g. (240 cc., 4.7 moles) of bromine in 700 cc. of glacial acetic acid. After the addition of the bromine the reaction mixture is stirred for one-half hour and then warmed on the steam bath (internal temperature about 85°) for one hour in order to remove as much of the excess bromine as possible. The last traces of bromine are removed by passing a stream of air into the reaction mixture, which then has a yellow or brown color. The mixture is treated with 1.1 l. of cold water, stirred until cool, and allowed to stand in ice, or in an ice chest, overnight. The pale yellow crystalline product is collected on a 19-cm. Büchner funnel and washed first with 500 cc. of 50 per cent aqueous acetic acid and then thoroughly with water. It is dried in an oven at 40–60° or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide. The yield is 570–583 g. (96–98 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a nearly colorless product melting with decomposition at 138–140°.
B. Recovery of (−)-DAG. The basic aqueous solution (about 186 ml.), obtained after removal of the (−)-amine by ether extraction, is placed in a 600-ml. beaker and cooled to 0–5° with an ice bath. The solution is magnetically stirred and carefully acidified with 2 N hydrochloric acid at 0–5° to approximately pH 2. The precipitated (−)-DAG is filtered without delay, washed with 20 ml. of ice water, and air dried to constant weight, yielding 20.0–20.9 g. (91–94%, yield based on the amount of the salt used) of (−)-DAG, m.p. 103° (dec.), [α]D25 −21.6° (c 2.28%, methanol) and.
Determination of the yield of propellane. Wiberg and Waddell have shown that propellane reacts spontaneously in normal room light with thiophenol to yield bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide in 98% yield.2 A slight modification of their method provides a good estimate of the yield of propellane. Thus, a 3.0-mL portion of the propellane solution is transferred via a gas-tight syringe to a tared, flame-dried, argon-purged, 10-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and maintained under a static atmosphere of argon. Thiophenol is added in slight excess via syringe and the mixture is stirred under room light for 15 min. Concentration of the solution provides a mixture of thiophenol and bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide. The ratio of compounds may be determined by 1H NMR or GLC, and the yield of propellane calculated. Alternatively, the mixture may be diluted with pentane, washed with 1 M sodium hydroxide, dried with magnesium sulfate, and concentrated to provide bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl phenyl sulfide from which the yield of propellane is calculated. The reaction of thiophenol with propellane is assumed to be quantitative; thus yields for bicyclo[1.1.1]pentyl sulfide are 75 to 88% based on 1.
A. Oxodiperoxymolybdenum(aqua)(hexamethylphosphoric triamide), MoO5·H2O·HMPA.2 A 500-mL, three-necked flask is fitted with an internal thermometer and a mechanical paddle stirrer. The flask is charged, with stirring, with 30 g (0.2 mol) of molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and 150 mL of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). An oil bath equilibrated at 40°C is placed under the rection mixture and heating is continued until the internal temperature reaches 35°C. The heating bath is removed and replaced by a water bath to control the mildly exothermic reaction so that an internal temperature of 35–40°C is maintained. After the initial exothermic period (approximately 30 min), the reaction flask is placed in the 40°C oil bath and stirred a total of 3.5 hr to form a yellow solution with a small amount of suspended white solid.
A dry 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a 500-ml. dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser attached to a calcium chloride tube. In the flask are placed 29.1 g. (1.2 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings, a crystal of iodine, and about 50 ml. of dry ether. A solution of 229 g. (1.2 moles) of m-bromochlorobenzene in 850 ml. of dry ether is added with stirring at a rate which maintains rapid refluxing. The reaction begins after 20–50 ml. of the ether solution is added, and the addition requires 1–3 hours. The mixture is stirred and heated on the steam bath under reflux for 1 hour after all the m-bromochlorobenzene has been added.
The 213 g. (0.8 mole) of finely powdered silver salt is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask; two necks of the flask are stoppered, and the third is connected to a water pump through a U-tube or flask containing Drierite. The flask is then placed in an oil bath and evacuated to a pressure of about 15 mm. The temperature of the oil bath is maintained at 100–110° for 36 hours and.
A. Ethyl mandelate. To 152 g. (1.0 mole) of mandelic acid and 200 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, there is added 100 ml. of absolute ethanol containing about 10 g. of anhydrous hydrogen chloride. The solution is heated under reflux on a steam bath for 5 hours, then poured into 1 l. of ice water in a 3-l. beaker. A saturated aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate is added until the mixture is faintly alkaline. It is then extracted with two 300-ml. portions of ether in a 2-l. separatory funnel. The ether extracts are washed with a 200-ml. portion of water and dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The dried ether solution is concentrated by distillation from a 250-ml. Claisen flask, and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure. There is obtained 147–154 g. (82–86%) of ethyl mandelate, b.p. 144–145°/16 mm. The ester may crystallize upon standing for a prolonged period. It melts at 30.5–31.5°.
B. 2-Bromo-2-cyclopentenone ethylene ketal. A solution of 22.00 g (136.7 mmol) of freshly distilled 2-bromo-2-cyclopentenone, 21.80 g (351.2 mmol) of ethylene glycol, 1.5 L of benzene, and 60 mg of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is heated at reflux for 64 hr, with azeotropic removal of water, in a 3-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Dean-Stark trap, condenser, and Drierite drying tube. The solution is cooled to room temperature, dried with potassium carbonate, and filtered by vacuum through 15 g of Celite. The filtercake is washed with 150 mL of benzene. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure yields a mobile yellow oil. Distillation (65–67°C, 0.7 mm) affords 22.4 g (109.0 mmol, 80%) of the ketal.
Sodium is now added in small pieces; the solution is allowed to decolorize before each successive piece is added. A water bath is placed occasionally under the flask to ensure continuous ebullition of ammonia. The blue color will persist for at least 15 minutes after 1.6 g. (0.070 g. atom) of sodium has been added. The excess sodium is then destroyed by cautious addition of 6 g. (0.11 mole) of ammonium chloride, with stirring. Cooling and stirring are stopped, and a slow stream of argon is passed in for a period of about 12–15 hours. The white solid residue is transferred to a beaker, and 300 g. of ice water is added, together with sufficient pellets of sodium hydroxide to make the solution alkaline. The alkaline solution is then extracted twice with ether and the ether extracts discarded. The solution is then acidified to Congo red with cold 1:1 (by volume) hydrochloric acid and extracted three times with ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is evaporated and the 1,2-dimercaptobenzene is distilled under reduced pressure under an atmosphere of nitrogen, giving a product which boils at 95°/5 mm. and usually solidifies after distillation. The yield is 1.6–2.4 g. (56–85%).
(B) Biacetyl Monoxime.—In a 2-l. three-necked flask provided with a condenser, a thermometer, and an inlet tube for ethyl nitrite, and arranged for external cooling, is placed 620 g. of commercial methyl ethyl ketone which has been dried with, and filtered from, 75 g. of anhydrous copper sulfate. Forty cubic centimeters of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added and the temperature raised to 40°. The ethyl nitrite from the preceding preparation is now bubbled in, the temperature being maintained between 40° and 55°. After all the ethyl nitrite has been passed in the crude product may be used in the preparation of dimethylglyoxime by distilling off the alcohol formed in the reaction until the temperature of the liquid reaches 90°.
The aqueous layers containing the silver(I) complex of methyl (1R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-acetate are then treated with an excess of saturated brine to precipitate silver chloride and free the desired product. After precipitation is complete, the water layer is decanted from the solid silver chloride. The solids are washed with ether (4 × 100 mL) and each ether layer is used to extract the water layer. The combined ether layers are washed with 50 mL of brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Filtration and removal of solvent under reduced pressure yield 16–19 g of crude product. The product is distilled through a 4-in.-Vigreux column at 0.1 mm pressure to yield 12.8–14.7 g (27–31%) of methyl (1R,5R)-5-hydroxy-2-cyclopentene-1-acetate, bp 74–78°C at 0.1 mm, [α]D25 −132° (CH3OH, c 1.06) and.

The flask is cooled at 0°C in an ice–salt bath, and a mixture containing 15.5 g (2.65 mol) of sodium chloride in 1.2 L of aqueous 5.25% sodium hypochlorite solution is added with vigorous stirring over a 15-min period using the dropping funnel. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 15 min. At this time the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 75-mL portions of ether. The ethereal extracts are combined with the organic phase and the mixture is washed successively four times with 125-mL portions of water and once with a 125-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The mixture is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated to a volume of approximately 75 mL at 25°C under aspirator vacuum. The mixture is filtered through a 3-cm × 14-cm column of silica gel and eluted with 200 mL of anhydrous benzene into a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask. Concentration under reduced pressure at room temperature to a volume of approximately 50 mL yields a yellow solution. The flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, heating mantle, and reflux condenser protected from the atmosphere by a calcium chloride drying tube and then charged with 600 mL of anhydrous benzene and 7.49 g (0.0634 mol) of trans-β-methylstyrene.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled condenser, 50 g. (0.23 mole) of N-phenylanthranilic acid (or 46 g. of acridone) is mixed with 160 ml. (270 g., 1.76 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride. The mixture is slowly heated (about 15 minutes) to 85–90° on a water bath. A vigorous reaction sets in, and the flask is removed at once from the hot bath. If the reaction becomes too violent, the flask is immersed in a beaker of cold water for a moment. After 5–10 minutes, when the boiling subsides somewhat, the flask is immersed in an oil bath. The temperature of the bath is then raised to 135–140°, where it is maintained for 2 hours. The excess phosphorus oxychloride is removed by distillation from an oil bath at 140–150° under a vacuum of about 50 mm. The residue, after cooling, is poured into a well-stirred mixture of 200 ml. of concentrated ammonia solution, 500 g. of ice, and 200 ml. of chloroform. The flask is rinsed by shaking with a little chloroform-ammonia mixture (about 25–30 ml.). When no more undissolved solid remains (about 30 minutes is required), the chloroform layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with an additional 40 ml. of chloroform. The united chloroform extracts are dried over 10 g. of calcium chloride and filtered, and the solvent is removed by distillation. The resultant greenish gray powder is dried at 70° for 20 minutes and. The yield of crude 9-chloroacridine is 50 g. (practically theoretical), m.p. 117–118°.
For the purification of the p-iodoaniline, the crude product is placed in a 2-l. flask and 1 l. of gasoline is added. The flask is fitted with an air-cooled reflux condenser and heated in a water bath at a temperature of 75–80°. The flask should be shaken frequently, and about fifteen minutes should be allowed for saturation of the solution. The hot gasoline solution is slowly decanted into a beaker set in an ice-salt mixture and stirred constantly. The p-iodoaniline crystallizes immediately in practically colorless needles which are filtered and dried in the air and. The filtrate is returned to the flask for use in a second extraction. The yield is 165–185 g. (75–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 62–63°.

The system is cooled to −40°C and magnetic stirring is initiated. The mixture is stirred for 30 min at −40°C, then 2-nitroethanol (3.00 mL, 41.8 mmol, Note 9) is added via syringe over 4 min. After 30 min of stirring at −40°C, 5.00 mL of 3-phenylpropanal (38.0 mmol, Note 10) is added via syringe over 5 min and the resulting solution is stirred for 90 hr. The reaction is monitored by TLC. To the reaction mixture is added 150 mL of 1N hydrochloric acid (HCl). To this mixture is added 20 g of sodium chloride (NaCl) and the resulting mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with ethyl acetate (400, 200, and 200 mL) and the combined organic phases are washed with 350 mL of aqueous saturated NaCl solution and dried over sodium sulfate . The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting crude product is recrystallized from 1 : 1 hexane: ether (ca. 200 mL) to give 4.31g (50%) of analytically pure (2S,3S)-2-nitro-5-phenyl-1,3-pentanediol (98% ee, Notes 12-15).

A solution of 19.5 g. (0.1 mole) of ethyl p-nitrobenzoate in 150 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is placed in the reaction bottle of the catalytic reduction apparatus (p. 61), and 0.2 g. of platinum oxide catalyst (p. 463) is added. The mixture is shaken with hydrogen until three molecular equivalents have been absorbed. The time required is about seven minutes. The platinum is filtered off and the alcohol removed from the filtrate by distillation. The ethyl p-aminobenzoate, recrystallized from about 40 cc. of ether, melts at 89–90°. The yield is 15–16.5 g. (91–100 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Dry hydrogen chloride (p. 293), is passed into 200 g. (251 cc., 6.2 moles) of anhydrous methyl alcohol, with ice cooling and exclusion of moisture, until the increase in weight amounts to 5 g. This solution is then diluted with 1800 g. of methyl alcohol, a 0.25 per cent solution of hydrogen chloride being thus obtained. To this is added 500 g. (2.77 moles) of finely powdered anhydrous d-glucose, and the mixture boiled under reflux for seventy-two hours, a clear solution being obtained after the first fifteen minutes' boiling. It is well to attach a soda-lime tube to the upper end of the condenser, in order to exclude moisture. The clear pale yellow solution is cooled to 0°, and crystallization induced by scratching or by inoculation with a trace of α-methyl d-glucoside. After twelve hours at 0° the first crop is filtered by suction and washed twice with 100-cc. portions of cold methyl alcohol. The yield is 85–120 g. of a product melting at 165°.

Sodium metal (1.4 g, 0.06 mol) is then added in small portions. After all of the sodium has reacted, p-toluidine (6.4 g, 0.06 mol) is added and the resulting solution is stirred for 5 min. The iminium salt (10.6 g, 0.065 mol) produced in Step A is added in one portion and the resulting mixture is refluxed with stirring overnight. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue is taken up in chloroform (100 mL) and extracted twice with a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium bicarbonate (2 × 30 mL). The chloroform phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual dark-brown liquid is distilled using a Kugelrohr apparatus; the major fraction boils at 85–100°C (oven temperature), 0.4 mm, and yields 9.1–9.2 g (94–95%) of a pale-yellow liquid and.

The mixture is lowered into an oil bath, preheated to 135°C, and is stirred until dissolution is achieved (ca. 5 min). The distillation receiver is cooled in an ice bath, and ca. 120 mL of ethanol is collected from the reaction over a 2.5-hr period. The oil bath is removed on cessation of the ethanol distillation. After the light-yellow solution is cooled to ambient temperature, it is diluted with 750 mL of dichloromethane, transferred to a separatory funnel, and washed with 750 mL of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator affording 200 g (113%) of a white crystalline solid. This material is taken up into 600 mL of a hot 2:1 ethyl acetate–hexane solution, filtered while hot, then allowed to crystallize to afford 136–138 g (78–79%) of large white plates, mp 84.5–86.5°C and.

The resulting solution is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel and washed with 1.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl, 100 mL) followed by 5% sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution (100 mL). The aqueous washes are separately extracted with diethyl ether (30 mL each). The ether layers are combined and washed with saturated sodium chloride solution (100 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , filtered, and the filtrate concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil. The oil is filtered through silica (200 mL) with hexanes (500 mL) followed by diethyl ether (400 mL) on a 4-cm φ column. Fractions of eluent (20 mL) are collected and those containing the product as determined by TLC are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil that is distilled under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) to give 5.77 g (83% yield) of (R)-3-phenylcyclohexanone (1) as a colorless oil. The enantiomeric purity is 98.6% ee, which is determined by HPLC analysis using a chiral stationary phase column.
Shortly after the addition is complete, a voluminous white precipitate appears, and the resulting slurry is stirred and maintained at −50° to −40° for 4 hours. Cooling and stirring are continued as 18 g. (25 ml., 0.18 mole) of triethylamine is added dropwise, during which time the reaction mixture first goes to a clear solution, then becomes cloudy.

A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 10 g (0.085 mol) of methyl 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, 17.7 g (0.102 mol) of S-tert-butyl 3-oxobutanthioate, and 250 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The flask is placed in the dark and 22.5 g (0.102 mol) of freshly prepared silver(I) trifluoroacetate is added in two portions. The resulting dark-brown suspension is stirred for 15 min and then concentrated to approximately 50 mL with a rotary evaporator. The concentrated mixture is diluted with 200 mL of hexane and the resulting orange-brown precipitate is removed by filtration. The filtered solid is washed with two 50-mL portions of hexane and the combined filtrate and washings concentrated with a rotary evaporator to give an orange-brown oil.

A flame-dried, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (500 mL) is equipped with a mechanical or magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, water condenser connected to a nitrogen inlet, and a septum, and then charged with zinc (Zn) powder (13.1 g, 0.2 mol) and anhydrous acetonitrile (50 mL) under an atmosphere of nitrogen. The zinc powder is activated by the addition of 1,2-dibromoethane (1.5 mL, 3.5 g, 0.02 mol) via syringe followed by warming the mixture at reflux for 1 min and then allowing the mixture to cool to room temperature. A small amount of chlorotrimethylsilane (Me3SiCl) is added via syringe, whereupon evolution of ethylene gas is observed. The mixture is stirred for 45 min, and then N-methylbenzimine (23.8 g, 0.2 mol) is added in one portion via syringe, followed by anhydrous acetonitrile (100 mL). The septum is replaced with an addition funnel (100 mL), and chlorotrimethylsilane (32.5 g, 38 mL, 0.3 mol) is slowly added (30 min) at a rate that maintains the internal temperature below 30°C. The reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr and then cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. The vigorously stirred mixture is hydrolyzed by cautiously adding, via the addition funnel, a solution prepared by mixing concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide (60 mL) with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride (140 mL). The excess zinc is removed by filtration at 1 atm, washed with ether (200 mL), and the residual zinc is covered with water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (1 × 200 mL) and dichloromethane (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over anhydrous K2CO3. The salts are removed by filtration, washed with diethyl ether (50 mL), and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford 24.3 g of a semi-solid residue that is used directly in the next reaction and.
After all the phosphine has been added, the water bath is replaced by a heating mantle, and the reaction mixture is held at 85–95° for one additional hour and cooled to room temperature. The nitrogen-inlet tube, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser are removed, and the reaction flask is fitted with a 15 × 150-mm. Vigreux column for distillation under reduced pressure. The reaction mixture is then distilled. The pot temperature rises from 94° to 150° during the distillation, and the crude N,N-diethyl-1,2,2-trichlorovinylamine, weight 151–164 g., is collected at 73–120°/8–11 mm. Redistillation of the crude vinylamine through a 20 × 400-mm. column packed with glass helices affords 140–150 g. (69–74%) of pure N,N-diethyl-1,2,2-trichlorovinylamine, b.p. 78–79°/18 mm., nD25 1.4857–1.4867 and.
To this stirred suspension, 73.6 g (0.48 mol) of freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride is added dropwise, whereupon the temperature rises to about 80°C, most of the binaphthol dissolves, and pyridine hydrochloride crystals form. Complete dissolution is achieved by heating to 90°C. The stirred solution is allowed to cool to 50–60°C. (Crystallization occurs at about 85°C.) To the stirred suspension, 40 mL of water is added dropwise (Caution! Exothermic reaction!), which raises the temperature to the boiling point (ca. 118°C). The resulting solution, cooled to about 60°C, is transferred to a l-L dropping funnel and the flask is rinsed with pyridine (2 × 20 mL). The solution and rinse are combined and added dropwise with vigorous stirring to 900 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid, which gives a precipitate of pyridine-solvated binaphthylphosphoric (BNP) acid. This crude product is collected by suction filtration. The wet cake is transferred to a 2-L, large-necked flask and stirred with 300 mL of 6 N hydrochloric acid. The suspension is heated to boiling (possible foaming!) and immediately cooled. The solid is thoroughly filtered by suction, washed twice with 20 mL of water, and air-dried to afford 114–119 g (94–99%) of (±)-binaphthylphosphoric acid. This compound, which decomposes without melting at about 300°C, is pure enough to be resolved. Analytical crystalline samples can be obtained from ethanol.

A 100-mL, flame-dried, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum and nitrogen bubbler is charged with 1.84 g (22.44 mmol) of 1-hexyne and 50 mL of dry THF. The stirred solution is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath at −78°C and 20.4 mL (22.44 mmol) of 1.1 M butyllithium (BuLi) is added via syringe. The resulting solution is stirred for 20 min. This solution is transferred via cannula to a solution of 2.58 g (18.70 mmol) of 2-ethenyl-3-methoxycyclobutendione in 350 mL of dry THF in a dry ice-acetone bath. The resulting solution is stirred for 60 min and then quenched with 100 mL of aqueous 10% NH4Cl. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 50 mL), and the combined organic layers are washed with brine (150 mL), dried (MgSO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude cyclobutenone is dissolved in 350 mL of freshly distilled acetonitrile (CH3CN) and refluxed for 1.5 hr. The CH3CN is then removed under reduced pressure. The resulting red oil is purified by flash chromatography (SiO2, 110 g) eluting with ethyl acetate:hexanes (1:10) to yield 2.01 g (49% from cyclobutendione 2 ) of 3 as a red oil.
The product is collected on a suction filter. The yield of air-dried product, as yellow-orange crystals, m.p. 87–89°, is 38–42 g. (65–71%). A purer, lemon-yellow product, m.p. 88.5–90°, is obtained by an additional recrystallization from 1 l. of petroleum ether (b.p. 90–100°) with use of carbon; the yield after this second crystallization is 28–34 g. (48–58%).

(0.0100 mole) of 4-acetoxybenzoic acid. A magnetic stirring bar is added, and the solution is stirred while 1.4 g. (1.9 ml., 0.011 mole) of diisopropylethylamine is introduced with a syringe. The flask is then stoppered and allowed to stand at room temperature for 16–24 hours.
An oven-dried 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a septum, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is maintained under an inert atmosphere of argon and charged with 4-benzoyloxy-morpholine (5.18 g, 25 mmol), copper(II) chloride (0.084 g, 0.625 mmol), and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL). The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice-bath. The previously generated diphenylzinc solution is added via cannula over the course of 5–10 min at a rate such that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The resulting light brown solution is stirred for 1.5 h in the ice-bath. Diethyl ether (250 mL) is added and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The reaction mixture is washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution (3 × 200 mL), brine (1 × 100 mL), and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The resulting yellow oil is dissolved in diethyl ether (100 mL) and the solution is extracted with 10 % aqueous HCl solution (3 × 50 mL). The aqueous extracts are basified with 10 % aqueous NaOH solution (200 mL) and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL). The organic fraction is washed with 150-mL of brine, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to yield 2.73 g (67%) of 4-phenylmorpholine as an off-white, crystalline solid.
A 500-ml., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a low-temperature thermometer, and a calcium chloride tube is charged with 250 ml. of dry diethyl ether. With an acetone–dry ice bath the temperature of the ether is lowered to −10 to −15° and maintained within this range while a slow stream of hydrogen chloride is introduced, with slow stirring, for about 45 minutes. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a glass stopper, and 10.0 g. (0.0259 mole) of cholestan-3-one is added while the temperature of the stirred solution is kept below −15°. The reaction mixture is cooled to −20°, and 12.3 g. (0.188 g.-atom) of activated zinc is added over a 2–3 minute period. The temperature of the reaction mixture is allowed to rise to −5°, and it is maintained between −4° and 0° for 2 hours. Stirring is not interrupted for the duration of the reaction. The mixture is finally cooled to −15° and poured slowly onto about 130 g. of crushed ice. The ethereal layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of ether that had been used to rinse the reaction vessel. The ethereal solutions are combined, washed with saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The ether is distilled under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath, leaving 9.3–9.5 g. of a colorless, liquid residue that solidifies on cooling. This solid is dissolved in 30–40 ml. of n-hexane. The solution is poured onto a 3.5 cm. by 17 cm. column of silica gel and eluted with 80–90 ml. of n-hexane. Distillation of the solvent under reduced pressure with a 50° water bath leaves 8.0–8.2 g. (82–84%) of cholestane, which, after recrystallization from ethanol-ether, yields 7.3–7.5 g. (76–77%) of product as plates m.p. 78–79° (lit., m.p. 80°)3.

The mixture is stirred and heated to reflux employing a bath temperature of ≈130°C for 3 hr. Within 30 min all of the material dissolves, then the product begins to crystallize. At the end of the reflux period the mixture is cooled to ≈30°C and 800 ml of diethyl ether is added over 10 min. The slurry is stirred for 20 min, filtered through a coarse sintered glass, fritted funnel, washed with 250 ml of diethyl ether and dried at 50°C under vacuum overnight to afford 144.4 g (235 mmol, 88%) of N-(9-anthracenylmethyl)cinchonidinium chloride as a crystalline, light yellow solid, which is sufficiently pure for use in the next step.
The 420–460 g. of crude nicotinic acid nitrate from two runs (not necessarily dry) is dissolved in 900 cc. of boiling water in a 3-l. beaker, and 800 g. of crystalline disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4 · 12H2O) is added with constant stirring. The resulting thick mixture is stirred and heated almost to boiling for five minutes and then allowed to cool. The mixture is finally chilled to 0° by an ice bath. It is well to stir occasionally during the crystallization to prevent the formation of too solid a cake of crystalline material. The nicotinic acid is filtered off upon a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with three 100-cc. portions of cold water.
The solution is evaporated by boiling to a volume of about 400 cc., and 600 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol is added. When thoroughly cooled, 100–120 g. of alanine is filtered off. This is washed with 200 cc. of alcohol and a pure white product is obtained.
When all the bromine has been added, the flask is cooled in ice-water and the product filtered with suction. The crude crystals are washed with 50 per cent ethyl alcohol until colorless (about 100 cc. is required). The material so obtained, when air-dried, melts at 106–108° and weighs 55–60 g. It is recrystallized from 400 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, from which it separates as colorless needles melting at 108–109°. The yield is 48–50 g. (69–72 per cent of the theoretical amount).
For purification, 200 g. of the crude product is suspended in 1 l. of hot water and treated with a solution of 88 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 cc. of water. The solution is stirred mechanically and the isatin passes into solution. Dilute hydrochloric acid is then added, with stirring, until a slight precipitate appears. This requires about 290–300 cc. of an acid made by diluting one volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) with two volumes of water. The mixture is then filtered at once, the precipitate is rejected, and the filtrate is made acid to Congo red paper with hydrochloric acid. The solution is then cooled rapidly, and the isatin which separates is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The pure product thus obtained weighs 150–170 g. and and melts at 197–200° (corr.).

A 500-mL two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a glass stopper and a gas inlet connected to the argon/vacuum manifold is flame-dried under vacuum and back-filled with argon. The flask is then charged with [MoCl3(THF)3] 3 (7.96 g, 19.0 mmol) by removing a stopper and adding the solid, followed by Et2O (300 mL), which is transferred by syringe. The resulting suspension is cooled to −30 °C with an acetone/dry ice bath before anilide 2 (9.79 g, 38.0 mmol) is added through removal of the stopper. The resulting mixture is stirred for 3 h during which time it is allowed to reach room temperature and the solution turns dark red. The suspension is filtered under argon into a flame-dried 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask to remove LiCl; the solid is rinsed with ether (15 mL). With one neck equipped with a rubber septum and the other one connected via a cold-trap to the vacuum line, the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure (7.5 mmHg) to approximately 1/6 of its original volume (50 mL). The remaining solution is cooled to - 30 °C for 16 h, causing the separation of dark red crystals. The supernatant liquid is decanted off while keeping a positive argon pressure, and the remaining dark-red, crystalline molybdenum trisamide 4 is dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) (4.28 g, 55%).
When the mixture ceases to maintain its temperature spontaneously at 95–100°, heat is applied cautiously until the temperature reaches 110°. About 13 cc. of nitromethane and 200 cc. of water distil over. Further distillation gives water which contains too little nitromethane to pay for recovery. At this point enough sodium chloride and sodium carbonate have separated to cause serious bumping.
After cooling, the products are extracted from the reaction mixture with successive portions of water and ether. Extraction is facilitated by breaking up the solid material with a glass rod. The total amounts. of solvents required are approximately 750 ml. of water and 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether and water solutions are transferred to a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and steam-distilled with superheated steam maintained at 180–200°. After removal of the ether, 300 ml. of distillate is collected. This distillate contains the unreacted starting materials. Continued distillation gives 64–69 g. (62–67%) of crude solid 2-methoxydiphenyl ether in 14 l. of distillate. The product is filtered with suction and dried. Crystallization from a mixture of 600 ml. of low-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°) and 435 ml. of higher-boiling petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) yields 54–61 g. of 2-methoxydiphenyl ether melting at 77–78°. Other 2-methoxydiphenyl ethers have been prepared by this procedure.
A. [(Methyl)(methoxy)carbene]pentacarbonyl chromium(0).2 A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, 100-mL addition funnel, reflux condenser, and gas inlet is charged with 17.8 g (0.085 mol) of chromium hexacarbonyl. The apparatus is evacuated (oil pump) and filled with argon (four cycles), and a positive pressure is maintained with an argon-filled balloon on a T-tube. Dry diethyl ether (500 mL) is transferred via cannula into the flask and stirring is commenced. The addition funnel is charged with 60 mL (1.42 M in ether, 0.085 mol) of methyllithium via cannula and rapid dropwise addition is begun. The methyllithium is added over a 15-min period, during which time the solution turns from bright yellow to dark brown. The solution is heated at reflux for approximately 1.5 hr. After the solution is cooled, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation. The dark-brown residual solid is taken up in 80 mL of water (in air), and 13.0 g (0.088 mol) of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoroborate is added over a 30-min period with stirring. The mixture is extracted several times with 200-mL portions of cold pentane. The combined pentane layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered through a bed of Celite. The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation to approximately 60 mL and is cooled to −20°C under argon. After 1 hr the resulting bright-yellow crystals (17.6 g, 83%) are collected and dried at 25°C under reduced pressure for 10 min.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube, 11.5 g. (0.5 gram atom) of finely cut sodium is dissolved in 250 cc. of absolute alcohol. To this solution is added 80 g. (0.5 mole) of diethyl malonate followed by 30 g. (0.5 mole) of dry urea dissolved in 250 cc. of hot (70°) absolute alcohol. After being well shaken the mixture is refluxed for seven hours on an oil bath heated to 110°. A white solid separates rapidly. After the reaction is completed, 500 cc. of hot (50°) water is added and then enough hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) to make the solution acidic (about 45 cc.). The resulting clear solution is filtered and cooled in an ice bath overnight. The white product is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 50 cc. of cold water, and then dried in an oven at 105–110° for three to four hours. The yield of barbituric acid is 46–50 g. (72–78 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Disodium nitrosodisulfonate. A 1-l., resin kettle equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a gas-inlet tube suspended about 0.5 cm. above the bottom of the vessel, and an ice-cooling bath is charged with 15.0 g. (0.217 mole) of sodium nitrite, 16.8 g. (0.200 mole) of sodium hydrogen carbonate, and 400 g. of ice. Sulfur dioxide (25.6 g., 0.400 mole,) is passed into the cold, initially heterogeneous mixture with stirring over a period of 40 minutes. Near the end of the sulfur dioxide addition, the light brown color of the reaction mixture fades almost completely. The resulting colorless to pale-yellow solution of disodium hydroxylaminedisulfonate, which has an approximate pH of 4, is stirred for 10 minutes before 59.5 g. (0.480 mole) of sodium carbonate monohydrate is added, giving a solution of pH 11. The gas-inlet tube is removed from the reaction vessel and replaced with a rectangular anode constructed from a 3.5 cm. by 4.7 cm. piece of stainless-steel mesh (about 16 mesh/cm.2) with a stainless-steel wire as an electrical lead. The cathode is a cylindrical coil formed from a 1.5-mm. by 40-cm. piece of stainless-steel wire suspended in a 5-cm. by 10-cm. porous porcelain thimble filled with aqueous 10% sodium carbonate. The porcelain thimble containing the cathode is suspended in the reaction vessel so that the liquid levels in the anode and cathode compartments are the same. The cathode-anode resistance of the electrolysis cell should be in the range of 5–10 ohms. While the reaction solution is continuously stirred and maintained at a temperature of 12° with an ice bath, the electrolysis is started by applying a sufficient potential (approximately 10 volts,) to the anode and cathode leads, giving a cell current of 2.0 amp. As the electrolysis proceeds, the potential applied to the cell is adjusted to maintain a cell current of 2.0 amp. The formation of the nitrosodisulfonate radical is evidenced by the appearance of a deep purple color. The electrolysis is continued with stirring and cooling until quantitative measurement of the optical density of the reaction solution, indicates the concentration of disodium nitrosodisulfonate to be 0.42–0.47 M (84–94% yield). The typical reaction time is 4 hours; the amount of electricity passed through the cell totals approximately 28,800 coulombs or 8 amp-hours (theoretically, 19,300 coulombs or 5.4 amp-hours). This solution of the nitrosodisulfonate radical is removed from the anode compartment of the electrolysis cell and used directly in the next step.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 582 g. (2.5 moles) of N-tricarboxylic ester (p. 415) and 800 g. (6.7 moles) of 42% hydrazine hydrate. The flask is shaken by hand to mix the two layers. After a short time, reaction begins with considerable evolution of heat, and all the N-tricarboxylic ester goes into solution. After the reaction subsides, the solution is heated for 1 hour on a steam bath and then evaporated under reduced pressure until the mixture becomes a thick slurry of diaminobiuret crystals. The mixture is cooled, 2 l. of 95% ethanol is added, and the diaminobiuret which has crystallized is filtered, washed with 250 ml. of ethanol, and dried. The substance melts at 205° with decomposition. The yield is 115–125 g. (69–75%).
The cooling bath is then replaced with a steam bath, and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 16 hours. It is then cooled, transferred to a one-necked, 1-l., round-bottomed flask, and concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The dark residue is dissolved in a mixture of 200 ml. of water, 200 ml. of dichloromethane, and 20 ml. of triethylamine, and the aqueous phase is separated and washed with two 200-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined and washed with 300 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a red oil, which solidifies on storage at 0–5°. Recrystallization of this solid from 40 ml. of absolute ethanol gives 7.6–8.4 g. (34–37%) of ethyl 4-amino-3-(methylthiomethyl)benzoate, m.p. 83–85°. A second crop of 1.1–2.5 g. of crystalline material, m.p. 78–83°, may be obtained by concentration of the mother liquors.
The upper layer, which weighs 1280–1285 g., is separated and washed three times with 330 cc. portions of water. The weight has now fallen to 990–995 g. The oil is dried by standing over 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate and is then fractionally distilled with the use of an efficient column at least 90 cm. long, and the fraction which boils at 101–103.5° collected as pure acetal. In this way 700–720 g. can be obtained by one or two fractionations. The yield can be further increased by washing the low-boiling fractions and residue with small quantities of water, drying, and again fractionally distilling, so that a total of 790–815 g. is obtained (61–64 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The melt is cooled to 0°, 50 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution is added, and the mixture is extracted with four 50-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined chloroform extracts are washed with two 25-ml. portions of water, and these in turn are extracted with 10 ml. of chloroform. The organic layers are combined and dried partially over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation on the steam bath, and the residue is distilled at reduced pressure from a 50-ml. distilling flask. After a fore-run of about 4 g., b.p. 60–70°/1.5 mm. (bath temperature taken up to 125°), the cyanoethylaniline is collected at 115–120°/0.01 mm. The product solidifies in the form of colorless plates, m.p. 48–51°. The yield is 10.5–11.4 g. (72–78%).
Into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are introduced 100 g. (0.385 mole) of technical grade triphenylcarbinol, 105 g. (0.81 mole) of dry aniline hydrochloride, and 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid. The mixture is heated at the reflux temperature for 3 hours. During the period of reflux a clear brown homogeneous solution is formed. The solution while still hot is poured with stirring into a 4-l. beaker containing 2 l. of water. p-Aminotetraphenylmethane hydrochloride, which is not very soluble in water, separates as a light-brown solid. It is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 1 l. of water. The solid is then put back into the beaker, and a solution of 40 g. of sodium hydroxide in 2 l. of water is added. The mixture is heated to boiling for 1 hour to convert the hydrochloride to the free base, which likewise is not very soluble in water. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered with suction through a Büchner funnel. The solid material is washed with 500 ml. of water and is dried in an oven at 110–120°. The crude substance melts at 243–247°. It is purified by crystallization from 1.7 l. of toluene. The purified product (90–95 g., 70–74%) melts at 249–250°.
Cyclopropenone prepared in this way is quite pure and suitable for most chemical purposes. It can be repurified by crystallization from 3 volumes of ethyl ether at −60° using a cooled filtering apparatus. The residual ethyl ether is then removed by evaporation at 1–2 mm. and 0°; very pure cyclopropenone is obtained in 60–70% recovery from the distilled material.
The bulk of the nitrobenzene comes over in about 1.5 hours, and the product then separates as a pasty mass which slowly disintegrates to a powder. During this process the elimination of nitrobenzene is very slow, but the steaming should be continued until only a few small lumps remain (4–5 hours), although it is not necessary to remove every trace of solvent. The mixture is cooled with tap water, the crude acid is filtered and returned to the flask, and 115 g. of sodium carbonate decahydrate is added, together with sufficient water to make the flask a little less than half full. The mixture is heated with shaking over a free flame until most of the solid has dissolved and the frothing has diminished. A few drops of capryl alcohol may be added to dissipate the froth. The dark brown solution is steam-distilled to eliminate the last traces of nitrobenzene (about 30 minutes) and then filtered by suction from a very light residue. One hundred grams of sodium chloride is dissolved in the hot solution (volume, about 1.5 l.), which is then allowed to cool without disturbance. The sodium salt of β-(3-acenaphthoyl) propionic acid separates as colorless, fibrous needles, while the isomeric 1-acid largely remains in solution. The product is collected on a large Büchner funnel and washed free of the dark mother liquor with half-saturated sodium chloride solution (about 150 ml.), the combined filtrates (A) being set aside. The sodium salt is crystallized once more from boiling water (1–1.5 l.), using Norit if required, and adding 50 g. of sodium chloride to the hot filtered solution. The mother liquor (B) is again saved. The purified salt is dissolved in 1.2 l. of hot water and the solution is acidified. The free acid separates as a white powder in a very pure condition. The yield of β-(3-acenaphthoyl) propionic acid melting at 206–208° with decomposition is 133 g. (81%).
C. 3,3-Dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-ol. A 25-mL test tube is charged with 0.3–0.4 g (0.6–0.8 mmol) of bis(copper trifluoromethanesulfonate)benzene complex and sealed with a rubber septum under an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. A solution of 5 mL (4.3 g, 0.031 mol) of 4,4-dimethyl-1,6-heptadien-3-ol in 10 mL of ether is added by means of a syringe. The resulting solution is poured into a nitrogen-flushed Pyrex 250-mL annular reactor fitted with a magnetic stirrer, an internal concentric water-jacketed quartz immersion well, and a water-cooled reflux condenser topped with a gas inlet for maintaining an atmosphere of dry nitrogen. An additional 20 mL (17.4 g, 0.124 mol) of the hydroxydiene 2 in 200 mL of dry ether is added. The resulting solution is stirred and irradiated for 15 hr with a 450-W medium-pressure Hanovia mercury are that is suspended in the immersion well. At the end of that time an opaque film of copper is wiped from the immersion well, and irradiation is then continued for an additional 7 hr. The resulting solution is shaken in a separatory funnel with a mixture of 100 g of ice and 100 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The organic phases are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation using a rotary evaporator and the product is distilled through a 15-cm vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column to give 19.0–19.9 g (88–92% yield) of 3,3-dimethyl-cis-bicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-2-ol (3), bp 80–84°C (12 mm), nD25 1.4761–1.4783.
A 3-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, and Teflon-coated thermocouple, is charged with (S)-diphenylprolinol sulfate (81.0 g, 0.268 mol), tetrahydrofuran (268 mL), and 2 M aqueous sodium hydroxide (268 mL). The mixture is stirred at 20–25°C until all the solid dissolves (0.5 hr). Toluene (1.1 L) is added and the mixture is aged 0.5 hr. The two-phase mixture is filtered through a medium frit sintered glass funnel and partitioned. The upper layer is washed with water (130 mL) and the toluene is removed under reduced pressure to afford a light-tan colored oil that crystallizes upon standing at ambient temperature. Recrystallization of the resulting light-tan crystals from heptane (ca. 2 mL of heptane per gram of prolinol) affords (S)-1,1-diphenylprolinol; [yield 64–68 g (94–99% yield based upon diphenylprolinol sulfate)] as white crystals, mp 76–78°C, >98% ee,(Note 20)).
The flask is cooled in an ice–salt bath to −5°C and a solution of 20 g (25 mL, 0.22 mol) of 2-methylpropane-2-thiol in 20 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added at such a rate as to maintain a steady evolution of hydrogen. The slightly exothermic reaction causes the temperature to rise to 0°C and the colorless solution is stirred at this temperature for 15 min to ensure complete formation of the thiolate. The reaction mixture is then recooled to −5°C and 20.3 g (18.8 mL, 0.24 mol) of diketene is added over 15 min to give a yellow-green solution. The cooling bath is removed and the solution allowed to warm to room temperature.
A. o-Nitrobenzaldiacetate. In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an effective mechanical stirrer and a thermometer, and surrounded by an ice bath, are placed 600 g. (570 ml.) of glacial acetic acid, 565 ml. (612 g., 6 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 50 g. (0.36 mole) of o-nitrotoluene. To this solution is added slowly, with stirring, 156 g. (85 ml., 1.5 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid. When the mixture has cooled to 5°, 100 g. (1 mole) of chromium trioxide is added in small portions at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 10°; about 2 hours is required for the addition. Stirring is continued for 5 hours after the chromium trioxide has been added. The reaction mixture is poured into a large jar two-thirds filled with chipped ice, and cold water is added until the total volume is about 6 l. The mixture is then stirred vigorously for at least 15 minutes to promote solidification of the oily layer. The oily solid is filtered with suction on a Büchner funnel, washed with cold water, and then stirred mechanically with 500 ml. of cold 2% sodium carbonate solution. The solid is then collected on a filter, washed with cold water, and dried in the air. The crude substance is digested with 150 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) for 30 minutes, cooled, and filtered. After having been dried in a vacuum desiccator, the product weighs 21–22 g. (23–24%) and melts at 87–88°.
The arsenoacetic acid consists of minute yellow needles, which do not melt below 260° although they undergo considerable decomposition above 200°. The yield is 5 g. (74 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Methyl (S)-2-phthalimido-4-oxobutanoate . Caution! This reaction must be performed under a well-ventilated hood. Into a 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a gas inlet and a drying tube containing calcium chloride are placed methyl (S)-2-phthalimido-4-methylthiobutanoate (15.45 g, 52.7 mmol) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) (160 mL). The mixture is magnetically stirred under nitrogen at room temperature, N-chlorosuccinimide (7.04 g, 52.7 mmol) is added in one portion, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hr at room temperature. The resulting mixture is filtered through a sintered glass funnel with suction into a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, and the collected succinimide (5.2 g) is rinsed with 100 mL of carbon tetrachloride . The three-necked flask containing the filtrate and rinse is equipped with a gas inlet, a stopper, and a cold water condenser. The condenser is equipped with a gas outlet that in turn is connected to a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 200 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution (commercial bleach) to scavenge volatile sulfur-containing by-products. Water (320 mL) is added in one portion, and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution at a rate of 2.4-3.0 mL/sec for a period of 20 hr at room temperature. The resulting phases are separated using a separatory funnel, and the acidic aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 50 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (100 mL), and water (100 mL) and then dried over sodium sulfate . The solution is filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give 14.0 g of crude product as a pale yellow oil. Chromatography of this oil over silica gel gives a white solid that is triturated at −15°C (ice-salt bath) using 20 mL of diethyl ether to provide 7.50-9.19 g (54-67%) of analytically pure aldehyde as a white solid (mp 52-103°C), and.
The solid residue is decomposed by adding approximately 400 ml. of ice and water, and the resulting mixture is carefully acidified with 50% sulfuric acid. The organic layer is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether and washed with 50 ml. of brine. The original aqueous phase and the brine wash are then extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the ether is distilled. The product is then distilled under reduced pressure through a good column. The yield of 1-ethynylcyclohexanol is 81–93 g. (65–75%), b.p. 74°/14 mm.; n20D 1.4822.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 165 g. (1 mole) of ethyl p-aminobenzoate, 300 cc. of water, and 204 cc. (2.5 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This mixture is warmed on a steam bath for an hour with occasional shaking. The flask containing the resulting white paste of p-carbethoxyaniline hydrochloride is placed in an ice-salt bath and cooled to 0°. The mixture is stirred mechanically, and a solution of 72.6 g. (1 mole) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in a minimum quantity of water is run in slowly while the temperature is kept below 7°. The diazotization is complete when a faint positive test for nitrous acid with starch-iodide paper persists for ten minutes.
The crystalline precipitate, which is a mixture of sodium chloride and pimelic acid, is then collected on a suction filter without washing. The product is dried in an evaporating dish on the water bath for several hours, with frequent stirring, whereby the brown mass is partially melted. The mass, after cooling, is transferred to a 500-cc. Soxhlet thimble. The Soxhlet apparatus is mounted over a hot plate and the solid extracted with about 650 cc. of benzene. Complete extraction is indicated when the liquid in the siphon is no longer turbid. The extraction is complete when evaporation of a small quantity of the solution in the extractor leaves no residue (two to three hours). After the extraction is complete, the benzene solution is concentrated to about 300 cc. and the pimelic acid allowed to crystallize. The crystals are collected on a filter, washed with cold benzene, and dried in the air. The product melts at 104–105° and weighs 50–58 g. (43–50 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 50-ml., round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon®-covered magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser connected to a gas-inlet tube, is charged with 970 mg. (2.51 mmoles) of cholest-4-en-3β-ol and 30 ml. of o-xylene. The mixture is stirred to effect solution before 1.67 g. (0.0125 mole) of N,N-dimethylacetamide dimethyl acetal is added. The flask is flushed with argon, then heated at reflux under a positive pressure of argon with vigorous stirring for 65 hours. After cooling, the volatile materials are removed at reduced pressure, and the yellow, oily residue (1.2 g.) is chromatographed on 60 g. of silica gel with diethyl ether. Elution of the column with 200 ml. of ether gives a mixture of cholestadienes which is discarded; further elution with 500 ml. of ether affords 740 mg. of N,N-dimethyl-5β-cholest-3-ene-5-acetamide as a clear, colorless oil, which on trituration with acetone gives 740 mg. (65%) of the amide as white plates, m.p. 128–129.5°.
A pressure vessel is charged in order with 600 ml. of dry toluene, 25 g. (0.30 mole) of anhydrous sodium acetate, 3 g. of dry, 10% palladium-on-carbon catalyst, 23 g. (0.10 mole) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl chloride, and 1 ml. of Quinoline S. The pressure vessel is flushed with nitrogen, sealed, evacuated briefly, and pressured to 50 p.s.i. with hydrogen. The mixture is shaken with 50 p.s.i. of hydrogen for 1 hour at room temperature, then heated at 35–40° for 2 hours. Agitation is continued overnight while the reaction mixture cools to room temperature. The pressure on the vessel is released, the vessel is opened, and the mixture is filtered through 10 g. of Celite filter aid, and the insoluble material is washed with 25 ml. of toluene. The combined filtrates are washed successively with 25 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution and 25 ml. of water. The toluene solution is dried over 5 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated by distillation at reduced pressure using a water aspirator. The residue is distilled through a 10-cm. Vigreux column with warm water circulating through the condenser, to prevent crystallization of the distillate, yielding 12.5–16.2 g. (64–83%) of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde, b.p. 158–161° (7–8 mm.), m.p. 74–75° and.
In a tared 1-l. flask is placed 200 g. (1.5 moles) of 24 per cent aqueous methylamine solution, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the solution is acid to methyl red; about 155 cc. of acid is required. Water is added to bring the total weight to 500 g., 300 g. (5 moles) of urea is added, and the solution is boiled gently under reflux for two and three-quarters hours and then vigorously for one-quarter hour. The solution is cooled to room temperature, 110 g. (1.5 moles) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite is dissolved in it, and the whole is cooled to 0°. A mixture of 600 g. of ice and 100 g. (1 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 3-l. beaker is surrounded by an efficient freezing mixture, and the cold methylurea-nitrite solution is run in slowly with mechanical stirring at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0°.
C. 2,2'-Dimethoxy-6-formylbiphenyl. To a flame-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask, under nitrogen, and fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is added 12.2 g (0.039 mol) of pure biphenyloxazoline 2 in 300 mL of dry dichloromethane. To this is added 7.9 g (0.048 mol) of methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate and the chilled solution is stirred at room temperature for 2–3 hr. The solution of quaternized oxazoline is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath. Separately, 3.3 g (0.87 mol) of sodium borohydride is slurried at 0°C with 125 mL of absolute ethanol. The chilled slurry is added slowly, to control foaming, to the reaction mixture. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred at 0°C for 45 min and the contents of the flask are evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting solid residue is dissolved in 400 mL of 4:1 tetrahydrofuran-water and 19.5 g (0.217 mol) of oxalic acid is added in portions (exotherm). The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 16–18 hr. Tetrahydrofuran is removed under rotary evaporation to leave behind an aqueous slurry that is washed in a separatory funnel with pentane-ether (1:1, 2 × 100 mL). The upper layer is removed and the aqueous layer is extracted again with 50 mL of pentane-ether. The organic layers are combined and washed with 50 mL of aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate and then with 50 mL of saturated brine. The aqueous washes are also back-extracted with pentane-ether which is combined with the other organic solutions. The organic layers are dried over sodium sulfate (anhydrous) and the solution is filtered through Celite. Concentration of the solution under reduced pressure gives 7.5 g (75–83%) of the final biphenyl aldehyde, mp 65–67°C. Recrystallization from 2-propanol gives 6.5 g of pure material,.
A mixture of 200 g. (3.1 gram atoms) of zinc dust and 300 cc. of water is placed in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. The suspension is then stirred vigorously while a solution of 100 g. (0.73 mole) of N-nitrosomethylaniline (p. 460) in 200 cc. (210 g., 3.5 moles) of glacial acetic acid is added in a slow stream. The temperature is maintained between 10° and 20° by external cooling or by the addition of finely crushed ice. When all the acid solution has been added (about one and one-half to two hours is required, depending upon the rate of cooling) the mixture is stirred for an hour longer at room temperature and then warmed to 80° on the steam bath. The hot solution is filtered from the unreacted zinc, which is washed with three 100-cc. portions of a warm 5 per cent hydrochloric acid solution. The combined filtrate and washings are cooled and treated with sufficient 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to redissolve the zinc hydroxide precipitated. (About 1.2 l. is required.) The oily layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted with two or three 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined oil and extracts are distilled from a steam bath until the ether is removed; the residue is then distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of colorless α-methyl-α-phenylhydrazine boiling at 106–109° 13 mm. is 46–50 g. (52–56 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To the flask are added 13.4 g. (0.58 mole) of clean sodium and 200 ml. of absolute toluene. The Vibromischer stirrer is activated, the toluene heated to reflux, and the agitation continued at this temperature until all the sodium is pulverized into a very fine sand. The agitation is ceased, and the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature. The nitrogen flow rate is increased, the Vibromischer stirrer is replaced with a conventional sealed mechanical stirrer with a Teflon® blade, and a solution of 85 g. (0.6 mole) of 2-carbomethoxycyclopentanone in 450 ml. of absolute benzene is placed in the addition funnel.
B. Ethyl α-(bromomethyl)acrylate. In a nitrogen-flushed, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, Dean-Stark trap, and condenser are placed 42.0 g (0.25 mol) of α-(bromomethyl)acrylic acid and 300 mL of benzene. Approximately 50 mL of a binary azeotrope of benzene and water is distilled. The Dean-Stark trap is removed and 100 mL of absolute ethanol and 1 mL of concentrated sulfuric acid are added slowly. The contents of the flask are boiled in a nitrogen atmosphere for 36 hr, the condensate being passed through 100 g of molecular sieves (Linde 3A) before being returned to the flask. About 125 mL of a mixture of benzene and ethanol is removed from the reaction mixture by distillation (at 67°C). Then 100 mL of benzene is added and another 125 mL of benzene-ethanol mixture distilled (67–75°C). The residue is poured into 200 mL of water and neutralized with solid sodium bicarbonate (ca. 10–15 g) until CO2 evolution ceases. The resulting solution is extracted with three 75-mL portions of ether, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate for 3 hr. The ether is removed under reduced pressure in a rotary evaporator, and crude ester distilled to give a fraction at 39–40°C (0.9 mm) that weighs 33–34 g (71%). The ester is of high purity, as evidenced by spectral analysis.
A 500-ml. round-bottomed flask is attached by a well-lubricated ground-glass joint to a reflux condenser with a side take-off having a stopcock which may be opened to permit distillation. In the flask are placed 170 ml. of commercial diethylene glycol and 30 g. (0.46 mole) of potassium hydroxide (U.S.P., or reagent grade, 85%). This mixture is heated carefully (Caution!) until the potassium hydroxide begins to melt and go into solution; then the heat is removed intermittently until the exothermic dissolution is completed. After the solution has been cooled to 80–100°, the condenser is removed and there are added to the flask 35 g. (0.152 mole) of 6-ketohendecanedioic acid (p. 555) and 22 ml. (22.4 g., 0.38 mole) of commercial 85% hydrazine hydrate. The condenser is immediately replaced, and the mixture is warmed cautiously until any exothermic reaction is complete and then heated under reflux for 1 hour.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser is placed 200 ml. of dry benzene. A mixture of 300 g. (5.08 moles) of finely divided acetamide and 200 g. (0.9 mole) of powdered phosphorus pentasulfide is prepared quickly and transferred immediately to the flask. To this is added 20 ml. of a mixture of 400 ml. (4.97 moles) of chloroacetone and 150 ml. of dry benzene. The exothermic reaction is started by careful heating in a water bath. The water bath is removed, and the remainder of the chloroacetonebenzene mixture is introduced gradually through the reflux condenser and. When all the chloroacetone has been added and reaction is no longer apparent, the mixture is refluxed on the water bath for 30 minutes.
The crude product is purified by recrystallization from about 1250 cc. of 1 N hydrochloric acid. This gives 100–110 g. of pure fumaric acid, melting at 282–284° in a sealed tube. An additional amount of the acid may be obtained by concentrating the filtrate to a small volume on a water bath. The total yield of pure fumaric acid is 120–138 g. (50–58 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. (S)-N-(N-tert-Butoxycarbonylprolyl)dihydroisoindole (2). A dry, 100-mL, two-necked flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a septum cap is charged with (S)-N-tert-butoxycarbonylproline (5.05 g, 23.5 mmol), dihydroisoindole (2.54 g, 21.3 mmol), and dichloromethane (25 mL) under an argon atmosphere. After cooling to 0 °C with the aid of an ice-water bath, a solution of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 5.1 g, 24.7 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) is added and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature while stirring overnight. The mixture is filtered through Celite, concentrated, and purified by column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexanes:1/3) to afford (S)-N-(N-tert-butoxycarbonylprolyl)dihydroisoindole (4.1 g, 61%) as a white solid.
After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred for 5 minutes at 65° then cooled to 5–10° in an ice bath. The precipitated solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with 50 ml. of cold water, and pressed, removing most of the liquid. Inorganic contaminants, usually present in small amounts, are removed by dissolving the solid in 350 ml. of boiling acetone and filtering the hot solution through fluted filter paper. Concentration of the filtrate on a rotary evaporator gives a dark red crude product (10.5–11.4 g.), which is dissolved in 220–240 ml. of boiling 95% ethanol. On cooling the solution to 5°, the alkylated quinone crystallizes in brownish-yellow needles, which are collected by filtration and air-dried, yielding 6.7–8.0 g., m.p. 135–137°. Recrystallization from 30 ml. of ethanol per gram of product gives 6.6–7.4 g. (61–69%) of 2-phenoxymethyl-1,4-benzoquinone, m.p. 137–138°.
A 200-mL two-necked, round-bottomed flask connected to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold through a three-way stopcock is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a vacuum/nitrogen inlet, and a glass stopper. A microcrystalline sample of [60]fullerene (2.00 g, 2.78 mmol) is placed in the 200-mL flask and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. The glass stopper is replaced with a rubber septum, and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (90 mL) is introduced into the flask via a syringe under nitrogen. The rubber septum is again replaced with a glass stopper. The reaction mixture is cooled with an ice/water bath and stirred under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 30 min to remove dissolved oxygen. Then the flask is flushed with nitrogen and warmed to room temperature (approximately 23 °C).
B. trans-2-Benzyl-1-methylcyclopropan-1-ol (2). To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and rubber septum, is added a mixture of 2.5 g (21 mmol) of allylbenzene, 2 mL (20 mmol) of ethyl acetate, and 20 mL of a 1M solution of chlorotitanium triisopropoxide in hexane, and 160 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). After the mixture has been cooled to 0°C with an ice bath under a nitrogen atmosphere, a 1M solution of cyclopentylmagnesium chloride in ether (80 mL, 80 mmol;) is added over a period of 2.5 hr via a syringe pump. After the addition is complete, the resulting black reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min at 0°C, then is quenched by the cautious addition of water (15 mL). The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature and filtered through a pad of Celite, which is rinsed thoroughly with ether (4 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate and rinsings are poured into a separatory funnel containing 50 mL of water and shaken thoroughly. The organic phase is separated, washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. Purification of the crude product (obtained as a pale yellow oil) by column chromatography on 80 g of silica gel using 1:20 ethyl acetate:hexane as the eluent provides 2.6 g (80%) of trans-2-benzyl-1-methylcyclopropan-1-ol (2) as a colorless oil.
A mixture of 100 g. of phthalide and 100 g. of powdered potassium cyanide is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a thermometer. The stirred mixture is heated to 180–190° (internal temperature) for 4–5 hours in an oil bath. One liter of water is added to the cooled mass, and the mixture is stirred until the solid salts are dissolved. Any insoluble material that separates is removed by filtration. Under a hood, 6 N hydrochloric acid (20–60 ml.) is added to the dark aqueous solution until it becomes turbid. The solution is carefully neutralized with sodium bicarbonate, a few grams of Norit is added, and the mixture is stirred for several minutes and filtered. The nearly colorless filtrate is acidified with 40–50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and, after cooling in an ice bath, is filtered with suction. The yield is 80–100 g. (67–83%) of white crystals which melt at 113–115°.
The product is dissolved in 100 ml. of petroleum ether, b.p. 30–40°, with warming, and the solution is transferred to a chromatographic column consisting of 75 g. of silica gel. The product is eluted sequentially with (A) 300 ml. of petroleum ether, (B) 300 ml. of 3:1 (v/v) petroleum ether:benzene, (C) 300 ml. of 1:1 (v/v) petroleum ether:benzene, (D) 600 ml. of 1:3 (v/v) petroleum ether:benzene, and (E) 600 ml. of benzene. Fractions A and B are discarded. The oil (8.50–9.15 g.) obtained by distillation of the solvent from the combined fractions C, D, and E is dissolved in 65 ml. of petroleum ether. Cooling gives 5.00–6.61 g. of colorless needles, m.p. 44–45°. Concentration of the filtrate and cooling yield successive crops of product, m.p. 41–45°. The total yield is 7.45–8.15 g. (71–78%).
C. S-(1-Acetylamino-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl) O-ethyl dithiocarbonate (3). A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar, is charged with N-(1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoro-ethyl)acetamide 2 (9.2 g, 52 mmol) and EtOH (100 mL). Potassium O-ethyl xanthate (9.2 g, 57 mmol) is added in portions over a period of 5 min. The resulting mixture is stirred at ambient temperature for 15 min before the reaction is quenched with water (100 mL). The solution is extracted with ether/hexanes solution (7:3, 3 × 150 mL), the combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to provide a solid residue which is dried under vacuum (25 °C, 1 mmHg) for 1 h to give xanthate 3 (12.5 g, 91%) as a white solid.
A. Dibenzyl sulfide. A solution of 25.8 g. (0.212 mole) of benzyl chloride in 75 ml. of 95% ethanol contained in a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient bulb condenser (Allihn) and a magnetic stirrer is brought to gentle reflux with a heating mantle. With stirring and heating, a solution of 36 g. (0.15 mole) of sodium sulfide nonahydrate in 50 ml. of water is added with a dropping funnel over a 4-hour period. The solution is heated at reflux for 3 days, after which the ethanol is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The hot aqueous solution is poured with stirring into a 250-ml. beaker half-filled with chipped ice. After the ice has melted, the resulting yellow solid is filtered on a Büchner funnel and washed with 50 ml. of water. After air-drying, the solid is distilled from an ordinary 50-ml. Claisen flask, yielding 17.6 g. (80%) of dibenzyl sulfide, b.p. 120° (0.15 mm.), which is pure enough to use directly in the next step. Recrystallization from 70% ethanol gives a pure sample, m.p. 46–48°.
To a solution of 122 g. (1 mole) of pure salicylaldehyde in 1000 cc. of normal sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature, is added 1420 g. (1.2 moles) of 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide. The mixture darkens slightly in color and the temperature rises to 45–50°. The solution is allowed to stand for fifteen to twenty hours, whereupon a few drops of acetic acid are added in order to neutralize any excess alkali, and the solution evaporated to complete dryness on the water bath under reduced pressure.
B. Biphenylene. The solvent-wet benzenediazonium-2-carboxylate is washed from the funnel into a 400-ml. beaker with ca. 150 ml. of 1,2-dichloroethane, dispensed from a plastic wash bottle, with the aid of a plastic spatula. The resultant slurry is added during 3–5 minutes to 1250 ml. of gently boiling, stirred 1,2-dichloroethane in a 2-l. beaker on a magnetic stirrer-hot plate in the hood. Frothing ceases a few minutes after completion of the addition, and the mixture assumes a clear red-brown color, signaling the end of the reaction.
The purplish-gray solid is ground in a large mortar and is poured with vigorous stirring into a 12-l. (3-gallon) crock containing 6 l. of approximately normal hydrochloric acid (5.5 l. of water and 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid). The stirring is continued for one hour after all the benzanilide has been added, and then the solid is filtered on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel. The process of stirring with acid and filtering is repeated twice to remove the excess of aniline. The solid is stirred for two hours with 6 l. of water and is filtered. It is stirred for one hour with 6 l. of normal sodium hydroxide solution to remove the excess of benzoic acid and is then filtered. The stirring with alkali and filtering is repeated. The solid is next stirred for two hours with 7 l. of water and is filtered, sucked dry, and air-dried overnight on paper.
The partially dried 3-bromo-4-acetaminotoluene is refluxed with 500 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask. To the boiling solution is added 500 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and the refluxing is continued for three hours. During this time, crystals of the hydrochloride of 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene separate. The hot mixture is poured into a 2-l. beaker and cooled thoroughly in running water. The hydrochloride is filtered by suction and washed rapidly with two 100-cc. portions of chilled alcohol. The weight of the hydrochloride is 250–300 g..
The moist sodium salt is digested with 50 ml. of cold 6N hydrochloric acid, and after several hours the mixture is filtered and the resulting solid acid dried.
A 300-ml., one-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, the top of which is attached to a nitrogen inlet tube, is charged with 3.85 g. (0.0338 mole) of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, 10 g. (0.025 mole) of ethylene dithiotosylate, and 10 g. of potassium acetate in 150 ml. of methanol. The mixture is refluxed under nitrogen for 3 hours with stirring, the solvent is removed from the reaction mixture on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with cold, aqueous 2 N sodium hydroxide until the aqueous layer is basic to litmus, then with 50 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The ethereal layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The oily residue is diluted with 1 ml. of benzene and 3 ml. of cyclohexane and transferred to a chromatographic column (14 × 2 cm.) prepared with 50 g. of alumina and a 3:1 mixture of cyclohexane and benzene. With this solvent system the desired product moves with the solvent front, and the first 100 ml. of eluent contains 85% of the total product. Further elution with approximately 100 ml. of the same solvent mixture removes the rest of the material before a second component begins to come off. Evaporation of the solvent from the combined 200 ml. of eluent leaves an oily residue which crystallizes on standing, yielding 2.76–3.04 g. (57–64%) of crude 2,2-(ethylenedithio)cyclohexanone. Recrystallization from approximately 50 ml. of pentane affords 2.1–2.6 g. (45–55%) of needles, m.p. 56–57°.
A 3-l. three-necked flask is equipped with a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer prepared from tantalum wire, a condenser arranged for distillation, and a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is heated on a steam cone, and a slow stream of nitrogen is introduced from a cylinder through a line connected to the top of the dropping funnel. To the flask are added 98.1 g. (1.50 g. atoms) of freshly sandpapered zinc foil which has been cut into narrow strips and rolled loosely, and 750 ml. of thiophene-free benzene previously dried over sodium. To dry the apparatus and contents, 175–200 ml. of benzene is slowly distilled with stirring. Heating is interrupted, and the condenser is quickly arranged for reflux. A U-tube just closed with mercury is attached to the top of the condenser, and nitrogen flow is adjusted so that it bubbles slowly through the mercury. The benzene is heated once again to reflux, and a solution of 64.1 g. (0.50 mole) of 2-ethylhexanal and 271.5 g. (1.50 moles) of ethyl α-bromopropionate (Caution!) in 500 ml. of dried benzene is placed in the dropping funnel. The first 50 ml. of the solution is added to the flask at once. Usually reaction begins immediately, as evidenced by darkening of the zinc surface and clouding of the solution, but in some cases as much as 15 minutes elapses before the start of reaction. When the reaction has started, the remainder of the aldehyde-bromo ester solution is added during 1 hour, with stirring, as the solution is maintained under reflux. After addition is complete the mixture is heated for an additional 2 hours under reflux, and then cooled to room temperature.
Methyl 2-(2-acetylphenyl)acetate. An oven-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar, and cesium fluoride (19.7 g, 130 mmol, 2.5 equiv) is added. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser in the middle neck, an adaptor equipped with a thermometer in one of the side necks, and a septum in the other side neck. The condenser is equipped with a vacuum adaptor connected to a Schlenk line (nitrogen/vacuum manifold). The connected glassware is evacuated under high vacuum (0.025 mmHg) and carefully back-filled with nitrogen. This procedure is repeated twice to secure an oxygen-free atmosphere in the flask. Dry MeCN (260 mL) is added to the flask via a syringe through the septum. While stirring the reaction mixture, methyl acetoacetate (5.60 mL, 6.01 g, 51.8 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (15.7 mL, 19.3 g, 64.7 mmol, 1.25 equiv) are added through the septum via syringes. The flask is submerged in an oil bath (100 °C) and the reaction mixture is heated to reflux (internal temperature: 78-81 °C, reached after 15 min). The mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 40 min. Initially, the reaction mixture is a white opaque suspension, but during heating it changes color to yellow and upon reflux the color changes to orange. As the reaction progresses the opaque solution becomes transparent and the color changes back to yellow. Throughout the entire time a white precipitate is present in the flask. The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath and allowed to cool to ambient temperature (23 °C) over the course of 1 h. The flask is disconnected from the condenser and the nitrogen inlet, and the reaction mixture is diluted with saturated aqueous NaCl solution (200 mL). This mixture is carefully poured into a 1-L separatory funnel. After the layers are separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and filtered. Concentration of the dried organic layers is effected by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 45 mmHg) which affords an orange, viscous oil. Partial purification is achieved by flash chromatography (4.5 × 24 cm, 170 g silica gel) using a gradient of hexanes to 40% Et2O in hexanes. The crude product is loaded on the column with benzene (20 mL). Fraction collection (50 mL fractions) is begun as the crude product is eluted first with 100 mL of hexanes, followed by 1500 mL of 9:1 hexanes:Et2O, 2000 mL of 4:1 hexanes:Et2O, 1000 mL of 7:3 hexanes:Et2O and finally 750 mL of 3:2 hexanes:Et2O. Fractions 38-85 are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30-35 °C, 45 mmHg) to afford 7.96 g (80%) of a slightly yellow solid. The partially purified product is further purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation at 124-130 °C (0.75 mmHg) which affords 6.63 g (67%) of the title compound as an off-white, crystalline solid.
In a loosely stoppered 1-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 37.5 g. (48 ml.) of t-butyl alcohol, 150 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide, and a Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar. The solution is heated in an oil bath which is placed on a combination magnetic stirrer-hotplate. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 125–130°, 75 g. (0.67 mole) of alcohol-free potassium t-butoxide and is added, the stopper is replaced loosely, and the mixture is stirred. When all the potassium t-butoxide is in solution, the stopper is removed, 25 g. (0.159 mole, 17 ml.) of bromobenzene is added in one portion to the hot solution, and an air condenser fitted with a drying tube is rapidly placed on the flask. The solution immediately turns dark brown, and an extremely vigorous, exothermic reaction occurs. After 1 minute the reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml. of water. The aqueous solution is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extract is washed with three 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is distilled at atmospheric pressure on a steam bath to leave 17–18 g. of crude phenyl t-butyl ether. The brown oil is distilled to yield 10–11 g. (42–46%) of pure phenyl t-butyl ether, b.p. 45–46° (2 mm.), m.p. −17 to −16°, n25D 1.4860–1.4890. The ether may be hydrolyzed readily to phenol.
F. cis-7,8-Dimethylbicyclo[4.2.0]oct-7-ene. A 1-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 50.5 g. (0.250 mole) of the sulfone from Part E and 200 ml. of dry dioxane. The solution is blanketed with nitrogen, and the flask is fitted with a side-arm adapter having a nitrogen inlet and a rubber septum. With ice cooling and magnetic stirring, 150 ml. of 2.5 M n-butyllithium in hexane (0.375 mole) is added by syringe,. The resulting yellow-orange heterogeneous mixture is transferred under nitrogen to a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and introduced over 25 minutes to a stirred refluxing mixture of lithium aluminum hydride (32.0 g., 0.843 mole) and 2 l. of dry dioxane,. Upon completion of the addition, the contents are heated at reflux temperature with a mantle for 20 hours, whereupon 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium sulfate is added dropwise with cooling. The precipitated solids are separated by filtration and washed repeatedly with hexane. The combined filtrates are diluted with an additional liter of hexane and washed with four 1-l. portions of water. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and carefully concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual cyclobutene is purified by distillation, yielding 10.0–12.5 g. (29.5–37%) of colorless oil, b.p. 63–65° (33 mm.),.
In a thoroughly dry 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and a Y-tube containing a calcium chloride drying tube and a thermometer are placed 24.2 g. (26 ml., 0.20 mole) of α-phenylethylamine and 50 ml. of dry benzene. The solution is cooled in an ice-salt bath to 5°, and a solution of 44.5 g. (50 ml., 0.41 mole) of tert-butyl hypochlorite2 in 50 ml. of dry benzene is added at such a rate as to maintain the temperature below 10°. After the addition of the tert-butyl hypochlorite solution is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature 1–4 hours.
In a 300-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an nitrogen inlet tube, a dropping funnel, and a rubber septum are placed 7.45 g (0.0559 mol) of powdered aluminum chloride and a magnetic stirring bar. After 100 mL of dichloromethane is introduced, the crude acid chloride, dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, is added via the dropping funnel to the stirred suspension of aluminum chloride at 0°C over 5 min, whereupon most of the aluminum chloride dissolves. After further stirring at 0°C for 15 min and at room temperature for 15 min, the flask is recooled in an ice bath and 100 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid is cautiously added through the dropping funnel. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted 3 times with 50-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are successively washed with 30 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid and 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed under ordinary pressure and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 2-methyl-2-vinylcyclopentanone as a clear liquid (3.74–5.6 g, 56–84% yield based on the methyl tiglate), bp 104–124°C (110 mm), ca. 95% pure by GLC.
A rapid stream of hydrogen chloride is run into the mixture, which is cooled with running water. In about two hours a layer of chloromethyl ether begins to appear. The stream of hydrogen chloride is continued for two or three hours longer until the solution is saturated. The layer of chloromethyl ether is then separated. The water layer is saturated with calcium chloride, and more ether separates. This is added to the main portion, which is then dried over calcium chloride and fractionally distilled. The yield of product boiling at 55–60° is 580–600 g. (86–89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the formaldehyde).
After the solution is warmed to 25°C, 5% phosphoric acid (H3PO4) (150 mL) is added to the reaction mixture, and the resulting biphasic mixture is stirred for 20 min. The layers are partitioned and the organic phase is washed with additional 5% H3PO4 (3 × 150 mL). Combined aqueous phases are extracted with ether (3 × 200 mL). The original organic phase and the ethereal extracts are combined, washed with brine (200 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and the solvents are removed under reduced pressure to afford crude product as an off-white solid. The crude (R)-(+)-2-(diphenylhydroxymethyl)-N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pyrrolidine is purified by recrystallization from a mixture of hexanes-ethyl acetate (~675 mL, 20 : 1, v/v) affording in two crops 20.9–22.0 g (73–74%) of analytically pure product as a white solid having greater than 99.5% ee.
After the addition of the last of the p-nitroaniline, the stream of phosgene is continued for five minutes and then shut off. The flame under the flask is then turned up and the ethyl acetate distilled. Care must be taken at the end not to overheat the residue. The brown residue is treated with 800 cc. of hot dry carbon tetrachloride, and the insoluble residue (the disubstituted urea) is removed by filtration.
C. Methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate.Paraformaldehyde (30 g) is placed in a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask. An argon inlet is connected to one of the necks. The other neck is connected to a 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask via Tygon tubing (2 cm id) and two male 24/40 joints. In the 1-L flask, 2-carbomethoxy-6-nitrobenzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide (50.91 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of dichloromethane. A glass tube is attached to the Tygon tubing such that the end extends several cm into the solution. Triethylamine (39.13 g, 53.8 mL, 386.7 mmol) is added to the 1-L flask, resulting in the immediate formation of a deep blue/purple solution; a condenser is attached to the second neck of the flask. Argon is then passed over the paraformaldehyde so that a steady stream of gas is constantly bubbling through the purple ylide solution. The paraformaldehyde is heated to 160°C (oil bath) in order to generate formaldehyde, which flows through the solution. Upon completion of the addition of formaldehyde, the purple color of the ylide slowly changes from deep purple to brown over a period of 1-2 hr, indicating completion of the reaction. The resulting solution is poured into 500 mL of hexanes, forming a precipitate, which is removed by filtration. The precipitate is washed with 100 mL of hexanes and the combined filtrate and wash are concentrated at water aspirator pressure on a rotary evaporator. The crude yellow-brown solid is dissolved in 100 mL of dichloromethane; 30 g of silica gel is added and the mixture is concentrated again. The resulting powder applied to a pre-packed silica gel column (40 × 4 cm), and eluted with 7:3 hexanes:ethyl acetate to give methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate (15.87 g, 76.6 mmol, 81%, Notes 12-14) as pale yellow crystals.
In a dry, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a drying tube are placed 44.8 g (0.20 mol) of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 35.0 g (0.25 mol) of anhydrous potassium carbonate, 6.5 g (0.20 mol) of sulfur, and 300 mL of methanol. The mixture is stirred for 40 hr at room temperature. The cloudy yellow mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite and the filter cake is washed with 80 mL of dichloromethane. The combined mother liquor and wash is evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator. The orange residue is dissolved in 500 mL of hot water and the hot solution is filtered to remove insoluble impurities. The aqueous filtrate is reheated and the product crystallizes on cooling. The white needles are collected by filtration, washed with 50 mL of cold water and air dried for 1 hr. The mother liquor is concentrated to yield a second crop of crystals to give a total of 15–16 g (58–62%) of pure 1, 3-dimethylimidazole-2-thione, mp 182–183.5°C.
B. Indium(I) iodide . To a 1-L, oven-dried, round-bottomed flask flushed with argon and equipped with a magnetic stirrer is added xylenes (400 mL). The solvent is degassed and the flask is equipped with a reflux condenser. Indium(III) iodide (18.30 g, 36.93 mmol) is added to the flask, and the mixture is stirred vigorously while indium powder (2.12 g, 18.46 mmol) is added. The mixture is stirred vigorously at reflux under argon for 18 hr. The resulting yellow suspension is allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with ether (400-500 mL) and stirred for 1 hr. The resulting burgundy precipitate is filtered under air and washed with ether (100 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure to yield 6.14 g (92%) of indium(I) iodide . The filtrate is concentrated to dryness on a rotary evaporator, venting with nitrogen, to yield 14.4 g (105% based on eq B.) of recovered indium(III) iodide.
B. Cyclobutyl tosylate. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a stirrer and a theromometer is charged with 200 mL of pyridine and 32.3 g (0.448 mol) of cyclobutanol. The solution is stirred and chilled to 0°C, and then 89.8 g (0.471 mol) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is added in portions over a 20-min period. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for 16 hr. The mixture is recooled to 0°C, and poured into 260 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 800 mL of ice water. The mixture is extracted with three 300-mL portions of ether and the combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is held under high vacuum (0.03 mm) at room temperature for 3 hr to give 93.3 g (92%) of cyclobutyl tosylate as a pale-yellow oil.
B. Di(tert-butyl) (2S)-4,6-dioxo-1,2-piperidinedicarboxylate. Ethyl acetate (330 mL) is added to the 500-mL flask containing 2, which is then equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a reflux condenser. The solution is heated in an oil bath at 80 °C (bath temperature) for 3 h. The solution is allowed to cool before being transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is washed successively with 200 mL of 1 N aq KHSO4 solution and 200 mL of brine. The organic layer is dried over Na2SO4 (25–30 g), filtered through a cotton plug in a funnel, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (34–40 °C, 6 mm Hg). The residual crystalline material is slurried in 100 mL of cyclohexane, then is collected by filtration in a Hirsch funnel and is washed with two, 50-mL portions of cyclohexane and then dried under reduced pressure (40 °C, 6 mm Hg) to afford 12.61 g (78%, 2 steps from 1) of dioxopiperidine 3 as a white solid.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stopper holding a reflux condenser and separatory funnel, are placed 500 g. (10 moles) of powdered sodium cyanide (96–98 per cent pure) and 450 cc. of water. The mixture is warmed on a water bath in order to dissolve most of the sodium cyanide, and then 1 kg. (8 moles) of benzyl chloride (b.p. 170–180°) mixed with 1 kg. of 95 per cent alcohol is run in through the separatory funnel in the course of one-half to three-quarters of an hour. The mixture is then heated under a reflux condenser on the steam bath for four hours, cooled and filtered with suction to remove most of the sodium chloride. It is well to wash the filtered salt with a small portion of alcohol in order to remove any benzyl cyanide which may have been mechanically held.
(C) Reduction: 1,2-Aminonaphthol Hydrochloride.—The suspension of Orange II is heated to 45–50°, when all the material dissolves with slight evolution of gas. About one-tenth of 230 g. (about 1.1 moles) of technical sodium hydrosulfite is added cautiously and the mixture is stirred until the froth subsides; the remainder is then added without delay. The yellow material which first separates (probably the hydrazo compound) soon is converted into the nearly colorless aminonaphthol. In order to complete the reduction and to give an easily filterable product the mixture is heated strongly until it begins to froth; it is then cooled to 25° by stirring in an ice bath, and the pink or cream-colored product is collected and washed free from the slightly yellow mother liquor with water.
During this time, a second system is assembled, consisting of a 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser topped with a calcium chloride-filled drying tube attached to a xylene-filled bubbler, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel through which a slow stream of nitrogen is passed into the flask. In the flask are placed 200 ml. of sodium-dried xylene and 11.5 g. (0.5 g. atom) of sodium. The mixture is heated to boiling, and the sodium is finely dispersed by rapid stirring. Stirring is continued while the mixture is allowed to cool in a nitrogen atmosphere. The cooled mixture is allowed to settle, and the bulk of the xylene is siphoned. Tetrahydrofuran (200 ml.) is added through the separatory funnel, and to the stirred mixture, cooled in ice, is added 42 ml. (0.5 mole) of cyclopentadiene in portions during 1 hour. Stirring is continued for 2–3 hours in the cold, after which only a small amount of sodium remains unreacted.
This is then distilled under reduced pressure from an oil bath, and the fraction boiling at 107–109°/12 mm. (116–118°/20 mm.) is collected as pure material. The yield is 700–705 g. (79–80 per cent of the theoretical amount). There is practically no residue beyond a little salt; the foreruns consist of water, a small amount of unchanged ethylene chlorohydrin, and some ethylene cyanohydrin.
In an 8-l. (2-gal.) earthenware crock, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a tube for introducing steam, are placed 240 g. (1.39 moles) of nitroso-β-naphthol (from 200 g. of β-naphthol, Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 411), 1.5 l. of water, and 300 cc. of 5 N sodium hydroxide. The lumps are broken up with a rod, and the mixture is stirred for about thirty minutes. At the end of this time, practically all the nitroso compound is dissolved and 1.2 l. of 5 N sodium hydroxide is added. Steam is passed in until the temperature of the mixture is 35°, and then the steam is shut off and 600 g. of technical sodium hydrosulfite (at least 85 per cent pure) is added while the solution is being stirred. The solution is stirred continuously for five minutes while the temperature rises to 60–65°, and then for one minute at five-minute intervals during one-half hour. At the end of about fifteen minutes the solution becomes clear and light yellow in color. A small amount of black scum floats on the surface.
The mixture is cooled and washed five times with 50-cc. portions of 5 per cent sodium carbonate solution. It is then distilled under reduced pressure, fractions being taken up to 130°/40 mm. and at 130–150°/40 mm. The residue amounts to about 20 g.. The lower-boiling fraction is redistilled. The combined fractions boiling at 130–150°/40 mm. are redistilled under reduced pressure. The product boiling at 132–136°/33 mm. (121–125°/16 mm.) amounts to 175–180 g. (73–75 per cent of the theoretical amount). Redistillation of the low fractions gives about 15 g. more of the product.
The excess lithium aluminum hydride and the metallic complexes are decomposed by the careful addition of 82 ml. of distilled water, from a dropping funnel, to the well-stirred mixture. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, filtered with suction, and the solid is washed with several 100-ml. portions of ether. After the ether is removed from the filtrates, the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of laurylmethylamine, a colorless liquid boiling at 110–115°/1.2–1.5 mm., is 121–142 g. (81–95%).
The trap cooled in Dry Ice-acetone contains about 105 g. of crude product which, when distilled through a column packed with glass helices, yields about 75 g. (80%) of allene. No external heat is needed during the distillation. The distillation flask is allowed to warm to room temperature, the distillation beginning at a liquid temperature of −34° and virtually stopping at about 10°. The distilled product contains no detectable ethanol, water, 2,3-dichloropropene, or methylacetylene as determined by gas-liquid chromatography.
C. β,β-Dichloro-p-dimethylaminostyrene. To the heptane suspension of the phosphorane there is added over a period of 30 minutes 74.5 g. (0.5 mole) of p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde in six equal portions; the reaction temperature is maintained below 10°. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours in an ice bath, for an additional 5 hours at room temperature, and is then allowed to stand overnight. The precipitated phosphine oxide is filtered and the solvent is removed from the filtrate at 45–50° using a rotary evaporator. The resulting brown solid is recrystallized from methanol to yield 74–85 g. (68–79%) of crude olefin, m.p. 56–60°. The major impurity is unreacted triphenylphosphine.
B. N-Chlorocyclohexylideneimine. In a 500-ml. three-necked flask fitted with stirrer, addition funnel, thermometer, and reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube are placed 15 g. (0.15 mole) of potassium acetate and 100 ml. of absolute ethanol. The mixture is heated to reflux temperature, and, when the potassium acetate has dissolved, the N,N-dichlorocyclohexylamine solution is added at such a rate as to maintain reflux. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 3 hours, during which time potassium chloride precipitates. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, 200 ml. of ether and 100 ml. of water are added, and the resulting mixture is transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and discarded. The ethereal layer is washed with three 100-ml. portions of water, three 50-ml. portions of 2N hydrochloric acid, and an additional three 100-ml. portions of water, the washings being discarded. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous calcium sulfate, and the solvent is removed at room temperature with a rotary evaporator and water aspirator. The residue is transferred to a 25-ml. distilling flask and fractionally distilled at reduced pressure through a short, vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column equipped with a Claisen type still head and a condenser through which ice water is circulated. N-Chlorocyclohexylideneimine, b.p. 53–54° (3 mm.) ( Caution!), n25D 1.506, is obtained in 48–69% yield (6.3–9.1 g.).
C. 4a(S),8a(R)-2-Benzoyl-1,3,4,4a,5,8a-hexahydro-6(2H)-isoquinolinone (3). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, Teflon-coated thermocouple, 500-mL addition funnel and a N2 inlet. Concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4), 275 mL is added to the flask and the flask is cooled to 0°C under N2. The addition funnel is charged with a solution of 56.0 g (0.17 mol) of crude benzamide 2 in 60 mL of CH2Cl2, that is added dropwise over 15 min, maintaining the internal temperature between 0-10°C. Upon complete addition, the cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for another 2 hr as the temperature rises to 30°C. The reaction mixture is poured onto 1 kg of crushed ice with stirring and when the ice has melted the two layers are separated. The aqueous phase is extracted further with CH2Cl2 (4 × 200 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with water (2 × 500 mL), brine (500 mL), dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to a light brown semisolid that is dissolved in 100 mL of CH2Cl2 and precipitated with 250 mL of hexanes to furnish 34.7 g (80%) of enone 3 as light yellow crystals.
The total yield of moist product is 125–135 g.; on drying with a little calcium chloride and distilling, 115–125 g. of pure nitromethane, boiling at 98–101°, is obtained (35–38 per cent of the theoretical amount). A small forerun distils over below 98°, and a little dark brown residue remains.
A. 2-Hydroxyimino-2-phenylacetonitrile. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a calcium chloride drying tube, a thermometer, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 117 g. (1.00 mole) of benzyl cyanide and a solution of 40.0 g. (1.00 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of methanol. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled at 0° as methyl nitrite is introduced through the gas-inlet tube, which extends below the surface of the liquid. The methyl nitrite is generated by dropwise addition of a cold solution of 32 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 65 ml. of water from a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel into a 300-ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing a suspension of 83 g. (1.2 moles) of sodium nitrite in 53 ml. of methanol and 50 ml. of water. The rate of generation of methyl nitrite is adjusted so that the reaction temperature does not exceed 15°. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for another 2 hours, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in 500 ml. of water, and the resulting solution is washed with two 100-ml. portions of toluene. The aqueous layer is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and cooled in an ice bath. The resulting precipitate is filtered, washed thoroughly with cold water, and dried, yielding 111–120 g. (76–82%) of 2-hydroxyimino-2-phenylacetonitrile, m.p. 119–124°. This material is used in Part B without further purification.
B. 2,4-Dimethylquinoline. A small quantity of copper powder is added to 4.6 g. (0.2 gram atom) of sodium metal (small pieces) and 56 g. (0.6 mole) of dry aniline contained in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask. The mixture is warmed carefully over a low flame until the evolution of hydrogen ceases, at which time the mixture is usually black. A few boiling chips and 346 g. (2 moles) of acetone-anil are then added. The resulting mixture is heated at the reflux temperature (220–230°) until the evolution of gas (methane) ceases. At the end of the reaction the mixture is cooled and then distilled in vacuum. The fraction boiling at 135–140°/12 mm. weighs 252–283 g. (80–90%).
In a 3-l. beaker are placed 110 g. (1.2 moles) of aniline, 150 g. (1.8 moles) of sodium bicarbonate, and 1 l. of water, and the mixture is cooled to 12–15° by the addition of a small amount of ice. The beaker is then fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The blade of a large porcelain spatula should be inserted into the liquid to overcome the rotary motion and thus obtain better mixing. The stirrer is started and 254 g. (1 mole) of powdered iodine is added in 15–20 g. portions at intervals of two to three minutes so that all the iodine is introduced during one-half hour. Stirring is continued for twenty to thirty minutes. By this time the reaction is complete and the color of the free iodine in the solution has practically disappeared. The crude p-iodoaniline, which separates as a dark crystalline mass, is collected on a Büchner funnel, pressed as free from water as possible, and dried in the air. The filtrate may be saved for the recovery of iodine.
(B) Diphenyl Triketone Hydrate.—A solution of 34.3 g. (0.42 mole) of fused sodium acetate in 142 cc. of hot glacial acetic acid is prepared in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask; 72.4 g. (0.19 mole) of dibenzoyldibromomethane is added, and the mixture is refluxed until the precipitation of sodium bromide ceases (one and one-half to two hours). The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and diluted with 150–200 cc. of water with constant shaking to dissolve the inorganic salt and to precipitate the triketone hydrate, which separates as a white, curdy mass. This is separated by filtration, washed well with water, and dried in an oven at 60°. The melting point varies from 65 to 90°, depending upon the extent of dehydration that occurs during the drying operation. The yield is 41.5 g. (86 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the dibenzoyldibromomethane).
A. 4-Nitrophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1). A dry, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen gas inlet, and rubber septum is charged sequentially with 10.0 g (71.9 mmol) of 4-nitrophenol and 38 mL of pyridine. The stirred solution is cooled to 0°C and 13.5 mL (80 mmol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added through the septum via a syringe. The rate of addition is such that the internal temperature of the flask never exceeds 25°C. The solution is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature and is maintained at room temperature for 25 hr. The reaction is quenched by pouring it into a 250-mL separatory funnel that contains 100 mL of water and 50 mL of diethyl ether. The two phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with four additional 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic fractions are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to provide 18.7 g of crude 1 as a yellow, crystalline, solid.
The distillate is rinsed into a separatory funnel with 25 ml. of ether, and the organic layer is separated and dried over 10 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is separated and rinsed with 25 ml. of ether, and 0.1 g. of p-tert-butylcatechol is added to the solution. The ether is removed, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure. m-Chlorostyrene is obtained in a yield of 102–106 g. (80–82.5%), boiling at 55–57°/3 mm.; nD20 1.5625 and. A small amount (3–8 g.) of m-chlorophenylmethylcarbinol can be recovered as a higher-boiling fraction.
A. Triphenylcinnamylphosphonium chloride. A mixture of 40 g. (0.26 mole) of (3-chloropropenyl) benzene and 92 g. (0.35 mole) of triphenylphosphine in 500 ml. of xylene is heated at reflux for 12 hours with stirring. The mixture is allowed to cool to about 60°, and the colorless crystalline product is filtered, washed with 100 ml. of xylene, and dried in a vacuum oven at about 20 mm. pressure and 60° to constant weight. The yield is 99–101 g. (91–93%), m.p. 224–226°.
(A) From Cholesterol.—One hundred grams (0.26 mole) of commercial cholesterol is crystallized from 250 cc. of glacial acetic acid, using 1 g. of Norite if required, and the purified material is transferred, conveniently without being dried, to a hydrogenation vessel equipped with a thermometer and a heating device. Three hundred cubic centimeters of purified glacial acetic acid and 0.5 g. of platinum oxide are added, and the hydrogenation is conducted at 65–75° at a slight positive pressure. The total amount of hydrogen usually is absorbed in two to four hours. After the hydrogen has been replaced by air the solution is filtered hot and the product is obtained by crystallization and concentration. The total yield of air-dried, partially acetylated dihydrocholesterol, m.p. 130–135°, is 85–90 g.
B. 2,2-Dimethyl-3-Phenylpropionaldehyde. A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with an ether condenser, a nitrogen inlet tube, a 50-ml. Herschberg dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar is evacuated through a mercury bubbler, flamed dry, and flushed with nitrogen three times. The system is left under a slight positive pressure of nitrogen, and all the reactants are added under a stream of nitrogen. A solution of 0.05 mole of ethylmagnesium bromide in 37 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is placed in the flask. A solution of 6.35 g. (0.0567 mole) of N-(2-methylpropylidene)-tert-butylamine in 5 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is then added from the dropping funnel. The resulting mixture is refluxed for 12–14 hours until 1 mole-equivalent of gas has evolved. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature; 6.30 g. (0.0498 mole) of benzyl chloride is added from the dropping funnel; and the solution is refluxed for 20 hours, at which time the pH is 9–10 (pHydrion paper). To the cooled solution, which contains a large amount of solid, is added 20–30 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid. The clear, yellow-brown solution is then refluxed for 2 hours, cooled, saturated with solid sodium chloride, and extracted five times with diethyl ether. The organic extracts are washed once with 25 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid, then repeatedly with brine until the washings are neutral. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed at atmospheric pressure through a 12-in. Vigreux column fitted with a partial take-off head. Distillation of the residue through a 20-in. vacuum-jacketed fractionating column affords 5.1–5.4 g. (63–66%) of 2,2-dimethyl-3-phenylpropionaldehyde, b.p. 70–73° (1.5 mm.).
A solution of 300 g. (2.5 moles) of technical dimethylaniline in 1050 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is placed in a large jar or crock and finely divided ice is added until the temperature has fallen to 5°. The contents of the jar are then stirred mechanically, and a solution of 180 g. (2.6 moles) of sodium nitrite in 300 cc. of water is slowly added from a separating funnel, the stem of which dips beneath the surface of the liquid. The addition takes one hour, and the temperature is kept below 8° by the addition of ice if necessary. When all the nitrite has been added the mixture is allowed to stand one hour and then filtered. The solid p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride is washed with 400 cc. of 1:1 hydrochloric acid and then with 100 cc. of alcohol. After drying in air, it weighs 370–410 g. (80–89 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. (S)-(+)-3-Hydroxy-2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone. In a 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an air-reflux condenser are placed 3 L of tap water and 450 g of sucrose. The mixture is stirred at 30°C, and 200 g of dry baker's yeast is added with stirring, whereupon brisk fermentation takes place. This fermenting mixture is stirred at 30°C for 10 min and a solution of 15 g (0.107 mol) of 2,2-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione in 95% ethanol (30 mL) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (120 mL) is added portionwise. The mixture is stirred at 30°C for 40–48 hr. Diethyl ether (about 200 mL) and Celite (about 50 g) are then added to the mixture and it is left to stand overnight. After the flocculated yeast cells are precipitated, the mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite. The filter cake is washed with ethyl acetate (2 × 100 mL) and the combined filtrate and washings are saturated with sodium chloride and extracted 4 times with 100 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined ethyl acetate extracts are washed with saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution (200 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (200 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Ethyl acetate is removed by rotary evaporation and the residue (about 20 g) is chromatographed over 200 g of silica gel (Fuji Davison 820 MH gel). Elution with hexane–ethyl acetate (10 : 1–5 : 1) gives 5–6 g of recovered starting material. Further elution with hexane-ethyl acetate (5 : 1–1 : 2) gives 7.7–7.9 g (47–52%) of (S)-3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethylcyclohexanone. An analytical sample can be obtained by distillation, bp 85–87°C at 3.7 mm, [α]21D + 23.0° (CHCl3, c 2.0),(Note 14),(Note 15).
A solution of 218 g. (1.12 moles) of p-nitrobenzyl acetate (p. 650) in 500 ml. of hot methanol is prepared in a 2-l. flask. To the hot solution is added 380 g. (1.43 moles) of a 15% solution of sodium hydroxide. The alkali should be added slowly at first with shaking to prevent too vigorous boiling. After standing for 5 minutes, the mixture is poured with vigorous hand stirring into 4.5 kg. of a mixture of cracked ice and water. The precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel and recrystallized from 3 to 3.7 l. of hot water with the aid of 15 g. of Norit. The alcohol is dried at 60° to 65° in an oven for several hours and bottled. The yield of slender, nearly colorless needles amounts to 110–121 g. (64–71%); the product melts at 92–93°.
The crystals (A) are dissolved in the minimum amount of hot ethyl alcohol and decomposed by pouring the solution into dilute hydrochloric acid. The weight of the ester thus obtained is about one-half of that originally taken, and its rotation in absolute alcohol is about [α]5461 +47°, [α]D +44°.
The irradiation apparatus is charged with a solution of 25.0 g (0.277 mol) of 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone in reagent-grade dichloromethane. A gas outlet tube to an efficient hood is placed in one 14/20 standard taper joint; in the other, there is a stopper that can be removed for periodic sampling. The cooling water is turned on and the apparatus is immersed in a dry-ice/2-propanol bath while the chilled solution is saturated with ethylene. The lamp is inserted into the well and turned on. Progress of the irradiation is conveniently followed by gas chromatography. After about 8 hr, most of the starting material has reacted. At this time, the lamp is turned off and the apparatus removed from the cooling bath. The reaction mixture is degassed with a slow stream of nitrogen while it warms to room temperature, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator at a temperature below 30°C. The product is isolated by distillation to afford 27–28 g (86–90%) of 6-methylbicyclo[4.2.0]octan-2-one, bp 62–65°C (3.5 mm) and.
A. N-(4-Bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide (1). With no precautions to exclude air or moisture, a 500-mL round-bottomed flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated egg-shaped magnetic stir bar (38 x 16 mm). 4-Bromoaniline (15.1 g, 88.0 mmol, 1.00 equiv) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (17.1 g, 89.8 mmol, 1.02 equiv) are weighed into plastic weigh boats and added to the vessel through a powder funnel. Dichloromethane (230 mL) is then poured into the vessel from a graduated cylinder, followed by the addition of pyridine (7.8 mL, 97 mmol, 1.1 equiv) by syringe in two portions. The reaction vessel is stoppered with a rubber septum and an 18-gauge needle to vent the reaction to air before stirring (~500 rpm) at room temperature (20 °C) for 16 h.The reaction mixture turns from yellow to clear orange immediately after the addition of pyridine.After the reaction is judged complete by TLC analysis, the reaction mixture is poured into a 2 L separatory funnel containing 800 mL of sat. NH4Cl(aq). The organic layer is separated and the aqueous extracted with dichloromethane (2 x 50 mL). The combined organic layer is then washed with water (400 mL), brine (400 mL) and dried over anhydrous MgSO4 (10.0 g, ~1 min).The drying agent is removed by vacuum filtration through a course-fritted glass Büchner funnel.The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 74 mmHg) to yield 28.5-28.6 g (99% yield) of N-(4-bromophenyl)-4-methylbenzenesulfonamide as a white solid.
The filtrate is brought to a pH of 4.6 with 0.05 M hydrochloric acid just as in the original precipitation, the necessary amount of acid being determined by titration of an aliquot portion, diluted fivefold, with 0.01 M hydrochloric acid; 220–250 cc. of 0.05 M acid is required. As the reprecipitation progresses, the rate at which the acid is added is decreased in order to prevent precipitation at the tip of the capillary tube; vigorous mechanical stirring is, of course, essential. When the acidification is complete, 5 l. of cold distilled water is added and the flocculent precipitate allowed to settle in the refrigerator. After siphoning off the clear supernatant liquid, the casein is collected on a suction funnel, using hardened paper, washed with cold distilled water until free of chloride, sucked as dry as possible, and dried over calcium chloride in a vacuum desiccator. The yield is 23–29 g. of a colorless coherent product which may readily be pulverized in a mortar.
A. 1,4-Diphenyl-5-amino-1,2,3-triazole. A 500-ml. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed stirrer, a thermometer well, and a dropping funnel which is protected by a drying tube and has a pressure-equalizing side arm. A mixture of 35.7 g. (0.3 mole) of phenyl azide and 38.6 g. (0.33 mole) of phenylacetonitrile is placed in the flask. The flask is immersed in an ice-water mixture contained in a 1-gal. Thermos flask. After the reaction mixture has cooled to about 2°, a solution of 24.3 g. (0.45 mole) of sodium methoxide in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol is added dropwise during the course of 2 hours. The reaction mixture is then stirred at 2–5° in the ice-water bath for a period of 48 hours. After the cooling bath has been removed and the flask allowed to warm spontaneously to room temperature, the mixture is filtered by suction on a sintered glass funnel, and the collected product is washed with three 50-ml. portions of absolute ethanol. The dried product weighs 62–65 g. (88–92%) and consists of white, fine platelike crystals, m.p. 169–171°. Recrystallization from benzene does not alter the melting point.
In a 500-cc. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer well, are placed 40 g. (0.333 mole) of mesitylene (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 341) and 60 g. (55.5 cc.) of acetic anhydride. The flask is placed in a bath of ice and water, and the reaction mixture is cooled below 10°. A solution of 31.5 g. (20.8 cc., 0.5 mole) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.51) in 20 g. (19.1 cc.) of glacial acetic acid and 20 g. (18.5 cc.) of acetic anhydride is added, with stirring, over a period of forty minutes, the temperature being kept between 15° and 20°.
The nitrogen line is removed, and to the solution is added 750 ml. of 12N sulfuric acid; the resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 1 hour, and then decanted into a 3-l. separatory funnel. After the two phases have separated, the lower aqueous layer is drawn off into a 3-l. separatory funnel containing 1 l. of water which has been used to wash the reaction flask, and the diluted mixture is extracted twice with 350-ml. portions of benzene which have also been employed to rinse the reaction flask. The original organic layer and the combined benzene extracts are kept separate and are washed successively with 500-ml. portions of water, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and again with water. The two organic portions are now combined, allowed to stand over anhydrous sodium sulfate until clear, then transferred to a 2-l. distilling flask, from which solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure, last traces under aspirator pressure. The residue remaining in the flask weighs 150–165 g. and is dehydrated without further purification.
The combined distillates from the cold traps are allowed to come to room temperature and are placed in a 1-l. separatory funnel with 200 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid solution. The mixture of cis- and trans-cyclooctenes is extracted with 200 ml. of n-pentane and subsequently with two 50-ml. portions of n-pentane. The n-pentane extracts are combined and washed with 170 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution.
Twenty-five milliliters of concentrated ammonium hydroxide is introduced into the 3-l. flask. A solution of 100 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is placed in the 250-ml. dropping funnel, which is loosely stoppered. Stirring is started, and the stopcocks of the two dropping funnels are adjusted so that the solutions will be delivered into the flask at a uniform rate in a period of about 45 minutes. Stirring is continued for an additional 10 minutes. The mixture is then permitted to stand for 1 hour, after which the purplish red precipitate is filtered with suction. Any solid material adhering to the walls of the flask is washed onto the funnel with ethanol. The solid is then washed three times on the funnel with ethanol. The filtrate and washings are discarded. The product is slightly impure diethyl α,α'-dicyano-2,5-dihydroxy-p-benzenediacetate and weighs 36–41 g. (43–49%).
The liquid is filtered with suction through a Gooch crucible with a fixed porous plate, and 100 cc. of water is added. The anthrone crystallizes when the solution is cooled to about 10°. The crystals are filtered with suction on a Büchner funnel and washed with water. After drying on a porous plate the melting point of the material is about 153°. The yield is 80 g. (82.5 per cent of the theoretical amount). On recrystallization from a 3:1 mixture of benzene and petroleum ether about 60 g. of anthrone melting at 154–155° (corr.) is obtained (62 per cent of the theoretical amount).
At the end of 1 hour the condenser is set for distillation. The temperature of the reaction mixture is raised, the mixture is stirred while a slow current of nitrogen is continued, and 300 ml. of a mixture of crude cyclopentanecarboxaldehyde and water is distilled over a period of approximately 2 hours. The crude product is removed in a separatory funnel from the aqueous layer, which is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined with the product and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is filtered into a 250-ml. Claisen flask set for vacuum distillation, the pressure is gradually reduced to 100 mm. to distil ether, and the cyclopentanecarboxyaldehyde is distilled rapidly at 74–78° (100 mm.). The yield of aldehyde (n20D 1.4420–1.4428) is 45–52 g. (46–53%).
A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask, connected to a vacuum/nitrogen manifold through a three-way stopcock, is equipped with a 3-cm Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a vacuum/nitrogen inlet, a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel with a glass stopper, and a glass stopper. The flask is charged with copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (6.84 g, 33.3 mmol) and flushed with nitrogen. The glass stopper on the top of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is replaced with a rubber septum, and the 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of [60]fullerene is transferred to the dropping funnel via a Teflon cannula. The glass stopper on the 500-mL flask is replaced with a rubber septum and tetrahydrofuran (47 mL) is added to the copper complex via syringe. The resulting white suspension is stirred and the flask is placed into an oil bath (approximately 23 °C). A tetrahydrofuran solution of methylmagnesium bromide (3 M, 11.1 mL, 33.3 mmol) is added to this white suspension by syringe, followed by 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone (DMI, 3.62 mL, 33.3 mmol). The organocopper reagent is quickly warmed in an oil bath to 35 °C within 5 min. The 1,2-dichlorobenzene solution of [60]fullerene in the dropping funnel is added at once to the organocopper reagent. The color of the suspension changes to dark brown. The dropping funnel is replaced with a glass stopper.
To 1 l. of boiling water in a 3-l. beaker or large evaporating dish is added 150 g. (0.55 mole) of mercuric chloride; to this mixture is then added, with good stirring, 116 g. (0.54 mole) of sodium p-toluenesulfinate (p. 492). A thick, white, curdy precipitate forms at once, and in a short time sulfur dioxide is evolved copiously. The heating and stirring are continued until no more sulfur dioxide is evolved, which requires about two hours.
B. 4-Bromo-N,N-dimethyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline. A solution of 9.45 g. (0.0500 mole) of N,N-dimethyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline in 200 ml. of dichloromethane is placed in a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, cooled to −10°, and stirred magnetically as 20.5 g. (0.0500 mole) of finely powdered 2,4,4,6-tetrabromo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one is added in 0.5-g. portions. During this addition the temperature of the mixture should be maintained between −10° and 0°. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over a 30-minute period and extracted twice with 50 ml. of aqueous 2 N sodium hydroxide to remove 2,4,6-tribromophenol. The organic layer is washed with 25 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the solvent yields 12–12.5 g. of crude 4-bromo-N,N-dimethyl-3-(trifluoromethyl)aniline. Distillation through an 8-cm. Vigreux column provides 11–12 g. (82–90%) of pure bromoamine, b.p. 134–136° (15 mm.), which solidifies, giving colorless crystals, m.p. 29–30° and.
B. 2-Phenyl-2,3-dihydrofuran (2). A 500-mL, oven-dried Airfree® reaction flask containing a magnetic stir bar is charged with molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6, 3.21 g, 12.2 mmol) and fitted with a rubber septum, with an argon atmosphere introduced via the side-arm. Triethylamine (Et3N, 220 mL, 1.58 mol) is added, followed by diethyl ether (Et2O, 180 mL), and the mixture is stirred for 10-15 min, until the molybdenum hexacarbonyl has dissolved. The solution is placed in a Rayonet Photochemical Reactor Chamber equipped with 350-nm ultraviolet lamps. The septum is removed under positive argon pressure, and a reflux condenser bearing a rubber septum that has been previously flushed with argon is quickly fitted onto the Schlenk tube. The solution is irradiated for 1 hr under argon while the photochemical reactor interior is cooled with the built-in cooling fan. The light is turned off and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature while maintaining an inert atmosphere to afford a yellow solution of triethylamine-molybdenum pentacarbonyl . The condenser is removed and a septum is quickly refitted while under a positive flow of argon. A solution of 1-phenyl-3-butyn-1-ol (1, 13.50 g, 92.3 mmol) in diethyl ether (40 mL) is injected into the solution, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature under a slow argon stream for 72 hr; the solution slowly turns dark red over this period. The solvent is then removed by rotary evaporation, leaving a dark red liquid and a precipitate of molybdenum-containing by-products, which are removed by sublimation by heating under vacuum (35°C, 0.5 mm) The remaining liquid is vacuum distilled through a short-path distillation column (45-47°C, 0.5 mm) to give 2-phenyl-2,3-dihydrofuran (2, 10.3 g, 76% yield) as a clear liquid.
B. Phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (1). A 1-L 3-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 4-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 2-iodo-N-phenylbenzamide (7.0 g, 21.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv), 2,2'-azoisobutyryonitrile (AIBN) (0.77 g, 4.7 mmol, 0.2 equiv), potassium t-butoxide (12.0 g, 107 mmol, 5 equiv) and benzene (250 mL). The center neck is fitted with a reflux condenser equipped with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and gas bubbler. One outer neck is sealed with a glass stopper; the other neck is capped with a rubber septum through which a thermocouple probe is inserted. Using a heating mantle, the slurry is warmed to a gentle reflux (internal temp 81 °C) for 20 h. An additional portion of AIBN (50 mg, 0.3 mmol, 1.5 %) is added and the mixture refluxed for 5 h. The stir bar, reflux condenser and thermocouple probe are removed and the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (40 °C bath temp, 70 to 10 mmHg) to a tan powder (20 g). A 4-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar and water (150 mL) are added to the flask. The suspension is stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature then filtered through a 60-mL sintered glass funnel. Water (2 x 50 mL) is used to rinse the flask and wash the cake. The resulting solid is dried under vacuum (70 mmHg, 40 °C) for 20 h to afford a tan powder (4.04 g) .. The solid is transferred to a 200-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar. Methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) (40 mL) is added and the slurry is stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature then filtered through a 60-mL sintered glass funnel. The cake is washed with MTBE (2 x 8 mL) then dried under vacuum (70 mmHg, 40 °C) for 4 h to afford phenanthridin-6(5H)-one (1) as a tan powder (3.59 g, 85% yield).
B. 1-Cyclohexenylacetonitrile. The benzene solution is allowed to cool to about 50°, and the flask is attached to a Vigreux column. The benzene is removed under reduced pressure, whereupon the residual cyclohexylidenecyanoacetic acid solidifies. The flask is then heated slowly in an oil bath to 165–175° while the system is evacuated with a water pump to a pressure of 35–45 mm. (not lower). The acid melts, decarboxylation occurs very rapidly, and the crude 1-cyclohexenylacetonitrile distils at 100–120°/35–45 mm.
A. Hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid (1). A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and calcium chloride drying tube. Finely powdered hydroxylamine sulfate (26.0 g., 0.158 mole) is placed in the flask, and 60 ml. (107 g., 0.92 mole) of chlorosulfonic acid is added dropwise over 20 minutes with vigorous stirring. After the addition is complete, the flask, with stirring, is placed in a 100° oil bath for 5 minutes. The pasty mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the flask is placed in an ice bath. To the stirred mixture 200 ml. of diethyl ether is slowly added over 20–30 minutes. During the ether addition, the pasty contents change to a colorless powder which is collected by suction on a Büchner funnel. The powder is washed with 300 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, then with 200 ml. of ether. The product 1, after drying, weighs 34–35 g. (95–97%). Iodometric titration shows the product is 96–99% pure and adequate for the following reaction.
C. 3,5-Dibromosulfanilamide. The bromination of sulfanilamide is carried out in much the same way as the chlorination. The stirrer must be more efficient; a glass stirrer with two sets of blades is satisfactory if run at high speed. Fifty grams (0.29 mole) of sulfanilamide is dissolved in a mixture of 850 ml. of water and 100 ml. (0.68 mole) of 40% hydrobromic acid. The solution is heated as above, but to 70–75°, and 65 g. (59 ml., 0.58 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide is added and. A precipitate settles in 2–3 minutes, and the solution becomes yellow. The heat of reaction causes the internal temperature to rise without further application of heat to a maximum of 85–90° after 10 minutes; by the end of the reaction time the temperature will have fallen to about 70°. After a total reaction time of 30 minutes, during which the mixture has become almost solid and is very difficult to stir, the material is filtered hot. The yield of 3,5-dibromosulfanilamide is 85–90 g. (90–94%), and the crude tan product melts over a range of 1–2° in the region 230–237°.
B. (4S)-(−)-tert-Butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A dry, 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, is purged with nitrogen and charged with 11.7 g (45.6 mmol) of (1R,4S)-(−)-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate and 250 mL of anhydrous methanol to which 4.94 g (91.5 mmol) of powdered sodium methoxide is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min at ambient temperature, freed of most of the methanol using a rotary evaporator, and taken up in 400 mL of dichloromethane. The solution is washed with three 200-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator, giving 11.2 g of crude allylic alcohol which is carried into the next reaction without further purification.
A dry, 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas-inlet tube for nitrogen, a magnetic stirring bar, and a serum stopper, as described above, is flushed with nitrogen. While the flask is being flushed, 2.50 g. (0.00565 mole) of 3β-acetoxycholest-5-en-7-one and 0.0521 ml. (0.00289 mole) of water are added to the reaction flask. The flask is stoppered with a glass stopper and charged with 17 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. After the starting material has dissolved, the cold triethylaluminum-hydrogen cyanide solution is transferred to the reaction flask with a dry hypodermic syringe. The resulting pale yellow solution is stirred at room temperature under a positive nitrogen pressure. After 3 hours, a solution of 0.044 ml. (0.0024 mole) of water in 0.87 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added, and the solution is allowed to stir for an additional 4 hours.
The colorless dried oil is distilled through a 45-cm. Widmer column. Most of the methylene chloride is removed by heating the contents of the distillation pot to 75° at atmospheric pressure. The pressure is then lowered to about 20 mm., and 112–129 g. (75–87%) of dibromoacetonitrile is collected as a colorless oil, b.p. 70–72°/20 mm., nD25 1.540–1.542, d420 2.369 and.
A. N-[(1,1-Dimethylethoxy)carbonyl]-L-serine methyl ester. A solution of di-tert-butyl dicarbonate [(Boc)2O] (78.4 g, 0.36 mol,) in dioxane (280 mL,) is added to an ice-cold, magnetically stirred solution of L-serine (31.7 g, 0.30 mol,) in 1 N sodium hydroxide (620 mL) by means of an addition funnel. The two-phase mixture is stirred at 5°C for 30 min, then allowed to warm to room temperature over 3.5 hr at which time TLC analysis shows the reaction to be complete. The mixture is concentrated to half its original volume by rotary evaporation at 35°C, cooled in an ice-water bath, acidified to pH 2–3 by the slow addition of 1 N potassium bisulfate (620 mL), and then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 1000 mL). The combined extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give N-Boc-L-serine (63.0 g) as a colorless, sticky foam which is used without further purification.
Twelve grams of concentrated sulfuric acid is added to 180 g. (167 cc., 1.8 moles) of acetic anhydride in a 600-cc. beaker, after which 60 g. (0.55 mole) of quinone is added gradually in small portions with constant mechanical stirring. The temperature rises and should be held at 40–50° during the addition of the quinone. A temperature higher than 50° leads to decomposition of the product whereas a temperature lower than 40° causes a much slower reaction. Good temperature control can be obtained by using care in adding the quinone and by the use of a cooling bath and efficient stirring. The reaction goes smoothly and does not evolve an excessive amount of heat.
The cuprous cyanide, which begins to separate as a light tan precipitate as soon as any of the cyanide solution is added, is allowed to settle and the solution is decanted. The precipitate is filtered, then washed with water (1 l.) and finally with alcohol (500 cc.) and ether (300 cc.). After drying at 110° for about thirty-six hours, the product weighs 200–210 g. (85–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A separate flame-dried, 1-L, 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm) and two rubber septa is charged through the open neck with vinyl iodide 5 (6.25 g, 26.3 mmol, 1.2 equiv), cesium carbonate (7.14 g, 21.9 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and triphenylarsine (0.67 g, 2.2 mmol, 0.10 equiv). A third septum is added, the flask is evacuated (> 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and DMF (130 mL) is added via a 20-mL plastic syringe. The resulting suspension is sparged with argon for 15 min. Dichloro[1,1'-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]palladium(II)_dichloromethane adduct (Pd(dppf)Cl2_CH2Cl2) (0.80 g, 1.1 mmol, 0.05 equiv) is added quickly to the flask through an open neck, the septum is quickly replaced, and the resulting red suspension is sparged with argon for 15 min (during this time, the color of the solution changes from red-orange to brown). The resulting degassed suspension is then treated with the aforementioned hydroboration mixture via cannula over 10 min. Upon completion of the cannula transfer, the reaction vessel is evacuated (< 1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, and the dark brown reaction mixture is stirred for 5 h before it is poured onto 500 mL saturated NaCl in a 2 L separatory funnel. The organic phase is isolated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 x 300 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate (40 g), and the drying agent is removed via vacuum filtration through a Büchner funnel (150 mmHg). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give the product as a dark oil containing some residual DMF. Purification by flash chromatography on silica gel gives 7.12 g (88%) of acetonide 6 as a brown oil containing 7% (w/w) cyclooctanone.
B. N,N',N"-Tris(p-tolysulfonyl)diethylenetriamine-N,N"-disodium salt (2). A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and addition funnel is charged with 1 l. of absolute ethanol and 425 g. (0.752 mole) of triamine 1 under nitrogen. The stirred slurry is heated to reflux, the heat source is removed, and 1000 ml. of 1.5 N sodium ethoxide solution is added through the addition funnel as rapidly as possible. The solution is decanted from any undissolved residue into an Erlenmeyer flask. The disodium salt 2, which crystallizes on standing overnight, is filtered under nitrogen, washed with absolute ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven at 100°, yielding 400–440 g. (87–96%).
The reactions are carried out in 1-l. heavy-walled bottles provided with rubber stoppers which must be wired securely in place. In each of four bottles are placed 400 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (28–30% ammonia) and 100 ml. (80 g., 1.5 moles) of cold acrylonitrile. The rubber stoppers are immediately wired in place. Each bottle is then shaken intermittently until after about 5 minutes the reaction mixture becomes homogeneous. Thereupon, the bottle, wrapped in a towel, is immediately set away under a hood.
C. p-Bromodiphenylmethane. A 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a distillation condenser, a thermometer, and an efficient mechanical stirrer is charged with 1.1 l. of diethylene glycol and a solution of 190 g. of potassium hydroxide in 100 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred, and water is distilled until the internal temperature reaches 180°. The resulting solution is allowed to cool to 100° or below, and 146 g. (0.40 mole) of 1-p-bromophenyl-1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloroethane is added. The condenser is set for reflux, and the mixture is stirred and heated to boiling for 5 hours. The hot solution is then poured onto 3 kg. of cracked ice, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The oily layer is separated and dissolved in ether (any insoluble material is discarded), and the aqueous layer is extracted with 250 ml. of ether. The combined ethereal solution and extracts are dried over calcium chloride and filtered. The ether is removed under reduced pressure on a hot water bath. The product is distilled under reduced pressure; b.p. 120–130° (3 mm.), 155–163° (13 mm.), n24D 1.6028, d2424 1.342. The yield is 74–79 g. (75–80%).
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a 500-cc. separatory funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer, is placed a solution of 123 g. (1.5 moles) of cyclohexene in a mixture of 300 cc. of carbon tetrachloride and 15 cc. of absolute alcohol. The flask is surrounded by an ice-salt bath. The stirrer is started, and, when the temperature has reached −5°, a solution of 210 g. (67 cc., 1.3 moles) of bromine in 145 cc. of carbon tetrachloride is added from the separatory funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed −1°. The addition requires about three hours.
Benzylidenearginine, Method 2.—The hydrolysis of 500 g. of gelatine and the removal of excess hydrochloric acid are conducted as described above. After treatment with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon the filtrate is diluted to 2.5 l., heated almost to boiling, and treated with 110 g. of 2,4-dinitro-1-naphthol-7-sulfonic acid ("flavianic acid") dissolved in 400 cc. of hot water. The mixture is boiled for about three minutes and diluted with boiling water to a total volume of 4 l. The mixture is cooled rapidly to 45° and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, with occasional stirring and vigorous scratching of the walls of the container. After standing for about two hours at room temperature, practically all the arginine dinitronaphtholsulfonate should have separated in crystalline, readily filterable form. The product is filtered by suction and washed first with three 100-cc. portions of a 0.5 per cent solution of dinitronaphtholsulfonic acid and then with two 25-cc. portions of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. After being dried in air, the product weighs 113–118 g.; it decomposes at 245–265°.
The addition of the methyl bromide consumes about four hours. The reaction proceeds smoothly and with evolution of heat, occasionally reaching the boiling point of the mixture. During the course of the reaction sodium bromide separates. When the addition of methyl bromide is complete, the solution is pale orange and faintly alkaline. It is boiled for an additional half-hour then neutralized with glacial acetic acid and cooled. The sodium bromide is filtered with suction and washed on the funnel with a little cold alcohol. The major part of the alcohol is then removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The sodium bromide is dissolved in 600–700 cc. of water containing 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The resulting solution is added to the residue from the distillation and the mixture shaken well. The aqueous lower layer is separated from the ester and extracted twice with ether. The ester and ether extracts are combined and dried by shaking quickly with calcium chloride and filtering immediately. The ether is removed, and the ester is shaken for exactly one minute with a cold solution of 10 g. of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water. The alkali is drawn off; the ester is washed with dilute acid and dried as before with calcium chloride. It is then distilled in vacuo, and the fraction boiling at 96°/16 mm. is taken. There is almost no fore-run or residue. The yield is 275–290 g. (79–83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The enolate solution is added slowly with cooling and vigorous stirring so that the temperature of the reaction mixture remains below 30°. After all the supernatant enolate solution has been transferred, the residual slurry of sodium hydride is washed with an additional 50-ml. portion of anhydrous 1,2-dimethoxyethane; these washings are also added to the acetic anhydride solution. The resulting viscous mixture is stirred at room temperature for an additional 30 minutes and poured cautiously into a mixture of 500 ml. of pentane, 500 ml. of water, and 130 g. (1.54 moles) of sodium hydrogen carbonate. When hydrolysis of the excess acetic anhydride and neutralization of the acetic acid are complete, the pentane layer is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 100 ml. of pentane. The combined pentane solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residual orange liquid through a 20–30-cm. Vigreux column provides 61.7–80.6 g. (73–95%) of 2-acetoxy-trans-1-phenylpropene, b.p. 82–89° (1 mm.), nD25 1.5320–1.5327.
Most of the acetone is removed from the combined aqueous layers by distillation. Upon acidification with concentrated hydrochloric acid a thick precipitate forms. Filtration and drying leads to 106 g of almost colorless 2-toluic acid, mp 103–107°C. This material is of sufficient purity for conversion into the acid chloride and for subsequent flash vacuum pyrolysis.
A. 2-Phenyl-1,3-dithiane. A 100 ml., two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a gas-inlet tube and a drying tube containing glass wool is charged with 5.52 g. (5.28 ml., 0.0521 mole) of benzaldehyde, 5.6 g. (5.2 ml., 0.052 mole) of 1,3-propanedithiol, and 30 ml. of chloroform. The flask is immersed in an ice bath, and a slow stream of hydrogen chloride gas is bubbled through the solution. When saturated (after ca. 5 minutes), the reaction mixture is left at room temperature for 30 minutes, then evaporated at reduced pressure. The oily residue is taken up in 50 ml. of methanol and vigorously agitated to induce crystallization. The crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ligroin, and air dried. By condensing the mother liquors, two more crops may be obtained, giving a total of 9.5–9.7 g. (93–95%) of 2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane, m.p. 69–70°.
After the addition of the bromine is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for about one hour. It then has a light yellow color. The solution is washed with water and then with two 500-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide solution to remove any dissolved hydrobromic acid. The solution is dried over calcium chloride and filtered. The carbon tetrachloride is distilled through a good column until the temperature at the top of the column reaches about 120°. When the carbon tetrachloride has distilled, the oil is likely to turn dark and give off fumes.
A solution of 600 g. (4.9 moles) of isopropyl bromide in 300 cc. of dry ether is then added through the separatory funnel. The reaction begins after about 15 cc. of the solution has been added. The solution is added at such a rate that the reaction mixture refluxes gently. It is well to arrange to cool the flask with running water if the refluxing becomes too vigorous. The addition of the isopropyl bromide solution should require from three and one-half to four hours. The reaction mixture is refluxed on the water bath for forty minutes after addition of the isopropyl bromide solution is complete.
A 2-l., two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser is charged with 40.0 g. (0.232 mole) of 4-cyanobenzenesulfonamide, 600 ml. of 75% (v/v) formic acid, and 40 g. of Raney nickel alloy. The stirred mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. The mixture is filtered with suction through a Büchner funnel coated with a filter aid, and the residue is washed with two 160-ml. portions of 95% ethanol. The combined filtrates are evaporated with a rotary evaporator. The solid residue is dissolved in 400 ml. of boiling water and freed from a small amount of insoluble material by decantation through a plug of glass wool placed in a filter funnel. The filtrate is chilled in an ice bath, and the precipitate is collected by filtration with suction, washed with a small amount of cold water, and dried at 50° under vacuum, yielding about 32 g. of crude product, m.p. 112–114°.
B. Methyl 4-acetoxybenzoate. A 100-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask is charged with 1.63 g. (0.0110 mole) of trimethyloxonium tetrafluoborate and, 75 ml. of dichloromethane and, and 1.80 g. (0.0100 mole) of 4-acetoxybenzoic acid. A magnetic stirring bar is added, and the suspension is stirred while 1.4 g. (1.9 ml., 0.011 mole) of diisopropylethylamine is introduced with a syringe. The flask is then stoppered, and stirring is continued at room temperature for 16–24 hours, during which time the oxonium salt dissolves. Work-up exactly as that described in Part A is followed by bulb-to-bulb distillation at about 140° (5 mm.), yielding 1.65–1.84 g. (85–95%) of methyl 4-acetoxybenzoate, m.p. 78–80°.
After removal of the ether by distillation on a steam bath, the residue is distilled under diminished pressure from a Claisen flask. The yield of p-chlorobenzaldehyde distilling at 108–111°/25 mm. and melting at 46–47° is 76–84 g. (54–60 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After the mixture has been allowed to stand at room temperature for at least an hour, a few grams of clean sand is added and the dark red mixture is filtered with suction. The filtrate is extracted with ether (100 ml., then 4–5 portions of about 30 ml. each), and each extract is used in turn to extract the filter cake.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, attached to an efficient reflux condenser and set in a hot water bath, are placed 222 g. (1.72 moles) of selenious acid, 270 ml. of paraldehyde, 540 ml. of dioxane, and 40 ml. of 50% acetic acid, and the mixture is refluxed for 6 hours. The solution is then decanted from the inorganic material, which is washed with two 150-ml. portions of water. The combined solutions are steam-distilled through a still head (p. 65) until the paraldehyde and dioxane have been removed; this requires about 3.5 hours. The mixture is decanted from a little selenium, and to the solution, without filtration, is added a slight excess of 25% lead acetate solution and. The lead selenite is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is saturated with hydrogen sulfide in a hood. Then 20 g. of Norit is added; the whole is warmed to 40° in a hood and filtered with suction. The water-clear solution is concentrated on a hot water bath under reduced pressure to about 150 ml. in the usual apparatus.
During the additions, which require about two hours, the dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine separates as a supernatant liquid; the semisolid material thrown up on the sides of the flask must be washed down from time to time. After being heated for one-half hour longer the mixture is allowed to cool. The solid dibenzoyldimethylhydrazine is collected, crushed with water, filtered, and dissolved in 100 cc. of chloroform. The solution is filtered from insoluble impurities and dried over sodium sulfate; the chloroform is removed by heating on a water bath, finally under reduced pressure. The solid residue melts at 77–84° and is sufficiently pure for further use. The yield is 77–83 g. (86–93 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. (R)-(+)-1,1,2-Triphenylethanediol. A solution of methyl (R)-(−)-mandelate (92.3 g, 0.556 mol) in ether (500 mL) is added dropwise to the cold solution of phenylmagnesium bromide prepared in Step A at a rate such that the temperature does not rise above 10°C (1.25 hr required). The mixture is then allowed to stir an additional 2 hr with cooling (final temp 6°C) before heating to reflux. After 3 hr at reflux the solution is allowed to stand overnight at ambient temperature under nitrogen. The solution (CAUTION: Contains benzene) is poured onto 1 kg of ice contained in a 5-L, round-bottomed flask placed in an ice bath and equipped with an overhead stirrer and reflux condenser. A solid mass results that is broken up with a spatula so that it is partly stirrable. Hydrochloric acid (6 N, 516 mL) is added dropwise, while monitoring the pH, to a pH of 3.9. The two-phase, liquid mixture is stirred for 1 hr at ambient temperature. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with methylene chloride (CH2Cl2) (3 × 250 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated to a thick caramel-like oil (179 g). Methanol (300 mL) is added causing crystallization and the mixture is heated to reflux to give a clear yellow solution. The solution is allowed to cool to room temperature over several hours. It is then cooled in an ice bath to 0°C and aged for 1 hr. The product is collected on a filter and washed with cold (−10°C) methanol (200 mL). The solid is dried under reduced pressure at 50°C (106.6 g, 66%), mp 123–127°C, [α]20D +220° (95% ethanol, c 1). Liquid chromatographic (LC) analysis shows 96.6% purity with 3.2% benzoin contamination (area %, uncorrected for relative response).
To 2750 g. (2 l., 13.6 moles) of 40 per cent hydrobromic acid in a 3-l. flask is added 317 g. (4.5 moles) of ethylene cyanohydrin (p. 256), and the mixture is boiled for two hours under a reflux condenser. The condenser is then arranged for downward distillation and a thermometer immersed in the reaction mixture; dilute hydrobromic acid is distilled off until the temperature in the flask reaches 121°, whereupon the receiver is changed and a fraction consisting of stronger hydrobromic acid is collected over the range 121–129°. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 129°, very little hydrobromic acid remains, and on cooling, the mass sets to an almost colorless solid. This is now dissolved in 2000 cc. of carbon tetrachloride, and the ammonium bromide is filtered off and washed with 500 cc. more of the solvent; a thin aqueous layer is separated and 1500 cc. of the carbon tetrachloride distilled from the filtrate. On cooling, about 470 g. of β-bromopropionic acid crystallizes from the residue; on filtering and drying, this melts at 62.5–63.5°. With further concentration, the mother liquor yields a second crop of β-bromopropionic acid, amounting to 60–70 g.
B. 2-tert-Pentylcyclopentanone. A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a gas inlet, a gas bubbler, rubber septum, and magnetic stirrer. The apparatus is flushed with dry nitrogen or argon and charged with 120 mL of dry dichloromethane, 15.6 g (0.10 mol) of 1-trimethylsiloxycyclopentene and 11.7 g (0.11 mol) of 2-chloro-2-methylbutane. The mixture is cooled to −50°C and a cold (−50°C) solution of 11 mL (0.10 mol) of titanium tetrachloride in 20 mL of dichloromethane is added within 2 min through the rubber septum with the aid of a syringe. During this operation rapid stirring and cooling in maintained. Sunlight should be avoided. The reddish-brown mixture is stirred at the given temperature for an additional 2.5 hr and is then rapidly poured into 1 L of ice–water. After the addition of 400 mL of dichloromethane, the mixture is vigorously shaken in a separatory funnel; the organic phase is separated and washed twice with 400-mL portions of water. The aqueous phase of the latter two washings is extracted with 200 mL of dichloromethane; the organic phases are combined and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The mixture is concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled at 80°C (12 mm) to yield 9.2–9.5 g (60–62%) of 2-tert-pentylcyclopentanone as a colorless oil.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, is placed 518 g. (643 cc., 7 moles) of dry isobutyl alcohol (b.p. 106–108°). The alcohol is cooled to −10° by immersing the flask in an ice-salt bath, and 695 g. (244 cc., 2.56 moles) of phosphorus tribromide is slowly added with stirring at such a rate as to keep the temperature below 0° (about four hours). The cooling bath is removed, and stirring is continued until the mixture reaches room temperature; it is then allowed to stand overnight. The stirrer, funnel, and thermometer are removed, and the flask is fitted with a 30-cm. fractionating column and a condenser. The crude isobutyl bromide is distilled from the reaction mixture under diminished pressure, e.g., at about 50°/200 mm..
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser are placed 210 g. (1 mole) of powdered citric acid monohydrate and a solution of 210 g. (115 cc., 2 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 105 cc. of water. The mixture is heated in an oil bath kept at a temperature of 140–145° for seven hours. The light brown solution is poured into a shallow dish, and the flask is rinsed with 10 cc. of hot glacial acetic acid. The liquid is allowed to cool slowly to 41–42°, with occasional stirring to break up the solid mass of aconitic acid which separates, and the solid is collected on a suction funnel. The material is pressed and drained thoroughly until practically dry, when it is removed and stirred to a homogeneous paste with 70 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, cooled in an ice bath. The solid is collected on a suction funnel, washed with two 10-cc. portions of cold glacial acetic acid, sucked thoroughly, and spread out in a thin layer on porous plate or paper for final drying. This product contains practically no sulfate and is pure enough for most purposes. It is colorless, and when dry weighs 71–77 g. (41–44 per cent of the theoretical amount). The point of decomposition determined under controlled conditions varies from 180° to 200°.
A 500-ml., two-necked, creased flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar and connected to an atmospheric pressure hydrogenation apparatus equipped with a graduated burette to measure the uptake of hydrogen, is charged with 0.9 g. (0.9 × 10−3 mole) of freshly prepared tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium chloride and 160 ml. of benzene. One neck is stoppered with a serum cap, and the mixture is stirred magnetically until the solution is homogeneous. The system is then evacuated and filled with hydrogen. Using a syringe, 10 g. (0.066 mole) of carvone is introduced into the hydrogenation flask. The syringe is rinsed with two, 10-ml. portions of benzene, and stirring is resumed. Hydrogen uptake starts immediately and stops 3.5 hours later when the theoretical amount of hydrogen has been absorbed. The solution is filtered through a dry column (4 cm. diameter) of 120 g. of Florisil (60–100 mesh). The column is washed with 300 ml. of diethyl ether, and the combined solvent fractions are concentrated under reduced pressure. Vacuum distillation of the yellow residue through an 11-cm. Vigreux column affords 9.1–9.5 g. (90–94%) of dihydrocarvone; b.p. 100–102° (14 mm.), n24D 1.479 and.
Two liters of water is heated to boiling in a 3-l. flask. Mean-while 50 g. (0.53 mole) of phenol, in a 250-cc. tall beaker provided with a small glass mechanical stirrer, is heated to 170° on an electric heater. The heat is then turned off and 100 g. (0.31 mole) of powdered mercuric acetate is added gradually (five to ten minutes) to the stirred phenol. After all of the mercuric acetate has dissolved in the phenol, the mercuration mixture is poured slowly into the hot water, the burner having previously been removed. The beaker is rinsed out with some of the hot water. The mixture is boiled for five minutes and then filtered through filter paper in a large Büchner funnel which has been previously heated by blowing steam through it. The pink residue consists of a small amount of dimercurated phenol and some polymerization products.
C. (R)-(+)-N,N-Dibenzyl-N-(1-cyclohexyl-2-propynyl)-amine. (R)-(+)-N,N-Dibenzyl-N-[1-cyclohexyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynyl]-amine (390 mg, 1.00 mmol), placed in a 25-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum, is dissolved in dry THF (5 mL). The solution is cooled to 0 °C for 10 min and Bu4NF (0.30 mmol, 0.30 mL, 1 M solution in THF) shows full conversion. The reaction mixture is quenched with water (30 mL), and the aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation (55 °C, 760 mmHg, then 38 mmHg). The resulting light yellow oil is purified by column chromatography affording N,N-dibenzyl-N-(1-cyclohexyl-2-propynyl)-amine (307 mg, 0.97 mmol) as a clear, colorless oil. (97%).
The Wood's metal bath is allowed to cool to about 75° and the reaction mixture is subjected to distillation under reduced pressure, using a water pump. The temperature of the bath is increased slowly and distillation is continued, with a water pump, until the bath reaches a temperature of about 125°. The bath is again cooled to 75–80° and the distillation is continued at lower pressure, using an oil pump.
The flask is charged through serum cap B with 17 mL (120 mmol) of diisopropylamine and 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF), using syringe techniques. It is cooled to −75°C in a dry ice bath. With stirring, exactly 100 mmol of butyllithium (hexane solution) is introduced from the dropping funnel within 10 min, followed after 0.5 hr, by a mixture of 9.51 g (50 mmol) of ( − )-diethyl (S)-malate and 5 mL of THF, which is added dropwise through cap B at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above −60°C. The addition takes approximately 10 min. The dry ice cooling bath is replaced by an ice–salt bath (ca. −15°C) in which the contents of the flask warm to −20°C within 0.5 hr. The solution is stirred at −20°C ± 2°C for 0.5 hr and then is cooled to −75°C.
(B) Methylhydrazine Sulfate.—Two hundred grams (0.96 mole) of benzalazine, 350 cc. of dry, thiophene-free benzene, and 100 cc. (133 g., 1.05 moles) of methyl sulfate are mixed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride tube. The mixture is heated continuously, with occasional shaking, on a water bath to gentle refluxing for five hours. The mixture is cooled, and the solid addition product is decomposed by adding 600 cc. of water and shaking until all the solid material has disappeared. The benzene and benzaldehyde are removed by steam distillation; the residual liquor, after cooling, is treated with 15–20 cc. of benzaldehyde and left overnight. The resin and benzalazine are separated by filtration.
A. α-Bromo-γ-butyrolactone. In a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a dropping funnel, sealed stirrer, and an efficient reflux condenser are placed 100 g. (1.16 moles) of redistilled γ-butyrolactone and 13.4 g. (0.43 g. atom) of red phosphorus. Over a half-hour interval, 195 g. (66.5 ml., 1.22 moles) of bromine is added, the mixture being stirred moderately and cooled by an ice bath.
A. Acetone azine. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask containing 145 g. (183 ml., 2.50 moles) of acetone is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel and cooled in an ice bath. With vigorous stirring, 65.5 g. (1.31 moles) of 100% hydrazine hydrate is added at such a rate that the temperature is maintained below 35°. The addition takes 20–30 minutes. The mixture is stirred for an additional 10–15 minutes before 50 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets is added with vigorous stirring and continued cooling. The upper liquid layer is separated and allowed to stand over 25 g. of potassium hydroxide pellets for 30 minutes, with occasional swirling. After filtration, the liquid is further dried with two successive 12.5-g. portions of potassium hydroxide. Distillation gives 120–126 g. (86–90%) of almost colorless acetone azine, b.p. 128–131°, nD22 1.4538.
The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 21 hr at room temperature (about 30°C). Under vigorous stirring, 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, 100 mL of water, and 300 mL of ether are added to the mixture. The organic layer is separated and the water layer is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether solution is condensed using a rotary evaporator and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure to give 14.5–16.0 g (88–97% yield) of isopropylideneacetophenone.
A solution of potassium hydroxide is prepared by dissolving 122 g. (2.2 moles; 1.5 times the theoretical amount) of potassium hydroxide in 700 cc. of 95 per cent methyl alcohol contained in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a reflux condenser. To this alkaline solution is added 100 g. (0.36 mole) of α,β-dibromosuccinic acid (p. 177), and the mixture is refluxed for one hour and fifteen minutes on a steam bath. The reaction mixture is cooled and filtered with suction. The mixed salts are washed with 200 cc. of methyl alcohol and dried by pressing between filter papers; when dry the product weighs 144–150 g.
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask, 50 g. (0.44 mole) of 2-ketohexamethylenimine (p. 371) is added to a solution of 45 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) in 150 cc. of water. The solution is boiled for about one hour until it becomes clear and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure on a steam bath.
(A) Dinitrodurene.—A solution of 13.4 g. (0.1 mole) and of durene (p. 248) in 100 cc. of chloroform is added to 75 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in an 800-cc. beaker provided with a thermometer and an efficient mechanical stirrer. The mixture is cooled to 10°, and 16 g. (10.7 cc.) of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.5) is added drop by drop, with stirring, from a 125-cc. separatory funnel, the mixture being cooled in an ice-salt bath and the nitric acid added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 50° (about fifteen minutes is required for the addition). As soon as all the acid has been added the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, the sulfuric acid layer is removed, and the upper chloroform layer is immediately run into 500 cc. of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution. The sulfuric acid layer is discarded because it contains very little dinitrodurene. Four portions are nitrated, and the combined chloroform solutions are washed twice with 2.5 per cent sodium carbonate solution, dried overnight with 30 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and the chloroform distilled until crystals of dinitrodurene begin to appear. At this point four times the volume of hot 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added (about 500 cc.), and the resulting mixture is cooled to 10°. The solid is filtered and washed twice with 50 cc. of cold (10°) 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The yield from four nitrations is 82.5–84 g. (92–94 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 207–208°.
(B) Triphenylselenonium Chloride.—To 87 g. (100 cc., 1.1 moles) of benzene in a 1-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, is added 30 g. (0.22 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride. The suspension is cooled in an ice bath, and to it is added, with stirring, 40 g. (0.13 mole) of diphenylselenium dichloride in portions of approximately 1 g. at a time over a period of twenty-five minutes. Before each addition the temperature should be below 10° to prevent the final product from becoming dark. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for three hours at room temperature, and then 200 cc. of water is added cautiously. The benzene layer is separated and discarded. If the water layer is colored, further extractions with benzene will remove most of the color without reducing the yield. The water layer is then extracted three times with 50-cc. portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are concentrated to a volume of 40 cc. and treated with 120 cc. of ether. A yellow oil precipitates and solidifies almost at once to a white powder. The triphenylselenonium chloride is collected on a filter and recrystallized from 300 cc. of methyl ethyl ketone to which 20 cc. of water has been added. The yield of anhydrous product, after drying at 100°, is 30 g. (67 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 2-Cyclopentene-1-acetamide. A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, 25-mL pressure equalizing addition funnel, and an argon atmosphere with provision for venting gaseous reaction products. The vessel is charged with 20 g (152 mmol) of 2-cyclopentene-1-acetic acid and 25 mL of dry toluene. Oxalyl chloride (17.3 mL, 1.3 equiv) is added slowly over a 30-min period by means of the addition funnel, taking care to release any pressure buildup. (Caution: gaseous hydrogen chloride evolution!.) The dark reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min while the second reaction vessel is assembled, then concentrated to about 2/3 volume at the vacuum pump.
C. (E)-1-Menthoxy-1-butene. A dry, 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-covered magnetic stirring bar, is flushed with argon and charged with 7.65 g (202 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride and 325 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and then capped with a rubber septum and connected by means of a syringe needle to an argon-filled balloon. To the stirred slurry is added dropwise by syringe neat 1-menthoxy-1-butyne (14.0 g, 67.2 mmol), followed by 2 mL of tetrahydrofuran wash. The septum is replaced with a reflux condenser connected to an argon-filled balloon and the mixture is refluxed for 4 hr. After the flask is allowed to cool to room temperature, it is placed in an ice bath and the reaction mixture is quenched by the slow addition (CAUTION!) of 12.5 mL of aqueous 10 % sodium hydroxide, followed by 15.5 mL of water. The resulting mixture is stirred for 30 min, after which anhydrous sodium sulfate (ca. 60 g) is added and the solid material is removed by filtration through a 1-cm pad of Celite, which is then rinsed with diethyl ether (4 × 100 mL) . Concentration of the combined filtrates yields 14.7 g of a pale yellow oil, which is purified by filtration through a 4-cm (80-g) pad of silica gel pretreated with triethylamine (2.5% v/v,) using hexane as the eluant. Concentration gives 13.3 g (94%) of (E)-1-menthoxy-1-butene as a colorless oil.
The combined filtrates are returned to the reaction vessel, and distillation with stirring is continued until virtually all the ethanol has been removed. The distillation is stopped when crystals of p-dithiane appear in the condenser or when dilution of the distillate with water causes a milky appearance or the formation of a small quantity of crystals. One liter of water is added to the residue, and the stirred mixture is distilled, using the apparatus of Fig. 8, until no more p-dithiane solidifies in the condenser.
The moist phenylhydroxylamine obtained from 1 kg. (8.1 moles) of nitrobenzene, by the procedure described on p. 445, is weighed and dissolved in 4.5 l. of ordinary ether. The ether-insoluble material (sodium chloride and water) is also weighed, the difference between the two weighings being a fairly accurate measure of the amount of phenylhydroxylamine in solution.
B. 2-Mercapto-4-hydroxy-5-cyanopyrimidine. The aqueous filtrate from which the crude 2-mercapto-4-amino-5-carbethoxypyrimidine separated is cooled overnight at 0°, and the cyanopyrimidine that precipitates is collected on a suction filter. The crude product is recrystallized from about 200 ml. of 10% acetic acid with 1 g. of decolorizing charcoal added. Two additional recrystallizations done similarly give the pure cyanopyrimidine as faintly yellow crystals, m.p. 265–272° (dec.). The yield is 10–18 g. (7–12%).
To the solid residue of sodium formylacetone remaining in the flask are added a solution of 67 g. (0.8 mole) of cyanoacetamide in 400 ml. of water and piperidine acetate (prepared by adding piperidine to 8 ml. of glacial acetic acid in 20 ml. of water until the solution is just basic to litmus). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours. At the end of this time 200 ml. of water is added, and the solution is acidified (to litmus) with acetic acid, causing separation of the product as a voluminous yellow precipitate. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath for 2 hours, and the product is collected on a suction filter, washed on the filter with three 100-ml. portions of ice water, and dried. The yield of 3-cyano-6-methyl-2(1)-pyridone is 59–67 g. (55–62%); m.p. 292–294° (dec., cor.),, and.
The mixture is allowed to cool and is then filtered. The filtrate is rendered distinctly acid to Congo red with hydrochloric acid and again distilled with steam. The oil so obtained is separated and distilled under normal pressure with the use of a fractionating column. The fraction boiling at 180–190° is redistilled, and the pure compound is collected at 184–186°. The yield is 523–531 g. (86–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 3,4-Dihydro-2-methylene-2H-1-benzopyran. Formation of the exo-methylene enol ether with dihydrocoumarin is carried out as in the foregoing procedure except that the reaction solution is cooled with a dry ice–acetone bath before addition of the lactone. From 3.0 g (20 mmol) of dihydrocoumarin is obtained 1.85–1.97 g (63–67%) of the product as a pale-yellow oil, after column chromatography on basic alumina (150 g) eluting with 5% diethyl ether in pentane.
Upon cooling to room temperature, a gray precipitate forms and the reaction is quenched with 220 mL of saturated, aqueous ammonium chloride. The resulting mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with 220 mL of diethyl ether. The organic fraction is washed two times with 100 mL of water, and once with 100 mL of brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide 44.1 g of crude product as a pale yellow oil. Purification of this material by bulb-to-bulb distillation (140–145°C, 0.5 mm) into a chilled (−78°C) receiving flask yields 41.0 g (92%) of 2 as a clear, colorless oil.
In a 1-l. modified Claisen flask, the side arm of which is corked, is placed a mixture of 202 g. (1 mole) of sebacic acid, 150 g. (0.58 mole) of diethyl sebacate, 50 cc. of di-n-butyl ether, and 30 g. (25 cc.) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). A reflux condenser is connected to the top of the distilling flask.
A. 1-Trimethylsilyloxycyclohexene. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube, and a rubber septum is charged with 100 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide and 60.6 g. (0.600 mole) of triethylamine. The solution is stirred while 32.6 g. (0.300 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane and 24.5 g. (0.250 mole) of cyclohexanone are injected in succession through the septum into the flask. The resulting mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 6 hours, cooled to room temperature, and diluted with 300 ml. of pentane. The triethylamine hydrochloride that precipitates is removed by filtering through a coarse, sintered-glass Büchner funnel, and the filter cake is washed with three 100-ml. portions of pentane. The filtrates are combined and washed with three 300-ml. portions of ice-cold sodium hydrogen carbonate solution. The organic layer is washed rapidly with 100 ml. of ice-cold 3% hydrochloric acid and 100 ml. of ice-cold sodium hydrogen carbonate in succession. The pentane solution is washed with 50 ml. of sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated. The residual liquid is distilled at reduced pressure through a 10-cm. Vigreux column, affording, after separation of a small forerun, 33–35.5 g. (78–84%) of 1-trimethylsilyloxycyclohexene, b.p. 74–75° (20 mm.) ((Note 4)).
B. (S)-3-(tert-Butyloxycarbonylamino)-4-phenylbutanoic acid . A 500-mL, three-necked flask is equipped with a nitrogen gas inlet, bubble counter, septum and a magnetic stirring bar. The flask is carefully wrapped in aluminum foil (to exclude light during the reaction). The crude diazo ketone from the preceding step is dissolved in tetrahydrofuran (380 mL, Note 10) and added to the flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen. De-ionized water (38 mL) is added, the flask is immersed in a dry ice-acetone bath, and the solution is cooled to −25°C (temperature of the acetone cooling bath) for 30 min. Silver trifluoroacetate (2.72 g, 12.3 mmol, Note 11) is placed in a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask and quickly dissolved in triethylamine (39 mL, 279 mmol, Note 3). The resulting solution is added to the diazo ketone solution in one portion (via syringe). The solution is allowed to warm to room temperature overnight. Evolution of nitrogen starts at a bath temperature of about −15°C.
A 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, is charged with the 11.2 g of crude allylic alcohol obtained above and 300 mL of dichloromethane, and the resulting vigorously stirred solution is treated with 33 g of active manganese dioxide (380 mmol). Additional 2–5 g lots of the oxidant are added every 2–3 hr until the reaction is complete. The reaction mixture is vacuum-filtered through a pad of diatomaceous earth, and the pad is washed with 200 mL of dichloromethane. The resulting clear filtrate is concentrated carefully using a rotary evaporator, and the residual oil is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation at 0.3 mm (pot temperature 100°C) affording 8.43–8.71 g (87–90%) of enone as a pale yellow oil that solidifies when cooled below 15°C. Crystallization of the crude product from pentane at −70°C gives (4S)-(−)-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one as colorless needles having mp 32–33°C, [α]D23 −65.1° (CH3OH, c 0.94).
The stopper of the flask is quickly replaced with the nitrogen adaptor, and after placing the system under a nitrogen atmosphere, the diethylaluminum cyanide is treated with 130 ml. of dry benzene. The resulting mixture is allowed to stand with occasional swirling under nitrogen until the syrup goes into solution. Sufficient dry benzene is then added to make the total volume of the solution 200 ml. After thorough mixing with a magnetic stirring bar, the resulting diethylaluminum cyanide solution (13.4–17.8%; 1.2–1.6 M) may be divided and stored in sealed ampoules.
The combined carbon tetrachloride layers are shaken with 110 ml. of 15N ammonium hydroxide, and the crystalline ammonium 1-adamantanecarboxlate that separates is collected on a Büchner funnel having a coarse fritted disk. The salt is washed with 20 ml. of cold acetone and suspended in 250 ml. of water. The suspension is made strongly acidic with 25 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid and extracted with 100 ml. of chloroform. The chloroform layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The residue is crude 1-adamantanecarboxylic acid; weight 12–13 g. (67–72%); m.p. 173–174°. Recrystallization of this product from a mixture of 30 ml. of methanol and about 10 ml. of water gives 10–11 g. (56–61%) of pure acid, m.p. 175–176.5°.
The crystalline dipentanoate (89–102 g, 0.20 mol) is dissolved in 1 L of methanol containing 6.6 g (0.12 mol) of sodium methoxide. After 4 hr at room temperature, analysis of the solution by thin layer chromatography shows only traces of the mono- and diester. The solution is neutralized to pH <7 (test paper) with ~10 mL of concd hydrochloric acid. The solution is diluted with 1 L of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7), transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and extracted with a mixture of 1 L of ethyl ether and 500 mL of toluene. The organic layer is washed with a 1-L portion of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, concentrated to 300 mL and cooled to 4°C. White crystals (48–64 g) separate and are collected by filtration and washed twice with 20-mL portions of cold toluene, mp 211–213.5°C; [α]D19 +33.9 ± 0.2° (THF, c 0.2); 99% chemical purity, >99% enantiomeric purity.
A 250-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is set up for conducting a reaction in an atmosphere of nitrogen by fitting into the top of the condenser a T-tube attached to a low-pressure supply of nitrogen and to a mercury bubbler. In the flask are placed 41 g. (0.50 mole) of cyclohexene and 0.05 g. (0.00035 mole) of cuprous bromide, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 80–82°. When the temperature of the mixture reaches that of the oil bath, 40 g. (0.21 mole) of t-butyl perbenzoate is added dropwise with stirring over a 1-hour period, during which the color of the now homogeneous solution becomes blue. Stirring and heating are continued for an additional 3.5 hours. The cooled reaction mixture is washed with two 50-ml. portions of dilute aqueous sodium carbonate to remove benzoic acid. The remaining organic phase is washed with water until neutral and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The excess of cyclohexene is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled through a short Vigreux column to give 29–33 g. (71–80%) of 3-benzoyloxycyclohexene, b.p. 97–99° (0.15 mm.), n20D 1.5376–1.5387.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a small glass paddle stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 101 g. (0.4 mole) of β-methyl-β-phenyl-α,α'-dicyanoglutarimide (p. 662), and a mixture of 500 ml. of water, 500 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 400 ml. of glacial acetic acid. Without starting the stirrer, the mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours. Then the stirrer is cautiously started, and reflux is continued for a total of 80 hours. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 6-l. Erlenmeyer flask, 3 l. of water is added and the mixture cooled in a refrigerator overnight. The precipitated acid is filtered by suction, washed with 100 ml. of water, and air-dried to constant weight. The crude, dry product is swirled for 5 minutes with 200 ml. of benzene, filtered by suction, washed with two 100-ml. portions of benzene, and again air-dried. The yield of acid, m.p. 136–140°, is 64.5–68 g. (72.5–76.5%) and.
The filtrate, which should be colorless, is concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure (Fig. 23) until crystalline material begins to separate. The liquor, amounting to approximately 3 l., is heated on the steam bath at atmospheric pressure and filtered with suction while hot, any crystals remaining on the filter being washed through by aspiration of wet steam. The filtrate is allowed to stand in the refrigerator overnight and the first crop of crystals filtered off. This weighs approximately 300 g. and melts at about 237° (corr.). The mother liquor is concentrated to approximately 2 l. and a second crop obtained as above; this weighs 60–70 g. and melts at 242° (corr.). A third crop of 50–60 g. melting at 249° (corr.) is obtained by concentrating the mother liquor to 1.2 l. The mother liquor is finally concentrated to a sirup, when a fourth crop weighing about 10 g. and melting at 248° (corr.) is obtained.
B. 2-Cyano-6-methylpyridine. In a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing, dropping funnel without a stopper, and a thermometer-gas inlet adapter fitted with a thermometer which reaches deep into the flask is placed a solution of 147 g. (3.0 mole) of sodium cyanide dissolved in 400 ml. of water. The stirrer is started and the apparatus is flushed with prepurified nitrogen for 1 hour. The solution in the flask is then cooled to 0° with an ice bath, and a solution of 235 g. (1.0 mole) of 1-methoxy-2-methylpyridinium methyl sulfate dissolved in 300 ml. of water is added dropwise over a period of 2 hours. The dropping funnel and the thermometer-adapter are then quickly removed and replaced by stoppers, and the flask is allowed to stand in a refrigerator overnight (12–16 hours). The flask, containing needles of the crude nitrile, is removed from the refrigerator and the contents stirred at room temperature for 6 hours. After addition of 200 ml. of chloroform, the contents of the flask are transferred to a large separatory funnel and the layers separated. Extraction of the aqueous phase is repeated twice with 100-ml. portions of chloroform, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent by filtration, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to remove chloroform, and the residual crude cyanopicoline (90–110 g.) is transferred, while hot, to a distilling flask. Distillation under reduced pressure (30 mm.) gives three fractions: Fraction I, b.p. 99–106°, weighs 15–20 g.; Fraction II, b.p. 106–124°, weighs 5–10 g.; and Fraction III, b.p. 125–131°, weighs 60–70 g.. Fraction III is dissolved in 1 l. of hot 10% ethyl alcohol, treated with 0.5 g. of activated carbon, filtered, and the filtrate is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. The 2-cyano-6-methylpyridine separates as white prismatic needles, m.p. 71–73°, and weighs 48–54 g. (40–46% based on 2-picoline-1-oxide) and.
Into a 1-L flask containing 125 mL of methylene chloride and a magnetic stirring bar (4-cm length) is added at room temperature (20°C) 5.35 mL, 6.19 g (0.030 mol) of (S,S)-(−)-diethyl tartrate (DET) by means of a 10-mL syringe. The flask is stoppered with a septum cap and purged with argon. Titanium(IV) isopropoxide, Ti(OiPr)4, (4.48 mL, 0.015 mol) is introduced through the septum via a 10-mL syringe. The stirred limpid solution immediately turns yellow. After a few minutes distilled water (0.27 mL, 0.015 mol) is added dropwise using a calibrated syringe. Strong stirring is maintained until there is total dissolution of water and formation of a pale-yellow solution (after 25 min). Methyl p-tolyl sulfide (4.09 mL, 4.20 g, 0.030 mol) dissolved in 5 mL of methylene chloride is introduced with a 10-mL syringe that is then rinsed with 5 mL of methylene chloride. The flask is cooled (−30°C) with an acetone–dry ice bath while it is stirred for 40 min. At this point 5.54 mL of 80% cumene hydroperoxide (0.030 mol, 5.70 g) is added dropwise from a 10-mL syringe, with stirring, during 5 min. The reaction flask is kept in a freezer (−23°C) overnight (15 hr). Hydrolysis is then effected by adding 5.05 mL of water followed by vigorous stirring for 90 min at room temperature (20°C).
This solution is then cooled and made slightly acid by adding about 275 cc. of 50 per cent acetic acid. Salt is added if necessary to cause the ester to separate. The ester layer is separated, dried over calcium chloride, and fractionally distilled under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask (p. 130).
B. 3,3'-Dimethylbiphenyl. Twenty-seven grams (0.13 mole) of o-tolidine is tetrazotized according to Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 2, 145 (1943). It is not necessary to take the indicated precautions against a slight excess of nitrous acid. The clear orange tetrazonium solution is added to 290 ml. of 30% hypophosphorous acid, and the mixture is allowed to stand, loosely stoppered, at room temperature for 16–18 hours.
A solution of 1.43 g. (0.0080 mole) of sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate in the least possible amount of water is combined with a solution of 0.55 g. (0.0080 mole) of sodium nitrite in the least amount of water. A mixture of 16 ml. of 2N sulfuric acid and 22 ml. of glycerol is placed in a 250-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a low-temperature thermometer, and a stirrer, and the flask is immersed in a bath of acetone and dry ice. The stirred mixture is cooled to −15°, and the solution of sodium 2-aminobenzenesulfinate and sodium nitrite is added dropwise over a period of about 5 minutes; the cooling and rate of addition are such as to maintain the temperature at −15° ± 3°. The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours at this temperature, and 30 ml. of ether is added. The product is stirred vigorously for a few minutes and then allowed to warm to −6° with gentle stirring. The ether layer is decanted or transferred by means of a chilled pipet into a vessel cooled in a dry ice bath, and the reaction mixture is again cooled to −15°. In this way the reaction mixture is extracted with five 20-ml. portions of ether. After the last extraction the aqueous layer is frozen solid and the ether layer is poured off. The combined extracts are dried at −20°, first over calcium chloride and then over phosphorus pentoxide; a cold room at −20° is particularly convenient for this operation. The solution is transferred to a tared distillation flask immersed in an ice bath, and the ether is removed by evaporation under reduced pressure. The flask is weighed rapidly and dried in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide at −20° ( Caution!(Note 12)). The residue is 1,2,3-benzothiadiazole 1,1-dioxide in the form of yellow-brown needles; weight 0.77–1.04 g. (57–77%). It explodes between 45° and 60°.
Column chromatography is performed on the mixed fraction Sample 2.1 and elution with a mixture of EtOAc and petroleum ether (50:50, 550 mL, until complete elution of ligand (S)-1 and sulfone) followed by EtOAc (1.4 L) and evaporation of the EtOAc fraction under reduced pressure gives pure sulfoxide as a yellow-brown solid (0.93 g, 7% yield, Sample 3).
Two hundred grams of sodium nitrite is dissolved in 400 cc. of water in a 2-l. beaker, and 40 g. of copper powder is added. The mixture is stirred with an efficient stirrer, and a suspension of the p-nitrophenyldiazonium fluoborate in 200 cc. of water is added slowly. Much frothing occurs, and 4–5 cc. of ether is added from time to time to break the foam. The reaction is complete when all the diazonium compound has been added. The product is filtered with suction, washed several times with water, twice with dilute sodium hydroxide solution, and again with water. The solid is dried in an oven at 110°, powdered, and extracted with 300-cc., 200-cc., and 150-cc. portions of boiling benzene. The benzene is evaporated on a water bath, and the residue is crystallized from 120–150 cc. of boiling glacial acetic acid. The resulting reddish yellow crystals, melting at 172–173°, weigh 28–34.5 g. (67–82 per cent yield). Recrystallization from alcohol yields pale yellow crystals melting at 173°.
The condenser is again arranged for refluxing, and 1.2 l. of ethyl acetate(Note 7) is added to the warm sodium ethoxide through the separatory funnel as rapidly as possible. The stirrer is started immediately, and 174 g. (220 ml., 3 moles) of acetone is dropped in over a period of 15–20 minutes, refluxing being maintained by heating if necessary. Addition of the acetone must be started as soon as the ethyl acetate has been added. During the addition the solution becomes quite red, and then the mixture turns brown. The mixture is refluxed for 1 hour; the stirrer is then stopped and the contents of the flask are allowed to stand at room temperature for 12 hours, during which time crystals of the sodium salt separate.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and thermometer, 72 g. (0.35 mole) of anthraquinone (p. 554) is dissolved in 1060 g. of concentrated sulfuric acid by stirring at room temperature, and 42 cc. of water is then added to the red solution. The flask is immersed up to the neck in an oil bath, and 48 g. (0.76 gram atom) of precipitated copper is added during one and one-half hours, the reaction mixture being kept at a temperature of 38–42°, if necessary by external heating, until all the copper has dissolved; this requires about three hours.
B. 6-Oxodecanal. The drying tube is removed and the flask is flushed with nitrogen. A nitrogen atmosphere is maintained throughout the subsequent reaction. A dropping funnel is attached and charged with 7.45 g (0.04 mol) of 6-oxodecanoic acid, 3.32 g of pyridine, and 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran, which are mixed well by shaking. The flask is charged with 45 mL of acetonitrile and 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran and cooled (methanol–liquid nitrogen) to −30°C. The contents of the funnel are added to the flask at −30°C over 30 min. The reaction mixture is stirred at −30°C for an additional hour and at −20°C for 30 min. After the mixture is cooled to −90°C, 34 mL (0.046 mol) of a 1.35 M solution of lithium tri(tert-butoxy)aluminum hydride in tetrahydrofuran is injected through the septum by means of a syringe over 30 min, while the internal temperature is kept below −85°C. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 min at −90°C. To the flask is added 50 mL of 2 M hydrochloric acid solution, and the cooling bath is immediately removed. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with two 50-mL portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure to yield 5.78–6.35 g (85–93%) of 6-oxodecanal as a fragrant liquid, bp 85–90°C (1.4 mm).
A. [(R)-2,2'-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl]ruthenium(II) complex. A dry, 80-mL Schlenk tube connected to a supply of argon is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a glass stopper. The flask is charged with [RuCl2(benzene)]2 (130.5 mg, 0.261 mmol), (R)-BINAP (341 mg, 0.548 mmol), and then is evacuated and filled with argon. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (9 mL) is introduced with a hypodermic syringe under a stream of argon and the inlet is sealed by a glass stopper using silicon grease. The suspension is stirred at 100°C for 10 min under argon, giving a clear reddish brown solution. The reaction mixture is cooled and concentrated at 1 mm at 50°C with vigorous stirring and then at 0.1 mm for 1 hr to give 500 mg of (R)-BINAP-Ru(II) complex as a reddish brown solid, which is used as the hydrogenation catalyst.
D. Dimethyl 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate. Dimethyl dihydro-1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate (20 g, 0.1 mol) is slurried in 800 mL of methylene chloride in a 2-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and the mixture is cooled with an ice/water bath. A stream of nitrous gases is bubbled into the reaction mixture with stirring for 15 min. The color of the reaction mixture changes from orange to bright red during the addition. Stirring is continued for 1.5 hr as the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The solvent and excess nitrous gases are removed under reduced pressure to afford dimethyl 1,2,4,5-tetrazine-3,6-dicarboxylate (19.7 g, 99%) as a bright red, crystalline solid: mp 173–175°C.
A. [(E)-3,3-dimethoxy-2-methyl-1-propenyl]benzene (1). An oven-dried 25-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar is charged with (E)-2-methyl-3-phenylpropenal (6.0 mL, 43 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and Amberlyst 15 (50 mg). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum, flushed with nitrogen, cooled in an ice-water bath, and charged with trimethyl orthoformate (5.8 mL, 53 mmol, 1.2 equiv) and dry methanol (1.0 mL, 25 mmol, 0.56 equiv). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 36 h. The resin is removed by filtration through a cotton plug, and the volatiles are removed using a rotary evaporator. The resultant oil is purified by short path vacuum distillation. The main fraction is collected at 120-130 °C (2.7 mmHg) and provides 6.48 g (78% yield) of the desired [(E)-3,3-dimethoxy-2-methyl-1-propenyl]benzene (1).
C. Cyclobutene. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 100-mL dropping funnel equipped with an argon-inlet tube, a magnetic stirring bar, and a water-cooled condenser. The outlet of the condenser is attached to an all-glass transfer manifold. Two weighed traps fitted with gastight stopcocks and immersed in dry ice–acetone baths are attached to the manifold. A calcium chloride drying tube is attached to the exit of the second trap. While the system is continuously purged with a slow stream of argon, the flask is charged with 33.6 g (0.30 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide and 120 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide, and a solution of 25.6 g (0.113 mol) of cyclobutyl tosylate in 30 mL of anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide is placed in the dropping funnel. The potassium tert-butoxide suspension is stirred vigorously and heated to 70°C. The cyclobutyl tosylate solution is then added dropwise over a 10-min period. After the addition is completed, the reaction mixture is stirred at 70°C for an additional 2 hr. The manifold system is closed off from the reaction vessel and the material collected in the first trap is slowly warmed. The product distills at ca. 2°C into the second dry-ice-cooled trap to give 4.3–5.1 g (70–84%) of cyclobutene [lit.2 bp 2°C],(Note 11),(Note 12).
A. 5-Benzylaminotetrazole. Freshly distilled benzaldehyde (21.2 g, 0.2 mol) is added in one portion to a warm (50°C) solution of 5-aminotetrazole (17.2 g, 0.2 mol) and triethylamine (20.2 g, 0.2 mol) in 100 mL of absolute methanol. After 15 min the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, transferred to an autoclave, and hydrogenated with agitation at room temperature over Pd (10%) on carbon (1 g) for 18 hr at 500 psi (pounds per square inch) of hydrogen. The catalyst is removed by filtration and all volatile material is removed at 60°C under aspirator pressure. The gummy tan solid is triturated with 250 mL of hot water. Aqueous 20% HCl is added until pH 3 is reached. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and the solid collected, washed with water, and dried over-night at room temperature under reduced pressure (100 μ); yield: 27.5 g (80%), mp 183.5–185°C (lit.2 mp 183°C).
D. (R)-(+)-2-Diphenylphosphinyl-2'-methoxy-1,1'-binaphthyl (5). A 250-mL round-bottomed flask is charged with crude 4, 5.55 g (40.2 mmol) of potassium carbonate(K2CO3), and 66 mL of acetone . To this mixture is added 2.5 mL (40.2 mmol) of methyl iodide (MeI). The reaction mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. After the reaction is cooled to room temperature it is filtered through a Celite pad, and the filter cake is washed with diethyl ether (Et2O). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to give 6.88 g of 5 as a brown powder. This crude material is carried on to the next step without purification, assuming 100% yield.
B. N,N'-Bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-N"-benzylguanidine. An oven-dried, 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with N,N'-di-Boc-N"-triflylguanidine (1.00 g, 2.55 mmol) and dichloromethane (13 mL, Notes 11, 12). Benzylamine (0.31 mL, 2.8 mmol, Note 13) is added in one portion via syringe at room temperature. After 30 min, the mixture is transferred to a 60-mL separatory funnel and washed with 2 M aqueous sodium bisulfate (10 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate (10 mL). Each aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 10 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (10 mL), dried (MgSO4), filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford N,N'-di-Boc-N"-benzylguanidine in quantitative yield (0.89 g, Notes 14, 15).
The residue is added to a solution of 50 g. of sodium in about a liter of 95 per cent alcohol. The solution is boiled under a reflux condenser for about one hour and then allowed to stand overnight. The reaction mixture is diluted with about 6 l. of water and the two layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three or four 500-cc. portions of carbon tetrachloride, and the extracts are added to the bromomesitylene. This solution is then washed thoroughly with water. The carbon tetrachloride solution is separated, dried over calcium chloride, and distilled. After the carbon tetrachloride is removed the bromomesitylene is fractionated carefully under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask. The fraction boiling at 105–107°/16–17 mm. is bromomesitylene. The yield is 840–870 g. (79–82 per cent of the theoretical amount). There is a small low-boiling portion (about 25 g.) and also a small high-boiling residue. The bromomesitylene obtained in this way gives no precipitate on standing twenty-four hours with alcoholic silver nitrate solution. It has a melting point of −1° to +1°.
B. 2-(Hydroxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane. A 500-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 21.10 g (0.0975 mol) of 2-(trimethylsiloxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane in 170 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 44 mL of ca. 1 N aqueous sulfuric acid. The resultant two-phase mixture is then stirred vigorously for 1.5 hr at room temperature. Solid anhydrous potassium carbonate is added carefully until bubbling subsides. The layers are separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with 100 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and distilled at atmospheric pressure to remove the solvents. The remaining liquid is distilled at reduced pressure to give a forerun, 0.4 g, bp 22–54°C (4 mm), and 10.95 g (78%) of 2-(hydroxymethyl)allyltrimethylsilane as a colorless liquid, bp 54–56°C (2 mm).
In order to remove the ethanol, the crystals are dissolved in toluene (3 mL per g of clathrate) at 70°C, and the solution is evaporated to dryness on a rotary evaporator at 45°C/100 mm. This procedure is repeated once more. A portion of the solid so obtained (68.5 g) is mixed with toluene (800 mL) at 80°C in a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead, mechanical stirrer, until the TADDOL [(R,R)-2,2-dimethyl-α,α,α',α'-tetra(naphth-2-yl)-1,3-dioxolane-4',5'-dimethanol] is completely dissolved. Hexane (800 mL) is added slowly with the solution being maintained between 65–70°C. On cooling, a white precipiate starts to form at approximately 58°C. The mixture is allowed to cool completely to room temperature, and the resulting thick slurry is stirred overnight. Further solvent ( 500 mL of a 1 : 1 mixture of toluene-hexane ) is added to the now unstirrable suspension. The mixture is shaken vigorously to give a stirrable slurry. The solid is removed by vacuum filtration and washed first with the mother liquor, then with a 1 : 1 toluene/hexane mixture (300 mL), and finally with hexane (300 mL). The resulting solid is dried under high vacuum (0.3 mbar) at 90°C for 10 hr in a vacuum oven to give the title TADDOL ligand as a white solid (42.0 g, 61%). The mother liquor is concentrated under vacuum to give a yellow solid (24.5 g) that is again purified as described above by recrystallization from 300 mL of toluene and 300 mL of hexane to give a second crop of the TADDOL ligand (14.5 g, 21%), for a combined yield of 56.5 g (82%), mp 204–208°C (sintering at 155°C), [α]RT D −115.4° (ethyl acetate, c 1),.
The distillate is saturated with salt, and the cyclohexene is separated from the water layer. It is dried with calcium chloride and fractionated through an efficient column. The fraction boiling at 80–82° (uncorr.) is collected separately. It may be necessary to refractionate the low- and high-boiling portions once or twice. The high-boiling fraction is finally added to the next run. The yield of cyclohexene is 260–285 g. (79–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The solution is distilled under reduced pressure on an oil bath, the temperature of which is raised to 110° near the end of the distillation. The solid residue left in the flask after removal of the solvent is taken out and washed until nearly white with 95 per cent alcohol which has been cooled in an ice bath. This requires about four washings of 50 cc. of alcohol each. The yield is 65–75 g. (32–37 per cent of the theoretical amount). The melting point is 121–123°.
The toluene layer is transferred to a 1-l. flask, without drying, and the unchanged toluene distilled off; the ditolylethane is then collected over a range of 295–310°. There is practically no intermediate fraction, but a tarry residue of about 75 g. remains in the flask. Upon redistillation, the ditolylethane is collected at 295–300°. The yield is 290–310 g. (60–64 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
To a cold mixture of 800 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 200 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer, is added 250 g. (1.33 moles) of crude 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene (p. 111). The solution is stirred and cooled to 10°, and a solution of 148 g. (2.05 moles) of u.s.p. sodium nitrite in 260 cc. of water is added from a separatory funnel. During this addition, the temperature of the mixture must not be allowed to rise above 10°. After all of the nitrite solution has been added, the mixture is stirred twenty minutes longer to complete the diazotization.
B. Cyclohexanol. A 25-ml., oven-dried, round-bottomed flask is charged with 1.722 g. (0.01524 mole) of cyclohexyl methyl ether. The flask is purged with nitrogen and sealed with a rubber septum. With oven-dried syringes, 4 ml. of chloroform, 0.5 g. (0.5 ml., 0.006 mole) of pyridine and, and 4.8 g. (3.5 ml., 0.024 mole) of freshly prepared iodotrimethylsilane are injected into the flask in the order specified. When the iodotrimethylsilane is added, the solution becomes slightly yellow and a precipitate appears. The mixture is heated without stirring at 60° for 64 hours, after which the reaction is normally complete. Anhydrous methanol (2 ml.) is added, the mixture is cooled to room temperature, and the volatile components are removed on a rotary evaporator. Approximately 10 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added, and the resulting suspension is filtered, removing pyridinium hydroiodide. The flask and the filter cake are washed thoroughly with ca. 50 ml. of anhydrous ether. The ether is evaporated, and the residual oil is purified by chromatography on 70 g. of silica gel packed with anhydrous ether in a 3 × 50 cm. glass column. The column is eluted with anhydrous ether, and 5–7 ml. fractions are collected and analyzed by TLC. Fractions containing product are combined and evaporated, affording 1.26–1.35 g. (83–89%) of cyclohexanol.
The cold, clear red filtrate is now poured rapidly into a 2-l. flask containing 325 ml. of ice-cold 30% hypophosphorous acid solution. Immediate evolution of nitrogen occurs. The flask is stoppered loosely, placed in a refrigerator for 8–10 hours, and then allowed to stand at room temperature for another 8–10 hours. The reaction product is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the lower dark brown layer is separated from the aqueous phase. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 125-ml. portions of ether. The brown oil combined with the ether extracts is washed in a separatory funnel with two 30-ml. portions of 20% sodium hydroxide solution. Separation into two layers occurs rapidly, but occasionally the aqueous phase will remain turbid for some time. The loss by discarding the turbid sodium hydroxide washings is negligible. The ether solution is dried with a minimal amount of anhydrous potassium carbonate, 5 g. usually being sufficient.
The apparatus consists of a 200-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with thermometer, reflux condenser, and gas-inlet tube. The flask is charged with 17.8 g. (0.10 mole) of 3-benzoylpropionic acid, 10.6 g. (10.6 ml., 0.10 mole) of benzaldehyde, 61.3 g. (57 ml., 0.60 mole) of acetic anhydride, and 8.2 g. (0.10 mole) of powdered anhydrous sodium acetate (freshly fused). The flask is placed in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 95–100° and is kept there for 2 hours while dry oxygen-free nitrogen is passed through the reaction mixture. At the end of this time the flask is removed from the oil bath, and the hot solution is decanted from the sodium acetate into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The solution is kept at 0–5° in a refrigerator for 1 hour, during which time α-benzylidene-γ-phenyl-Δβ,γ-butenolide separates as an orange solid.
A. Glyoxylic acid p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone. A solution of 46.3 g. (0.50 mole) of 80% glyoxylic acid in 500 ml. of water is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and warmed on a steam bath to approximately 60°. This solution is then treated with a warm (approximately 60°) solution of 93.1 g. (0.50 mole) of p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide in 250 ml. (0.63 mole) of aqueous 2.5M hydrochloric acid. The resulting mixture is heated on a steam bath with continuous stirring until all the hydrazone, which initially separates as an oil, has solidified (about 5 minutes is required). After the reaction mixture has been allowed cool to room temperature and then allowed to stand in a refrigerator overnight, the crude p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone is collected on a filter, washed with cold water, and allowed to dry for 2 days. The crude product (110–116 g., m.p. 145–149° dec.) is dissolved in 400 ml. of boiling ethyl acetate, filtered to remove any insoluble material, and then diluted with 800 ml. of carbon tetrachloride and allowed to cool. After the mixture has been allowed to stand overnight in a refrigerator, the p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone is collected and washed with cold mixture of ethyl acetate and carbon tetrachloride (1:2 by volume). The yield is 92.4–98.5 g. (76–81%) of the hydrazone as white crystals, m.p. 148–154° dec..
A solution of 77.2 g. (0.5 mole) of 4-t-butylcyclohexanone in 500 ml. of dry ether is then placed in the dropping funnel and slowly added to the "mixed hydride" solution without much cooling so that gentle refluxing is maintained After addition of the ketone over a period of 45–60 minutes the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours more to complete the reduction. The excess hydride is destroyed by the addition of 10 ml. of dry t-butanol, and the mixture is refluxed for an additional 30 minutes. 4-t-Butylcyclohexanone (3 g.) in 20 ml. of dry ether is then added to the reaction mixture, which is refluxed for 4 hours more and allowed to stand overnight,. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and decomposed by successive additions of 100 ml. of water and 250 ml. of 10% aqueous sulfuric acid. The ethereal layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 150 ml. of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed once with water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The extract is filtered from magnesium sulfate and the ether removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residue, weighing 85–87 g., solidifies in the flask and on gas chromatographic analysis (see) is found to contain 96% trans alcohol, 0.8% cis alcohol, and 3.2% ketone.
B. (S)-(−)-1-Formyl-2-hydroxymethylpyrrolidine. The 2-L flask containing the crude hydroxymethyl derivative (ca. 1 mol) is equipped with a dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar and cooled to 0°C. Eighty milliliters (1.3 mol) of methyl formate is added over a period of 20 min and stirring is continued for 30 min at 0°C to give a green-colored solution. Excess methyl formate is evaporated at 30°C, affording a dark oil, which is taken up in 600 mL of dichloromethane and dried twice by stirring over a sufficient amount of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by suction filtration through Celite, using a large column, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure at 30°C. Any remaining traces of solvents are removed by stirring under reduced pressure using and oil pump (20°C at 1 mm). This procedure takes about 2 hr and yields ca. 130 g (ca. 1 mol) of the dry, crude N-formyl compound, which is used in the next step without further purification.
The residue is dissolved in 200 cc. of water, transferred to a 1-l. flask, and cooled to 0° in an ice-salt bath. A mixture of 400 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 200 g. of cracked ice is added slowly until the mixture is acid to Congo red. The temperature of the mixture must not rise above 10°. Potassium chloride separates. The mixture is extracted with two 200-cc. portions and four 100-cc. portions of alcohol-free ether to remove the isopropylmalonic acid. The ether solution is placed in a flask fitted with a reflux condenser, and 160 g. (1 mole) of bromine is added gradually over a period of about two hours at such a rate that the ether boils gently. When the bromination is complete, the ether solution is washed with 100 cc. of water to remove the hydrobromic acid, dried over 25 g. of calcium chloride, and freed from ether by distillation on the steam bath. The crude isopropylbromomalonic acid is heated in the distilling flask in an oil bath at 125–130° until no more carbon dioxide is evolved. It is then distilled under reduced pressure; the fraction distilling at 140–160°/40 mm. is collected separately and redistilled. The yield of product boiling at 148–153°/40 mm. (125–130°/15 mm.) is 100–120 g. (55–66 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 1-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer and immersed in an ice bath, is placed 46 g. (0.7 mole) of sodium azide in 150 ml. of water. A mixture of 109 g. (0.5 mole) of lauroyl chloride (b.p. 134–137°/11 mm.) and 150 ml. of acetone is then added from a separatory funnel to the well-stirred solution of the azide at such a rate that the temperature remains at 10–15°. After the mixture has been stirred at this temperature for an hour, the stirrer is stopped and, when the layers have separated, the lower water layer is removed carefully by suction through a glass capillary tube. The upper layer is then added slowly to 500 ml. of benzene which has been warmed to 60°. A rather rapid evolution of gas results, and the mixture is kept at 60–70° until no more nitrogen is evolved; the conversion of azide to isocyanate requires about an hour. The solution is filtered to remove any insoluble matter, and the benzene is removed by distillation from a modified Claisen flask. Distillation of the residue yields 80–85 g. of ester (81–86%) and.
A. N-Hexyl-2-methyl-4-methoxyaniline . A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a rubber septum is flame-dried and allowed to cool to room temperature under an argon purge. The septum is removed and the flask is charged with tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (114 mg, 0.125 mmol, 0.5 mol% Pd), (±)-BINAP (233 mg, 0.375 mmol, 0.75 mol%), and sodium tert-butoxide (NaOtBu) (6.73 g, 70.0 mmol, 1.4 equiv). The septum is again placed on the flask, and the flask is purged with argon for 5 min. Toluene (50 mL) is added and stirring is started. The flask is charged with 4-bromo-3-methylanisole (10.0 g, 50.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv), n-hexylamine (7.9 mL, 60.0 mmol, 1.2 equiv), and additional toluene (50 mL). The resulting dark red mixture is placed in an oil bath that is heated to 80°C with stirring until the aryl bromide has been completely consumed as judged by GC analysis (18-23 hr). The mixture is removed from the oil bath, allowed to cool to room temperature, then poured into a separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with ether (2 × 50 mL), brine (100 mL), deionized water (20 mL), and again with ether (50 mL). All rinses are added to the separatory funnel, the funnel is shaken, and the layers are separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with ether (50 mL), and the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The mixture is filtered; the magnesium sulfate is washed with ether (50 mL), filtered, and the organic solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to give the crude product as a brown oil. This oil is then distilled (bulb-to-bulb, bp 92°C at 0.001 mm) to afford 10.35 g (94%) of the desired product as a pale yellow oil. A small amount of viscous material remains in the distillation flask following the distillation.
The distillate is washed four times with 200-ml. portions of water, and the organic layer is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The yield of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is 56 g. (70%). The diene can be separated from higher-boiling contaminants by a simple distillation at atmospheric pressure under nitrogen; b.p. 78–80°, yield 28–32 g. (35–40%).
B. (S)-N,N-Dimethyl-N'-(1-tert-butoxy-3-methyl-2-butyl)formamidine (2). In a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask 26 g (140 mmol) of the formamide from Part A is dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol and 200 mL of a 50% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution is added. The mixture is heated at reflux overnight; on cooling, the reaction separates into colorless aqueous and organic layers. The two layers are extracted 3 times with 100 mL of ether and the combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of brine. After the solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, the ether and ethanol are carefully removed under aspirator vacuum at ambient temperature. The crude amine is treated with 25 g (210 mmol) of N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal and the reaction mixture is heated under argon at 40°C for 1 hr. The solution is concentrated under reduced pressure and the crude product is distilled bulb-to-bulb (0.05 mm, 55–65°C) to give 25.7–27 g (86–91.5%) of (S)-N,N-dimethyl-N'-(1-tert-butoxy-3-methyl-2-butyl)formamidine (2) as a colorless liquid.
The filtrate is extracted twice, 150 cc. of benzene being used for each extraction. The precipitate of quinone is transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and 500 cc. of benzene, including the 300 cc. used to extract the filtrate, is added. The mixture is now heated with stirring on a steam bath, and as soon as most of the quinone has dissolved the benzene layer is decanted into another beaker. It is dried while hot by stirring a short time with a little calcium chloride, and then filtered through an ordinary funnel into a 1-l. distilling flask before it cools. There is a certain amount of quinone which does not go into the 500 cc. of benzene, so that the residue is extracted a second time with about 100 cc. of benzene, which is dried and filtered with the first extract. During these extractions, the benzene should not be at the boiling point, as this will cause a considerable volatilization of the quinone.
The purified material melts at 197–198° and weighs 105–115 g. (52–58%).
The resulting clear yellow-orange solution is transferred to a 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask and concentrated at ca. 20 mm with a rotary evaporator. Anhydrous diethyl ether (230 mL) is added to precipitate triphenylphosphine oxide hydrobromide ; the solid is separated by suction filtration and washed with two 100-mL portions of anhydrous ether. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure and the resulting orange liquid is taken up in 350 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether . This solution is filtered to separate any remaining salt and transferred to a 500-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet adapter, a rubber septum, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel.
A. Phenyl benzeneselenosulfonate. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a 250-mL addition funnel containing 17.2 g (100 mmol) of benzenesulfonyl hydrazide and 125 mL of dichloromethane is charged with 18.9 g (100 mmol) of phenylseleninic acid and 125 mL of dichloromethane. The seleninic acid is stirred at 25°C as the hydrazide slurry is added over 1 hr. After an additional hour at 25°C, the reaction mixture is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 250 mL of hot methanol and the solution of selenosulfonate is cooled overnight at ca. 5°C in a refrigerator to induce crystallization. The yellow product that precipitates is filtered and recrystallized from methanol to afford 24.3–25.2 g (83–85%) of phenyl benzeneselenosulfonate, mp 56°C.
B. (−)-α-Pinene. Concurrently, a 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask (fitted with a septum-capped adapter, gastight mechanical stirrer, and a tube adapter connected to a gas bubbler) is purged with inert gas and. The flask is then charged with 1588 mL of (−)-β-pinene. To the vigorously stirred pinene at 25°C is added the KAPA (0.1 mol) prepared in part A, using a double-ended needle, over 15 min. The reaction mixture is stirred for 24 hr at 25°C and is then quenched by addition of 100 mL of ice-cold water. The reaction mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel, washed with two 100-mL portions of water, and dried with anhydrous calcium chloride. The crude pinene is decanted from the calcium chloride through a plug of glass wool and distilled at reduced pressure from lithium aluminium hydride and. The yield of (−)-α-pinene, bp 72–73°C (46 mm), [α]D23 −47.45° (neat, 92% ee), is 1264 g (93%). The chemical and isomeric purity is 99% by GLC and.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with an efficient reflux condenser of wide bore, are placed, in the following order, 80 g. of powdered crystalline ferrous sulfate, 865 g. (687 cc., 9.4 moles) of c.p. glycerol, 218 g. (213 cc., 2.3 moles) of aniline, 170 g. (141 cc., 1.4 moles) of nitrobenzene, and 400 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The contents of the flask are well mixed and the mixture heated gently over a free flame. As soon as the liquid begins to boil, the flame is removed, since the heat evolved by the reaction is sufficient to keep the mixture boiling for one-half to one hour. If the reaction proceeds too violently at the beginning, the reflux condenser may be assisted by placing a wet towel over the upper part of the flask. When the boiling has ceased the heat is again applied and the mixture boiled for five hours. It is then allowed to cool to about 100° and transferred to a 12-l. flask; the 5-l. flask is rinsed out with a small quantity of water.
A. (S)-Phenylalanol. A dry, 3-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser connected to a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is loaded with 165 g (1.00 mol) of (S)-phenylalanine, then equipped with a 250-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel capped with a rubber septum through which is inserted a nitrogen inlet needle. The flask is swept with nitrogen and filled with 500 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, and the addition funnel is charged with 123 mL (1.00 mol) of freshly distilled boron trifluoride etherate via cannula. The boron trifluoride etherate is added dropwise to the phenylalanine slurry over a 30-min period with stirring, and the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr, resulting in a colorless, homogeneous solution. The addition funnel is then charged via cannula with 88 g (110 mL, 1.15 mol) of 20 M borane–dimethyl sulfide complex, which is added carefully to the vigorously refluxing solution over a 100-min period. During the course of the addition there is continuous evolution of dimethyl sulfide and hydrogen gas, and the solution turns from orange to light brown. A vigorous exotherm occurs approximately half way through the addition period. (Caution! See) The solution is heated at reflux for an additional 6 hr after the addition is complete and, then allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The excess borane is quenched by the slow addition of 125 mL of a 1:1 tetrahydrofuran–water solution followed by 750 mL of 5 M aqueous sodium hydroxide. The resulting two-phase mixture is heated at reflux for 12 hr, cooled to room temperature, and filtered through a coarse fritted funnel. The residual solids are washed with two 25-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to remove the bulk of the tetrahydrofuran. The resulting slurry is extracted with one 400-mL and three 200-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation, yielding 141–158 g (93–104%) of a white crystalline solid that is recrystallized from ca. 600 mL of ethyl acetate to give 111–113 g (73–75%) of the desired product as white needles in two crops, mp 88.5–91°C.
On cooling, the filtrate yields about 175 g. of p-iodobenzoic acid. Concentration of the mother liquor yields crystals which are contaminated with mercuric iodide. The latter may be removed by grinding the crystals in a mortar with water and enough sodium iodide or potassium iodide to destroy the red color of the mercuric iodide. The mixture is filtered and the crystals are washed with a little sodium iodide solution and then with water. The washed p-iodobenzoic acid melts at 266–267°. The total yield is 150–170 g. (72–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Sodium arsenite is prepared by dissolving 226 g. (1.1 moles) of powdered arsenious oxide, made into a paste with a little water, in a solution of 275 g. (6.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 600 cc. of water. This solution, diluted with 600 cc. of water, is poured into a 2-l. three-necked flask provided with a reflux condenser and a mechanical stirrer, and 150 g. (125 cc., 1.2 moles) of freshly distilled nitrobenzene is added.
The 1-L flask containing the crude L-alanine-N-methylamide 1 is equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar. The solids are scraped off the walls using a spatula. The flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and charged with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g) and dichloromethane (140 mL). The mixture is stirred at ambient temperature and treated sequentially with triethylamine (60.0 mL, 43.6 g, 0.425 mol, 1.5 equiv) and pivaldehyde (95% purity, 35 mL, 28 g, 0.31 mmol, 1.07 equiv corrected for purity). The flask is fitted with a rubber septum through which is inserted both an 18-gauge needle connected to a nitrogen inlet with a gas bubbler and a thermocouple probe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 4 h at ambient temperature. Additional pivaldehyde (3 mL) and magnesium sulfate (5 g) are added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min at ambient temperature. The septum is removed and replaced with a 250-mL addition funnel. Toluene (200 mL) is added over 10 min, and the mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The mixture is then filtered through a 350-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel to remove the triethylamine hydrochloride and magnesium sulfate. The filter cake is washed with toluene (3 × 50 mL). The combined filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (100 mmHg initially to 20 mmHg, 45 °C bath temperature) to 70 g. Additional triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates during this concentration, so additional toluene (100 mL) is added and the mixture is filtered through a 60-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (20 mmHg, 50 °C bath temperature), then vacuum dried (0.1 mmHg, 23 °C) for 4 h to afford (S,E)-2-(2,2-dimethylpropylidenamino)-N-methylpropanamide (2) (44.2-46.5 g, 95% purity, 86-90% yield) as a pale yellow oil.
N-o-Tolylformamide (135 g., 1.00 mole) is added to the hot stirred suspension, which becomes a clear solution within a few minutes. The solution is cooled to 10–20° by means of an ice bath and maintained at this temperature while 92 g. (0.60 mole) of phosphorus oxychloride is added to it with stirring over the course of 30–40 minutes. The reaction mixture is stirred at 30–35° for 1 hour and poured into an ice-cold stirred solution of 50 g. of sodium bicarbonate in 5 l. of water. o-Tolyl isocyanide precipitates as an oil. It is taken up in 300 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°), and the organic phase is separated in a separatory funnel. The aqueous phase is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of petroleum ether. The combined extracts are washed with 50 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over 50 g. of powdered potassium hydroxide, and distilled through a 30-cm. vacuum-jacketed Vigreux column. o-Tolyl isocyanide is collected as a colorless, vile-smelling liquid at 61–63°/10 mm.; nD25 1.5212–1.5222; weight 74–85 g. (63–73%).
The filtrate-containing flask is equipped with a 12"-Vigreux column, distillation head, receiver, and heating mantle, and dichloromethane is removed by distillation (head temperature to 40°C). The residual oil is cooled and transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask and the flask is equipped with a simple distillation head, cow receiver, and heating mantle. After a brief forerun (2–3 g), product is collected by distillation at 30 mm (65–120°C) into a chilled receiver (5°C) to afford 54–68 g (75–85%) of crude 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde. The crude product is transferred to a 100-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 6"-Vigreux column, cow receiver, and heating mantle, and redistilled at 30 mm, collecting the fraction distilling at 67–73°C into a chilled receiver to afford 50–64 g of product (70–80%, 34–45% overall,).
B. 5-Methyl-2-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)oxypyridine (2). The following procedure for the preparation of the 5-methyl-2-pyridyl triflate may also be used to synthesize the 4- and 6-methyl derivatives. A 200-mL Schlenk flask containing a Teflon-coated, magnetic stirring bar and capped with a rubber septum is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (1) (4.85 g, 44.4 mmol) and dry pyridine (140 mL). After the reactant dissolves, the flask is cooled to −12°C by immersion in an acetone/ice bath. Trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride (15.1 g, 53.5 mmol) is added rapidly to the flask via syringe through the rubber septum. The solution is stirred at 0°C for 30 min and poured into a separatory funnel containing H2O (150 mL). The mixture is extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) (3 × 100 mL) and the combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. Filtration and concentration on a rotary evaporator, followed by flash chromatography on 375 g of deactivated silica gel with 20% EtOAc:80% hexanes, gives 9.89 g (92%) of 5-methyl-2-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)oxypyridine as a clear, colorless oil.
B. Mixed benzoic-carbonic anhydride. In a 500-ml. three-necked flask, equipped with a low-temperature thermometer, an efficient sealed stirrer, and an adaptive joint carrying a drying tube and a dropping funnel, is placed a solution of 24.4 g. (0.2 mole) of benzoic acid and 20.2 g. (0.2 mole) of triethylamine in 200 ml. of dry toluene. The solution is cooled below 0° by means of an ice-salt mixture, and 21.7 g. (0.2 mole) of ethyl chlorocarbonate is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 0° (approximate time for addition is 25–30 minutes). Triethylamine hydrochloride precipitates both during the addition and while the mixture is stirred for 15–25 minutes thereafter.
The product is dissolved in 200 ml. of ether, and the solution is washed with 75 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium carbonate, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and distilled to give 47–56 g. (60–71%) of product, b.p. 66–68° (0.07 mm.), 84–86° (0.8 mm.); m.p. 29°.
A. (S)-3-(1-Oxopropyl)-4-(phenylmethyl)-2-oxazolidinone. A dry, 500-mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 17.7 g (0.100 mol) of (S)-4-(phenylmethyl)-2-oxazolidinone,2 capped with a rubber septum, and flushed with nitrogen. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, 300 mL, is then added to the flask via cannula, and the resulting solution is cooled to −78°C in an acetone–dry ice bath. A solution of 68.3 mL (0.101 mol) of 1.47 M butyllithium in hexane is transferred via cannula first to a dry, septum-stoppered, 100-mL graduated cylinder with a ground-glass joint, and then to the reaction flask over a 10-min period. The solution may turn yellow and slightly cloudy. Freshly distilled propionyl chloride (9.6 mL, 0.11 mol, is added in one portion by syringe after completion of the addition of butyllithium. The resulting clear, nearly colorless solution is stirred for 30 min at −78°C, then allowed to warm to ambient temperature over a 30-min period. Excess propionyl chloride is quenched by the addition of 60 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The bulk of the tetrahydrofuran and hexane is removed on a rotary evaporator (bath temp. ca. 25–30°C), and the resulting slurry is extracted with two 80-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed with 75 mL of an aqueous 1 M sodium hydroxide solution and 75 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the residue, a light-yellow oil, is placed in a refrigerator overnight to crystallize. The resulting crystalline solid is pulverized and triturated with a minimum quantity of cold hexane. After filtration and drying 21.2–22.3 g (91–96%) of the desired product is obtained as a colorless crystalline solid, mp 44–46°C and.
A stainless-steel (AISI 316) autoclave (internal volume 500 mL) equipped with a purging valve, a pressure gauge, a thermocouple, and a magnetic stir bar, is charged with a mixture of phenylacetonitrile (12.0 g, 0.10 mol), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) (147.8 g, 1.64 mol), and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) (28.4 g, 0.21 mol), and is heated in an electrical oven at 180°C. The reaction mixture is magnetically stirred (900 rpm) for 18 hr in the autoclave at 180°C.
The combined filtrates containing benzonitrile oxide are transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, treated immediately with 13.9 g. (0.1 mole) of N-sulfinylaniline added in one portion, with swirling, and set aside protected from moisture, while the temperature reaches a maximum of 33–34° (usually 15 minutes). The mixture is then heated to reflux, protected from moisture, in a temperature-controlled oil bath for 3–5 hours. Continuous evolution of sulfur dioxide takes place during this period at the end of which the mixture is cooled and evaporated under reduced pressure at 70–80° to remove the solvent. The residual dark brown liquid is transferred to a 50-ml., pear-shaped distilling flask and heated, protected from moisture, at 110° for 30 minutes to complete the decomposition. It is then cooled and distilled under high vacuum. Unchanged N-sulfinylaniline (2.0–2.5 g.) distills over at 45–50° (0.1–0.2 mm.). A second fraction (1.2–1.5 g.) is collected until the temperature reaches 112°; then diphenyl carbodiimide is collected at 114–117° (0.1–0.2 mm.) as a clear yellow liquid; yield 10.5–10.8 g. (54–56%); n23D 1.6355; νmax.CHCl3 2140 cm.−1 (very strong), 2110 cm.−1 (medium), and 1480 cm.−1 (medium).
One hundred seventy-seven grams (1 mole) of acetoacetanilide is added in small portions by means of a spatula to 185 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid which has been heated previously to 75° in a 1-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer which extends into the liquid. The temperature of the mixture is maintained at 70–75° by intermittent cooling until nearly all the acetoacetanilide has been added. The last 10–15 g. is added without cooling, and the temperature rises to 95°; the addition requires 20–30 minutes. The heat of reaction maintains the temperature at 95° for about 15 minutes; the reaction mixture is then kept an additional 15 minutes at 95° by external heating. After the solution has cooled to 65°, it is poured into 5 l. of water with vigorous stirring.
A. Diphenylacetyl chloride. A 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser carrying a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 50.0 g. (0.236 mole) of diphenylacetic acid and 150 ml. of thiophene-free, anhydrous benzene. The mixture is heated under reflux, and 132 g. (80.1 ml., 1.11 mole) of thionyl chloride is added dropwise over 30 minutes. Refluxing is continued for 7 additional hours before the benzene and excess thionyl chloride are removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The pale yellow oil which remains contains a little thionyl chloride, best removed by adding 100 ml. of anhydrous benzene and again distilling under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 150 ml. of refluxing, anhydrous hexane. The hot solution is treated with charcoal and filtered, and the filtrate is chilled to 0° in a sealed flask. The product, which crystallizes as colorless plates, is filtered, washed with a little cold hexane, dried at 25° under vacuum for 2 hours, and stored in a tightly stoppered bottle, giving 42–45 g. (77–84%) of product, m.p. 51–53°. Concentration of the hexane mother liquors to about 50 ml. followed by chilling to 0° and addition of a seed crystal gives an additional 2.5–4.0 g. (5–8%) of product of equal purity, for a total yield of 44.5–49 g. (82–94%) of diphenylacetyl chloride, m.p. 51–53°.
The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and is then, for removal of residual lithium, filtered through a fritted glass funnel (5.0 cm diameter, porosity 0). The funnel is subsequently rinsed with THF (100 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at a bath temperature of 40 °C (255-225 mmHg) and then at 50 °C (7.5 mmHg) for 1 h in order to remove THF. Dichloromethane (700 mL) is added to the residue. After stirring for 2 min, insoluble material is removed by filtration with a fritted glass funnel (8.0 cm diameter, porosity 4) filled with silica gel (100 g). The residue is washed with dichloromethane (700 mL) and the filtrate dried over Na2SO4 (50 g). The latter is removed by filtration and the filtrate concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (675-525 mmHg and then 15 mmHg) for 1 h. The crude product remains as a pale yellow semifluidic mass (40.5 g), which solidifies under vacuum overnight (25 °C, 0.3 mmHg). Finally, the product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (air bath temperature 130-175 °C, 0.25 mmHg) to yield pure 1 (19.6 g, 49%) as colorless plates.
The resulting mixture of crude o-chlorophenylthiourea and ammonium chloride (58–62 g.) is powdered finely and suspended in 300 ml. of water. The mixture is warmed slowly to 70° with mechanical stirring, then allowed to cool to 35°, and the solid is filtered with suction. The yield of crude o-chlorophenylthiourea, melting at 140–144°, is 30–35 g. (54–63%).
In a 1-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a dropping funnel are placed 46.2 g. (0.3 mole) of 2,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (β-resorcylic acid, p. 557) and 350 cc. of glacial acetic acid. After the stirrer is started the mixture is warmed until solution results (45°) and then is allowed to cool to 35°. Through the dropping funnel is added a solution of 48 g. (15 cc., 0.3 mole) of bromine in 240 cc. of glacial acetic acid with vigorous stirring over a period of about one hour. The temperature of the reaction mixture remains at 30–35°. When all the bromine is added the solution is poured into 5 l. of water, and the mixture is cooled to 0–5° and allowed to stand for several hours. The fine, white crystals of 2,4-dihydroxy-5-bromobenzoic acid are collected on a 10-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with about 500 cc. of cold water. The crude product, after air drying at room temperature, melts at 194–200° and weighs 55–60 g. For purification it is dissolved in 1.5 l. of boiling water, and the solution is refluxed for one hour, filtered while hot, and cooled in an ice bath. The material which crystallizes is collected, washed with 100 cc. of cold water, and air dried. The yield of colorless 2,4-dihydroxy-5-bromobenzoic acid, melting at 206.5–208.5° (corr.), is 40–44 g. (57–63 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The water bath is heated to 70–75°, and one-half of a solution prepared by dissolving 15.8 g. (0.1 mole) of N-nitroso-β-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone in a mixture of 80 ml. of anhydrous ether and 12 ml. of isopropyl alcohol is added through the dropping funnel at a rate slightly greater than that of distillation. When the separatory funnel is empty, an additional 15 ml. of the solution of sodium isopropoxide is added; the remainder of the solution of nitroso compound is then added as before. Anhydrous ether is then added gradually through the dropping funnel until the condensing ether becomes colorless. The diazomethane comes over with the ether as a golden yellow distillate. The process can be continued until all the nitrosoaminoketone has been decomposed. The yield of diazomethane, which varies with the purity of the nitrosoaminoketone, is 1.9–2.5 g (45–60%).
(B) 2,6-Dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide.—The chlorostannate is conveniently oxidized in two batches. In a 3-l. flask is placed a solution of 115 g. (2.9 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 175 cc. of water, 1 kg. of cracked ice is added, and 108 g. (1.52 moles) of chlorine gas is passed into the mixture. About 80 per cent of the ice is melted by the operation. In a 5-l. flask 110 g. (0.127 mole) of the tin salt of 2,6-dibromo-4-aminophenol is dissolved in 1.2 l. of water and 12 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Solution is effected by warming the mixture to 40–50°, after which it is cooled to 15–17° and 600 g. of ice is added. The sodium hypochlorite solution is then added all at once with vigorous stirring (Hood). A yellow precipitate of 2,6-dibromoquinone-4-chloroimide separates immediately, and chlorine is evolved. As soon as the sodium hypochlorite solution has been stirred in, 120 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added in order to keep the tin salts in solution. The fine, yellow precipitate is filtered under the hood on a Büchner funnel and washed with 1.5 l. of 5 per cent hydrochloric acid to remove tin salts and chlorine. The product is dried on a glass tray at 30–40°, or in a vacuum desiccator over sodium hydroxide. From two such batches the yield of chloroimide melting at 80–82° is 126–130 g. (84–87 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the weight of 2,6-dibromo-4-nitrophenol used in Part A).
B. (S)-2-{[(4S)-N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2,2-dimethyl-1,3-oxazolidin-4-yl]-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy}-1,3-thiazole (3) . A 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum is charged with a solution of the alcohol 2 (4.0 g, 12.7 mmol), 99% triethylamine (3.54 mL, 25.5 mmol), and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 0.12 g, 0.98 mmol) in 30 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide and. While the solution is stirred at room temperature, tert-butyldimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (4.38 mL, 19.1 mmol,) is introduced into the reaction flask through the rubber septum using a syringe over a period of 1 min. Caution! tert-Butyldimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate is a toxic compound that should be handled in a well-ventilated fume hood. After stirring at room temperature for 1 hr, 4 mL of methanol is added via syringe. The reaction solution is stirred for an additional 30 min, then the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in 60 mL of hexanes-ethyl acetate (4:1) and washed with 100 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride (NaCl). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 5.18-5.30 g (95-97% crude yield) of 3 as a colorless syrup. Analysis of crude product by 1H NMR indicates a chemical purity of > 98%.
The organic layer of the filtrate is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 40-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are washed with 60 mL of brine and dried over sodium sulfate. The methylene chloride solution is concentrated with a rotary evaporator and the residue is passed through a short column of silica gel (Baker 200 mesh, 400 mL) using 1.5 L of a 9 : 1 (v/v) mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate. The eluent is condensed and distilled; the first fraction (bp 81–85°C/0.6 mm, 2.04 g) is a mixture of isopropylideneacetophenone and acetophenone; the second fraction (bp 85–172°C/0.6 mm, 0.42 g) is a mixture of the above-mentioned substances and the desired product; the third fraction (bp 172–178°C/0.6 mm) gives 14.0–15.2 g (72–78%) of 3,3-dimethyl-1,5-diphenylpentane-1,5-dione.
To the alkaline solution of α-naphthol is now added 1 kg. of cracked ice, the stirrer is started and the diazonium solution run in through a separatory funnel, the stem of which dips below the surface of the solution. The stirring must be uniform and efficient during the addition. The addition of the diazonium solution should take ten minutes. Ice is added if necessary to keep the solution below 10°. The mixture is stirred for one-half hour after the addition of the diazonium solution and then allowed to stand for three hours at 7–10°. It is then filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed with 1 l. of water and sucked as dry as possible.
The resultant residue is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (100 mL) and silica gel (40.0 g) is added to the solution. The CH2Cl2 is then removed under reduced pressure (rotary evaporator, 175 mmHg, 32 °C). Residual solvent is further removed under high vacuum (0.5 mmHg). The resultant free-flowing powder is loaded onto a chromatography column (3.0 inches in diameter) that had been dry-packed with silica (160.0 g). A layer of sand (1.0 inch) was placed on top of the dry silica and a mobile phase (gradient 50%, 75%, 100% EtOAc/Hexanes, 25%, 50%, 75% MeCN/ CH2Cl2, 200 mL each) is passed through the silica, followed by MeCN (400 mL) to flush out the remaining product. The fractions determined to contain product via TLC analysis are combined and concentrated via rotary evaporator. Further solvent removal under high vacuum provides the pure product (2) as a brown solid (7.7 g, 34.5 mmol, 63% yield).
The moist precipitate (120–130 g.) is suspended with mechanical stirring in 1.2–1.3 l. of distilled water, and a hot, 20 per cent aqueous solution of barium hydroxide is added until the mixture is permanently alkaline to phenolphthalein (about 120 cc. is required). A rapid stream of hydrogen sulfide is passed in with stirring until the mercury is completely precipitated. The precipitate is filtered and washed with water until a sample of the washings gives a negative test for tryptophane with bromine water. The barium is removed from the combined filtrate and washings by adding the exact amount of dilute sulfuric acid and filtering. The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to about 80 cc.
The crude product and part of the solvent are distilled at atmospheric pressure. The yield of crude product boiling at 124–128° is 121–131 g. (80–87%) (nD25 1.441–1.444). In order to obtain a pure product, the crude chloroacetonitrile is mixed with 10 g. of phosphorus pentoxide and redistilled through an efficient packed fractionating column. The yield of pure chloroacetonitrile distilling at 123–124° is 93–106 g. (62–70%).
2. By sodium treatment.3 Commercial phenanthrene is treated with maleic anhydride as described above (part 1), and 170 g. of the residue is added to a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a Hershberg mercury-sealed Nichrome stirrer,4 an air condenser, and a thermometer. Ten grams of sodium is added, and the mixture is vigorously stirred at 190–200° for 6 hours. The dark residue is cooled to about 80°, and 300 ml. of benzene is added. The mixture is brought to reflux with stirring and, while still hot, is cautiously filtered through a coarse sintered-glass funnel with gentle suction. The benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the residual phenanthrene is distilled through a small column adapted to the distillation of solids to give 125–130 g. (74–76%) of colorless phenanthrene, b.p. 183–183.5°/15 mm. This product is heated under reflux for 3 hours with about 1.2 l. of 95% ethanol containing approximately 9 g. of Raney nickel catalyst, and the hot solution is filtered as described under paragraph 1. The filtrate on cooling deposits 115–120 g. (68–71%) of colorless phenanthrene, m.p. 97–98°.
B. Catalytic reduction. A hydrogenation bomb of approximately 300 ml. total capacity is charged with 29.5 g. (0.17 mole) of purified phenanthrene; then 70 ml. of cyclohexane and 1.5 g. of copper chromium oxide catalyst are added. The bomb is filled with hydrogen to an initial pressure of 2000 p.s.i. at 20° and heated with shaking to 150° (maximum pressure about 2900 p.s.i.). The hydrogenation proceeds rapidly under these conditions, and about 85% of the theoretical uptake is complete within 1.75–2 hours. The reaction is interrupted at this point, and the catalyst is removed by centrifugation or filtration. The cyclohexane is evaporated, and the residue is distilled through a small column. After a small fore-run (0.2–0.3 g.) distilling below 182°, there is collected 21–23 g.(70–77% yield) of 9,10-dihydrophenanthrene, b.p. 183–184°/25 mm., nD25 1.6401–1.6416. The residue consists of 4.5–5.0 g. (15–17%) of phenanthrene, m.p. 96.5–98°, which may be recycled.
In a 1-gallon (4-l.) bottle are placed 1050 g. (1305 cc., 21.7 moles) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol and 200 g. (1.8 moles) of granulated anhydrous calcium chloride. The mixture is cooled to 8° or below by immersion in ice water, and 500 g. (620 cc., 11.4 moles) of freshly distilled acetaldehyde (b. p. 20–22°) is slowly added down the sides of the bottle so that it forms a layer on the alcoholic calcium chloride. The bottle is then tightly closed with a cork stopper and shaken vigorously for a few minutes. It is then allowed to stand at room temperature with intermittent shaking for one to two days. The mixture divides into two layers after one to two hours; after the first twenty-four hours no appreciable change in volume of the two layers takes place.
The contents of the reaction flask are cooled to room temperature, and the ammonium chloride which separates is filtered off and centrifuged. The mother liquor is concentrated on the steam bath under reduced pressure to 2500 cc., and again cooled to room temperature, whereupon a second crop of ammonium chloride is obtained. The total recovery of ammonium chloride up to this point amounts to 780–815 g.
A. N-p-Tolylsulfinyl-(E)-1-phenylethylideneimine (2). An oven-dried 300-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a rubber septum, is charged with N-p-toluenesulfinamide 1 (5.2 g, 33.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv), acetophenone (8.0 mL, 68.5 mmol, 2.0 equiv), and Ti(OEt)4 (35 mL, 168 mmol, 5.0 equiv) by temporarily removing the septum. A vacuum adaptor is attached to the condenser and the reaction mixture is stirred under vacuum (1 mmHg) for 15 min. A balloon of argon is attached to the adapter at the top of the condensor. The solid is dissolved in CH2Cl2 (75 mL), which is added via syringe through the septum. The solution is heated under reflux for 36 h (external bath temperature 80 °C and internal temperature 40 °C), and the reaction is monitored by TLC. After cooling the solution to 0 °C using an ice bath, MeOH (50 mL), CH2Cl2 (50 mL) and a saturated solution of NaHCO3 (7 mL) are sequentially added with vigorous stirring until precipitation of titanium salts is observed. The solid is vacuum filtered (25 mmHg) through a Büchner funnel and washed with CH2Cl2 (3 × 75 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered into a single-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 10 mmHg) to afford a yellow oil, which is charged onto a silica gel column (8 cm × 18 cm). While collecting fractions of 50 mL, the column is eluted with AcOEt/hexanes (10:90) until acetophenone has completely emerged (volumes of eluents used = 0.6 L). The elution is then continued with AcOEt/hexanes (50:50). The product-containing fractions (total volume of eluent used for this product = 1.7 L) are concentrated and successively recrystallized from CH2Cl2/hexanes to afford N-sulfinylketimine 2 (5.78 g, 67%) as a white solid.
The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for 1–2 hours (or overnight, if more convenient); after this interval the solution will have assumed a clear, pale yellow color. The condenser is then set for downward distillation, stirring is resumed, and the solvent is removed by distillation from a steam bath. After nearly all the ether has been removed, the distillation is continued under reduced pressure (40–50 mm.) until no further appearance of crystals is noted. The residue, which consists of yellow crystals of the crude product, is then allowed to stand until dry in a vacuum desiccator which contains concentrated sulfuric acid, soda lime, and anhydrous calcium chloride.
Warm (80°) dry toluene (150 ml.) is added to the melt, and stirring is continued for 5 minutes. The entire mass is quickly poured into a dry beaker and slowly stirred, manually, until the entire mass has crystallized. The cool toluene is decanted rapidly, and 150 ml. of warm toluene is added. The mixture is heated sufficiently to melt the crystals (about 68°), then allowed to cool again with stirring. The toluene is decanted once more, and 150 ml. of hot (60°) dry benzene is added. The mass is melted once more and cooled with stirring. The crystalline mass, with the benzene layer still covering it, is transferred rapidly to a Büchner funnel sufficiently large to hold all the contents of the beaker. The funnel is immediately covered with a rubber diaphragm, and suction is applied. The crystals are quickly covered with 150 ml. of dry methylene chloride, dried with suction, and quickly transferred into a glass vacuum oven at 50°. The yield of N-chlorobetainyl chloride is 337–344 g. (98–100%) of 98–100% purity if moisture was rigorously excluded.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are mixed 152 g. (2 moles) of finely divided thiourea and 70 cc. of water. To this is added 138 g. (1.1 moles) of technical methyl sulfate. The flask is immediately attached to a long reflux condenser carrying a trap. The reaction is allowed to progress spontaneously, with occasional cooling as the reaction becomes more rapid and the flask becomes filled with vapor. After the initial vigorous reaction is completed, the mixture is refluxed for one hour, during which time crystallization takes place. The mixture is then allowed to cool, the flask is removed, 200 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added, and the contents of the flask are then filtered with suction. The residue is washed twice with 100-cc. portions of 95 per cent alcohol and allowed to dry in air. The yield is 190 g. of a product which melts with decomposition at 235°. Another crop of crystals weighing 43 g. and melting at 230° can be obtained from the alcoholic filtrate by concentrating it to a paste to which, after cooling, is added 120 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. The total yield is 220–233 g. (79–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
C. 2-Methoxymethoxy-1-nonen-3-ol. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a three-way stopcock connected to a mineral oil bubbler. The flask is evacuated, purged with nitrogen, and charged with 200 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and 8.83 g of methoxymethyl vinyl ether (100 mmol). The solution is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice-acetone bath, and then 88.7 mL (100 mmol) of sec-butyllithium (1.13 M in cyclohexane) is added dropwise over 15 min with stirring via syringe. After the addition is complete, the yellow mixture is allowed to warm to −30°C over 30 min and stir for 1 hr. The mixture is recooled to −78°C and 11.44 g (100 mmol) of heptanal is added dropwise over 5 min through the dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 30 min and to stir for 3 hr. A 100-mL portion of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution is added, the mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, mixed thoroughly, and the organic layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted three times with 50 mL of diethyl ether. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure to afford 12.6–13.1 g (62–65%) of 2-methoxymethoxy-1-nonen-3-ol as a colorless liquid, bp 82–84°C (0.4 mm).
A. (4-methylphenyl)magnesium bromide. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser protected by a drying tube, a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a 250-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a gas-inlet tube is thoroughly purged with dry nitrogen and charged with 6.25 g. (0.256 g.-atom) of magnesium turnings and 50 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 42.7 g. (30.5 ml., 0.250 mole) of 4-bromotoluene in 100 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. Approximately 10 ml. of the 4-bromotoluene solution is added to the flask, and the contents are stirred until the Grignard reaction commences. When the initial vigorous reaction has subsided the remainder of the 4-bromotoluene solution is added at a rate such that the mixture refluxes gently. Generally the addition is complete at the end of 1 hour, and almost all of the magnesium has dissolved. The mixture is refluxed for a further hour and cooled. The yield of (4-methylphenyl)magnesium bromide is about 95%.
A. Magnesium enolate of 2-methyl-1-tetralone. Into a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 6.72 g of magnesium bromide diethyl etherate (MgBr2·Et2O) (26.0 mmol) under nitrogen. Anhydrous ether, 350 mL, is added with a syringe, and the mixture is stirred at 25°C for a few minutes to dissolve the solid. Using an air-tight syringe, 11.2 mL of a 3.0 M solution of methylmagnesium bromide in ether (34 mmol,) is added to the slightly turbid solution at 25°C over a period of a few minutes. N,N-Diisopropylamine, 4.46 mL (34 mmol,) is added over 5 min, and the mixture is stirred for 16–18 hr, during which time a fine white precipitate forms. The mixture is cooled to 0°C, and a solution of 5.28 g of 2-methyl-1-tetralone (33 mmol,) in 20 mL of anhydrous ether is added with a cannula over a 10-min period. The mixture becomes a bright yellow solution during the addition, and after 45 min of additional stirring, it becomes pale yellow.
B. 4,5,6,7-Tetrahydroindazole. A solution of 63 g. (0.5 mole) of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone and 500 ml. of methyl alcohol contained in a 2-l. beaker is treated with 25 ml. (0.5 mole) of hydrazine hydrate in small portions. After standing for 30 minutes the mixture is concentrated by warming under reduced pressure on the steam bath. To aid in removing the water, 100 ml. of ethyl alcohol is added, and again the mixture is concentrated by heating under reduced pressure. The residue is dissolved in about 100 ml. of hot petroleum ether, and after cooling in an ice bath for 1 hour the solid that separates is collected by suction filtration and washed with a small amount of cold petroleum ether. The crude 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindazole, m.p. 79–80°, weighs 58–60 g. (95–98%) and is sufficiently pure to be used in the next step and.
When all the sodium has dissolved, the condenser is removed and 584 g. (4 moles) of diethyl oxalate and 312 g. (1 mole) of ethyl stearate are quickly added. The condenser is replaced by a still head connected to a condenser and receiver arranged for distillation at reduced pressure. If a water aspirator is used, a drying tube filled with Drierite should be inserted in the line between the receiver and aspirator. The receiver is cooled in a bath of ice water. The reaction mixture is heated at 50°, and the pressure in the system is reduced to about 100 mm. The temperature is gradually raised to 60°, with the system at a pressure of 100 ± 10 mm., to remove the ethanol used as solvent and formed as by-product. This distillation requires 2–3 hours.
To the deep-red solution is added 550 g. of sodium hydrosulfite (of at least 80 per cent purity); the mixture is stirred for five minutes and then for five thirty-second periods during one-half hour. The solution slowly loses its red color (a thin layer of aniline collects on the surface), and the temperature rises from 25–50°. At the end of one-half hour the solution should no longer be red; it is then rapidly cooled to 20° in a freezing bath and by the addition of about 500 g. of ice.
B. (3,5-Dimethoxy-1-phenyl-cyclohexa-2,5-dienyl)-acetonitrile. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar. The central neck of the reaction flask is fitted with a large cold-finger condenser. The flask with the condenser is heated in an oven overnight (120 °C). The two remaining necks are closed with ground-glass stoppers and the hot glassware is connected via the cold-finger condenser to a vacuum-nitrogen line. Vacuum is applied until the glassware is cooled down to room temperature and the glassware is flushed with nitrogen. Biaryl 1 (6.08 g, 28.4 mmol) is introduced under nitrogen, and dissolved in anhydrous THF (100 mL). A T-joint with a bubbler for exhaust is introduced between the vacuum-nitrogen line and the cold-finger condenser. One ground-glass stopper is exchanged with a gas inlet valve connected to an ammonia tank the other stopper with an internal thermometer. The flask and the cold-finger condenser are cooled to -78 °C (bath temperature) using acetone and dry-ice, then ammonia (200 mL approximately) is condensed. The gas inlet is replaced with a stopper and lithium (435 mg, 62.7 mmol, 2.21 equiv) is added portion wise at -78 °C under a nitrogen flow during 10 min. During lithium addition the solution turns rapidly brown and finally brick red. After 45 minutes of stirring at this temperature, one of the glass stoppers is replaced by a septum and a cold solution of chloroacetonitrile (5.40 mL, 85.3 mmol, 3.00 equiv) in anhydrous THF (20 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min, keeping the temperature below -70 °C. The mixture turns immediately brown. After 20 min of stirring, the reaction is quenched by addition of solid ammonium chloride (3.50 g). The cooling bath and condenser are removed and ammonia is allowed to evaporate under air. When the reaction mixture has reached room temperature, a saturated ammonium chloride solution (150 mL) is added, followed by water (50 mL). The aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 × 100 mL) in a 1-L separating funnel. The combined organic phases are washed with brine (150 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (2 g) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (125 mmHg, 40 °C, then 15 mmHg). The resulting brown paste (8.20 g) is purified by flash chromatography. After concentration of the product-containing fractions on a rotary evaporator and drying under vacuum (0.1 mmHg), the bis-enol ether is obtained in 2 fractions: white solid (5.11 g) with mp = 101.0-102.0 °C, off-white fraction (1.17 g) with mp = 98.0-99.0 °C (total yield: 6.28-6.65 g, 87-88%).
A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser with a tube leading to a flask of water for absorption of hydrogen bromide, and a separatory funnel with a stem drawn to a fine tip which reaches almost to the blades of the stirrer. In the flask are placed 160 g. (1 mole) of diethyl malonate and 150 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. In the separatory funnel is placed 165 g. (53 cc., 1.03 moles) of dry bromine. The stirrer is started, and a few cubic centimeters of bromine are run into the solution. A large electric bulb is held under the flask until the reaction starts. Then the rest of the bromine is added gradually at such a rate as to keep the liquid boiling gently. It is then refluxed until no more hydrogen bromide is evolved (about one hour).
The solution of semicarbazide sulfate is removed from the cell and filtered. The filtered solution is concentrated under reduced pressure on a water bath to a volume of 125–150 cc. Meanwhile, considerable semicarbazide sulfate will have crystallized. The mixture is cooled thoroughly in ice and the crystals are collected on a hardened filter paper, or better, on a filtros plate (see Note 5, on p. 11), and washed several times with absolute alcohol to remove sulfuric acid. The crystals are dried on clay plate or paper. The yield is 50–57 g. (61–69 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 144–145° with decomposition.
In a 5-l. flask, fitted with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, is placed 1 kg. (1266 cc.) of absolute ethyl alcohol (p. 249 and p. 259); 92 g. (4 atoms) of sodium, cut into strips, is then added through the condenser at such a rate that the alcohol does not boil too vigorously. When all the sodium is in solution, the flask is cooled and 800 g. (754 cc., 5 moles) of diethyl malonate added through the condenser, with stirring. The mixture is warmed gently on the steam bath and 700 g. (658 cc., 4.1 moles) of diethyl fumarate added from the dropping funnel. During this addition the solution is kept boiling gently, heat being applied if necessary. The mixture is boiled for one hour after the diethyl fumarate has been added. It is then cooled and 250 g. (238 cc., 4.2 moles) of glacial acetic acid is added.
In a 1-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, a thermometer for reading low temperatures, and a dropping funnel, are placed 98 g. (2 moles) of pulverized sodium cyanide and 200 cc. of water. The stirrer is started, and 60 g. of paraformaldehyde (2 moles) is added in small quantities until the temperature rises to 20–25° and the sodium cyanide has dissolved. The flask is then surrounded by a freezing mixture, and the temperature is kept below 25° during the introduction of the remaining paraformaldehyde.
4-Methoxy-2'-methylbiphenyl . o-Tolylboronic acid, 10.0 g (73.6 mmol), 16.8 g (71.8 mmol) of 4-iodoanisole, and 200 mL of acetone are combined in a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with an efficient stirbar, two stoppers, and a reflux condenser attached to a gas-flow adapter with a stopcock. Potassium carbonate, 25.0 g (0.180 mol), is dissolved in 200 mL of water in a separate 250-mL Schlenk flask. In a third flask (25-mL Schlenk flask) 3.30 mg (0.02 mmol, 0.2%) of palladium acetate is dissolved in 10 mL of acetone . All three flasks are then thoroughly degassed by four freeze-pump-thaw cycles. Under an argon back flow, one of the stoppers on the three-necked flask is replaced with a rubber septum, and the carbonate and catalyst solutions are added via cannula to form a biphasic mixture. The top layer turns brown upon addition of the catalyst. The septum is replaced with the glass stopper and three additional freeze-pump-thaw cycles are applied. The flask is then backfilled with argon, and the reaction is brought to reflux under a positive argon pressure. After 2 hr at reflux the heat source is removed and the reaction is allowed to cool. By this time the brown color has faded and the reaction is a triphasic mixture with copious amounts of palladium black floating between the layers. The reaction is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted into diethyl ether (3 × 100 mL). The organic layers are combined, washed with water (1 × 100 mL) saturated with sodium chloride , and dried over magnesium sulfate . Solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator to yield a yellow oil which is distilled (125-130°C, 0.10 mm) to give 12.8 g of 4-methoxy-2'-methylbiphenyl as a colorless oil (90.3% yield).
D. (2R,3R)-2,3-Dimethylbutane-1,4-diol (5). An oven-dried, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a rubber septum, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, a reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet adapter, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is charged with 0.857 g (22.6 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride and THF (56 mL). (CAUTION: lithium aluminum hydride is very reactive and must be handled carefully to avoid contact with water). The resulting suspension is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath, and a solution of (2R,3R)-2,3- dimethylsuccinic acid (1.10 g, 7.53 mmol) in THF (24 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min from the dropping funnel, which is rinsed with THF (4 mL). The resulting suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath for 12 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0 °C (bath temperature) in an ice-water bath and is diluted with ethyl ether (80 mL). Water (0.9 mL) is added dropwise slowly, followed after 5 min by 3 M aq. sodium hydroxide solution (0.9 mL) and, after 5 min, more water (2.6 mL). The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and is stirred at this temperature for 2 h. The white precipitate is removed by filtration of the mixture through a ceramic Büchner funnel lined with filter paper (Whatman 90 mm thick qualitative circles) fitted onto a 100-mL filter flask. The white residue is transferred to a 50-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. After breaking the precipitate into small pieces with a metal spatula, THF (20 mL) is added and then the suspension is heated at reflux in a mineral oil bath with vigorous stirring for 60 min. The precipitate is removed by filtration through a medium-porosity, glass-fritted Büchner funnel into a 100-mL filter flask and is washed with ethyl ether (3 × 20 mL). The combined filtrates are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate (6 g), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (25 °C, 40 mmHg) to afford the crude product as a light yellow oil. The product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation to afford 0.80 g (90%) of (2R,3R)-2,3-dimethylbutane-1,4-diol as a viscous, clear oil.
A solution of 59.6 g. (0.1 mole) of 3,12-diacetoxy-bisnor-cholanyldiphenylethylene (p. 237) in 60 ml. of chloroform is prepared by warming and poured into a 1-l. round-bottomed flask containing 300 ml. of glacial acetic acid at about 40°. The flask is provided with a stirrer, a thermometer dipping below the surface of the solution, and a dropping funnel, and is surrounded by a water bath through which cold water can be circulated. A solution of 37 g. of chromium trioxide in 30 ml. of water and 200 ml. of acetic acid is added from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature is kept at about 50°; the mixture is stirred and cooled. This operation should require about 10 minutes. When the temperature starts to drop, the water bath is warmed and the temperature is maintained at about 50° for an additional 20 minutes. The solution is then cooled, and the excess chromic acid is destroyed by adding carefully about 30 ml. of methanol, the temperature being kept below 50°.
In a 500-cc. three-necked flask, fitted with a stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel, is placed 100 g. (1 mole) of chromic anhydride dissolved in 100 cc. of water, and 100 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added. The α-chlorohydrindene is then admitted through the funnel at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 35–40°, the flask being cooled externally. This addition takes about one and one-half hours; after it is complete, stirring is continued for fifteen minutes before the mixture is poured into a large beaker and diluted with 300 cc. of water. After the acid present is neutralized by the addition of solid sodium carbonate, the α-hydrindone is expelled from the mixture by steam distillation, care being taken to avoid entrainment of froth at the beginning of the process. When about 2.5 l. of distillate has been collected, the solution again begins to froth. The operation is stopped at this point, since further distillation does not yield an appreciable quantity of product. The α-hydrindone usually solidifies, as soon as the distillate is chilled, to a mixture of colorless crystals and a yellow solid; the product is collected after thorough cooling in an ice bath. This moist solid is dissolved in 200 cc. of benzene, and the solution is subjected to distillation until free from water. After the benzene is removed by vacuum distillation on the steam bath, the α-hydrindone is distilled. It boils at 125–126°/17 mm., and the distillate is a pale yellow solid, m.p. 39–41°. The yield is 46–55 g. (50–60 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the indene used) and.
Sixty grams (0.4 mole) of piperonal and 1.5 l. of water are placed in a 5-l. flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer. The flask is placed on a steam bath, heated to 70–80°, and the stirrer started. A solution of 90 g. (0.56 mole) of potassium permanganate in 1.8 l. of water is allowed to flow into the emulsion of piperonal and water over a period of forty to forty-five minutes. The stirring and heating are continued for an hour longer, at the end of which time the permanganate is reduced. Enough 10 per cent potassium hydroxide solution is added to make the solution alkaline. The mixture is filtered while hot, and the manganese dioxide is washed with three 200-cc. portions of hot water. The combined filtrate and washings are cooled. At this point any unreacted piperonal that separates must be filtered. The solution is now acidified with hydrochloric acid, the acid being added until no further precipitate forms. The resulting piperonylic acid is filtered, washed with cold water until free of chlorides, and dried. The yield is 60–64 g. (90–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless product melting at 224–225° (corr.). For most purposes the crude material is pure enough, but it may be crystallized from ten times its weight of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, yielding 52–56 g. (78–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of needles melting at 227–228° (corr.).
A 1-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed Hershberg stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 650 ml. of acetic anhydride, and 107 g. (107 ml., 1 mole) of o-toluidine is introduced from the dropping funnel. The mixture becomes very warm. After the amine has been completely added, the solution is cooled to 12–13° in an ice-salt bath. During the cooling, the dropping funnel and condenser are replaced by another dropping funnel containing 126 ml. (2 moles) of 70% nitric acid and a thermometer which can be read to within 0.5° in the range from 10° to 20°.
A. o-Hydrazinobenzoic acid hydrochloride. In a 2-l. beaker, provided with a stirrer and a low-temperature thermometer, and cooled in an ice-salt bath, are placed 42 g. (0.31 mole) of anthranilic acid and 300 ml. of water. The stirrer is started, and 340 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added in one portion; the anthranilic acid dissolves, and its hydrochloride begins to separate almost immediately. After the mixture has been cooled to 0°, a solution of 21.6 g. (0.31 mole) of technical sodium nitrite in 210 ml. of water is added from a dropping funnel, the tip of which extends below the surface of the suspension, at such a rate that the temperature never rises above 3°. The addition requires about 30 minutes; stirring is continued for 15 minutes longer, and at the end of this period a positive test with starch-iodide paper should be obtained. The clear brown solution is then diluted with 150 ml. of ice water.
A 6-L Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar is charged with 1 L of chloroform and a solution of the disodium salt (0.46–0.50 mol) in 800 mL of water. The two-phase mixture is stirred rapidly as 2.00 equiv (920–1000 mL, 0.92–1.00 mol) of cold 1 M hydrochloric acid is added. The layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 500-mL portions of chloroform. The combined organic layers are washed once with saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure by rotary evaporation, keeping the water bath temperature at or below 40°C. Crystallization of the remaining waxy solid from 2 : 1 hexane–ethyl acetate affords 158–171 g (54–59% based on dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate) of the tetraester, mp 97–100°C.
The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with three 30-ml. portions of cold water. The alloxantin is dissolved by boiling the wet solid for 15 minutes with 250 ml. of water, and the hot solution is filtered to remove the sulfur. Alloxantin dihydrate crystallizes from the filtrate in glistening plates which should be pressed as dry as possible on a Büchner filter, washed with about 30 ml. of ether, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield is 8–10 g. (55–69%). The product melts with decomposition at 234–238°, and is pure enough for most purposes.
The solvent and excess dimethyl carbonate are removed by rotary evaporation, and the remaining yellow liquid (13.2 g of 2) is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser. An aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (10%, 60 mL) is added to the flask, and the mixture is heated with magnetic stirring in an oil bath at reflux temperature for 4.5 hr. The course of the reaction is monitored by gas-chromatographic analysis. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is extracted with diethyl ether to remove nonacidic material (primarily traces of amide). An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid (15%, 50 mL) is added portionwise. The suspension that forms is poured into a 250-mL separatory funnel and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with water (60 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (25 g). After filtration, the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation, and the yellow liquid residue is distilled from a 25-mL flask, under reduced pressure, in a Claisen apparatus equipped with a 2-cm Vigreux column and a fused-on Liebig condenser. Distillation affords 2-phenylpropionic acid (3) (14.3 g, 93%) as a pale-yellow liquid, bp 93-94°C/0.9 mm (lit.2 bp 147°C/11 mm), with > 98% purity by gas chromatography.
The ice-cold fluoboric acid solution is added rather rapidly, with stirring, to the diazonium solution while the temperature is kept below 10°. A thick paste of p-carbethoxybenzenediazonium fluoborate precipitates; stirring is continued for twenty to thirty minutes. The solid is filtered on an 18.5-cm. Büchner funnel and washed consecutively with 300 cc. of cold water, 300 cc. of commercial methyl alcohol, and 200 cc. of commercial ether; it is sucked as dry as possible between washings. The fluoborate is then dried over concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of the dried fluoborate is 198–205 g. (75–78 per cent of the theoretical amount); the decomposition point is 93–94°.
This product is satisfactory for most purposes. It may be obtained in a crystalline condition, however, by recrystallizing from hot ligroin (b.p. 60–90°). About 2 g. of nitroso-β-naphthol will dissolve in 15 cc. of boiling ligroin. The product is not very soluble in cold ligroin, so that nearly all is recovered.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 192 g. (166 ml., 2 moles) of freshly distilled furfural, 208 g. (2 moles) of malonic acid, and 96 ml. (1.2 moles) of pyridine. The flask is heated on a boiling water bath for 2 hours, and the reaction mixture is cooled and diluted with 200 ml. of water. The acid is dissolved by the addition of concentrated aqueous ammonia, the solution is filtered through a fluted filter paper, and the paper is washed with three 80-ml. portions of water. The combined filtrates are acidified with an excess of diluted (1:1) hydrochloric acid with stirring. The mixture is cooled by running water and then allowed to stand in an ice bath for at least 1 hour. The furylacrylic acid is filtered, washed with four 100-ml portions of water, and dried. The yield of practically colorless needles melting at 141° is 252–254 g. (91–92%). If a purer product is desired, recrystallization is best effected from dilute alcohol. On slow cooling of the solution, needles melting at 141° separate.
C. 1,3-Bis(methylthio)-1-hexen-4-ol. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask containing a Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar and equipped with a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a side arm connected to a nitrogen bubbler system is charged with 11.65 g. (0.1153 mole) of diisopropylamine and 175 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran. The flask is flushed with nitrogen, and a slight positive pressure is maintained with a slow stream of nitrogen during the following operation. The solution is magnetically stirred and cooled to about −75° with an acetone-dry ice bath. After 15 minutes, 77.0 ml. (0.112 mole) of 1.45 M solution of n-butyllithium butyllithium in hexane is added dropwise, using the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. While the resulting solution of lithium diisopropylamide is stirred at −75°, 9.15 g. (0.0551 mole) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-methoxypropane is added through a dropping funnel. The acetone–dry ice bath is replaced with an ice-water bath, and the solution is stirred at 0° for 2.5 hours. The solution slowly becomes deep purple in color as 1,3-bis(methylthio)allyllithium is generated.
After the preparation of ethylmagnesium bromide is completed, the separatory funnel is replaced by a bent tube which reaches the bottom of the flask and is bent at the outer end for downward delivery. The warm (40–50°) solution is forced under nitrogen pressure (by carefully pinching off the tube to the mercury bubbler) into the 500-ml. separatory funnel which has been prepared for attachment to the 1-l. flask. After all the solution has passed into the separatory funnel, nitrogen flow is allowed to continue briefly in order to displace the air above the solution, then the funnel is stoppered loosely and attached to the 1-l. flask. Two hundred milliliters of purified tetrahydrofuran is now placed in the flask, acetylene is introduced through the gas-inlet tube at the rate of 15–20 l. per hour, and the stirrer is started. After 5 minutes, about 5 ml. of the solution of ethylmagnesium bromide is added in 1 portion. Almost at once, there appears a froth of ethane which is easily distinguishable from the larger bubbles of acetylene. When the frothing subsides, portionwise addition of the ethylmagnesium bromide solution is continued until the total solution has been added. This requires about 3 hours, and the temperature of the reaction rises 5–10° above room temperature. The solution of ethynylmagnesium bromide is homogeneous at 30°.
To a solution of 1200 g. (4.8 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate and 400 g. (6.9 moles) of sodium chloride in 4 l. of water at 60–70° is added a concentrated solution of 200 g. (1.7–1.8 moles) of (90–95 per cent) sodium bisulfite (prepared if desired by saturating a solution of 100 g. of sodium carbonate with sulfur dioxide). The white precipitate of cuprous chloride is filtered off, sucked dry as rapidly as possible, and suspended in a mixture of 2 l. of water and 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19).
A. Oximinomalononitrile. Malononitrile (25 g., 0.38 mole) is dissolved in a mixture of 20 ml. of water and 100 ml. of acetic acid in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and a powder funnel. The solution is cooled to −10° with a dry ice-acetone bath, and 50 g. (0.72 mole) of granulated sodium nitrite is added in approximately 2-g. portions over a 30-minute period while the temperature is maintained at 0° to −10°. After the addition is complete a wet ice bath is used to maintain the temperature below 5° while the mixture is stirred for 4 hours. Four hundred milliliters of tetrahydrofuran and 400 ml. of ether are added in separate portions, and the mixture is stored at −40° overnight. The mixture is filtered rapidly, and the solid is washed with a mixture of 200 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and 200 ml. of ether. The filtrate and washings are combined and concentrated by distillation to a volume of 250 ml. by the use of a water aspirator and a bath at 40°. This solution of oximinomalononitrile is used directly in the next step.
B. 2-Methyl-2-vinylcyclopentanone. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a nitrogen inlet tube, and a rubber septum is kept under dry nitrogen. To this flask are introduced 8.3 mL (5.99 g, 0.0591 mol) of diisopropylamine and 120 mL of tetrahydrofuran with a syringe through the septum. The flask is cooled in a dry ice–hexane bath. To the solution is slowly added 38.7 mL of butyllithium (1.53 M in hexane, 0.0592 mol) with a syringe and the mixture is kept at 0°C (in an ice bath) for 10 min. The resulting solution of lithium diisopropylamide is again cooled in a dry ice–hexane bath (−78°C), and 11.2 mL (11.57 g, 0.0645 mol) of N,N'-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU) is added. After stirring for 30 min, 6.47 mL (6.15 g, 0.0539 mol) of methyl tiglate is injected drop by drop at −78°C. After the solution is stirred for an additional 20 min, 13.0 g (0.0537 mol) of 1-iodo-3-trimethylsilylpropane 1 is added with a syringe and the dry ice–hexane bath is replaced with an ice bath. The solution is stirred at about 0°C for 1 hr and then poured onto 150 mL of ice-cooled 3 N hydrochloric acid covered with 150 mL of hexane. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 80-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic layers are washed successively with 50 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid and 50 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator to afford the crude ester 2 (ca. 13 g), which is sufficiently pure for the next operation.
After the last alkaline extract has been run into the receiving funnel, this is shaken and the aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The light-yellow ethereal layer is run into a smaller funnel and shaken with 100 ml. of 5% sodium carbonate solution and 30 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution. This extraction is repeated a second time. The carbonate extract is either discarded or worked up for recovery of acidic oxidation products. The ethereal solution is finally shaken with 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution, filtered into a round-bottomed flask by gravity through a paper containing 25 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. The residue is initially an oil, but when the last traces of solvent are removed by evacuating the flask, reheating, and re-evacuating, it is obtained as a yellow solid (about 13 g.). This is taken up in 125 ml. of boiling methanol, and crystallization is allowed to proceed, first at room temperature and then at 0°. Δ4-Cholesten-3,6-dione separates in glistening, thin, yellow plates, m.p. 124–125°; yield in the first crop, 9.0–9.3 g. Concentration of the filtrate affords a second crop of 0.7–1.2 g., melting in the range 118–121.5°; total yield, 10.0–10.2 g. (39–40%).
The dark reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, transferred to a separatory funnel, and extracted with 225 ml. of ether. The ether extract is washed with four 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate or magnesium sulfate. The mixture is filtered, the ether is removed by distillation, and the residual liquid is fractionated under reduced pressure from a modified Claisen flask. The yield of colorless 4,4'-dichlorodibutyl ether, b.p. 84–86°/0.5 mm. (116–118°/10 mm.), nD25 1.4562, d425 1.0690, is 257–268 g. (52–54% based on tetrahydrofuran).
The filtrate is placed in a 5-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, cooled in an ice bath to 10°, and a solution of 55 g. (1.37 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 55 cc. of water added. The temperature being kept at 10°, 94 g. (0.67 mole) of benzoyl chloride is added dropwise from a separatory funnel over a period of thirty-five to forty minutes, with rapid stirring. The mixture is stirred for an hour longer, filtered, and placed in a 4-l. beaker. The cold filtrate is slowly acidified to Congo red by adding 10 per cent hydrochloric acid, with hand stirring (about 450 cc. of acid is required). The solid is filtered with suction, washed with water, and spread out to dry. When dry, the product is washed with two 100-cc. portions of petroleum ether (35–60°) to remove the admixed benzoic acid. The adhering petroleum ether is allowed to evaporate from the crystals, and the final drying is carried out in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid. The yield of purified product, m.p. 77–80°, is 135–150 g. (65–72 per cent of the calculated amount, based on cyclohexanone oxime).
A dry, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and two 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnels. One of the dropping funnels is fitted with a rubber septum and the air in the system is replaced with dry nitrogen. The flask is charged with 400 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and 51.6 g (71.5 mL, 0.51 mol) of anhydrous diisopropylamine. The flask is cooled to 0°C with an ice bath. A 1.7 M hexane solution of butyllithium (288 mL, 0.49 mol) is added dropwise with stirring over a 30-min period. The resulting lithium diisopropylamide is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice–acetone bath. A solution of 53.9 g (0.385 mol) of 3-ethoxy-2-cyclohexen-1-one in 250 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise with stirring at −78°C over a 1-hr period. The solution is stirred at −78°C for 30 min followed by the rapid addition of 114 g (50 mL, 0.80 mol) of methyl iodide. After 5 min, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred overnight. The reaction is quenched with 300 mL of water and the organic phase is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted four times with 75 mL of diethyl ether. The organic phases are combined and washed twice with 150 mL of water, once with 150 mL of brine, and dried over magnesium sulfate. Solvent removal on a rotary evaporator followed by distillation at reduced pressure affords 54–55 g (91–93%) of 3-ethoxy-6-methyl-2-cyclohexen-1-one as a colorless oil, bp 131–133°C (15 mm) and.
C. 4-Methylpyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet, a glass stopper, a stopcock gas inlet and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirbar is evacuated and flame-dried before it is flushed with argon and allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The flask is charged with 1-(2-(1-propynyl)phenyl)pyrrole (4.53 g, 25 mmol), toluene (100 mL, Note 1) and InCl3 (277 mg, 1.25 mmol, Note 10) and the resulting mixture is stirred at 80 °C bath temperature for 4 h until GC analysis shows complete conversion of the substrate. For workup, the dark mixture is filtered through a pad of silica gel (5 cm × 3 cm, approximately 30 g), which is then carefully rinsed with toluene (150 mL). The crude product was obtained as a yellow solid after removal of the solvent under reduced pressure. The product is dissolved in toluene (20 mL) and this solution is adsorbed on silica gel (approximately 10 g) and the resulting slurry is evaporated to dryness. The adsorbate is placed in a Soxhlet thimble (8.0 cm × 3.5 cm) and is extracted with pentane (80 mL, Note 1) for 18 h using a Soxhlet apparatus of ca. 50 mL inner volume. Evaporation of the resulting pentane extract provides 4-methylpyrrolo[1,2-a]quinoline as a pale yellow solid, which is pure enough for most applications (mp 63–65°C, ≥95% by GC, Note 11) (4.12 g, 91%). Analytically pure material is obtained by subsequent sublimation (60 °C bath temperature, 5 × 10−3 mmHg for 3.5 h, Note 13) as a white solid (3.05 g, 67%, Notes 14-16), mp 67–68 °C.
B. Cyclopropylbenzene. In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer extending into the flask but free from the stirrer are placed 500 ml. of redistilled dimethylformamide and zinc-copper couple prepared from 131 g. (2 g. atoms) of zinc. The mixture is cooled to 7° in an ice bath, and 1,3-dibromo-1-phenylpropane is added to the stirred mixture at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 7–9°. The mixture is stirred for 30 minutes after the addition is completed, poured into 1 l. of water, and then steam-distilled until the condensate is homogeneous or 1 l. of water has been collected. The organic layer is separated from the distillate, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic portions are washed with four 50-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure at water bath temperature. The residue is distilled to give 88–100 g. (75–85%) of cyclopropylbenzene, b.p. 170–175°, n26D 1.5306–1.5318.
A. N-[2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]acetamide. Into an oven-dried, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that contains a magnetic stirring bar, 25-mL addition funnel, condenser, and thermometer, is placed 15.75 g (0.15 mol) of 2-(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol in 20 mL of anhydrous ethanol. Acetic anhydride (15.75 g, 0.154 mol) is slowly dripped into this stirring solution while the temperature is kept at or below 40°C. The resulting mixture is stirred under reflux for 15 min. The mixture is evaporated on a rotary evaporator to give a pale yellow oil that is distilled through a short path apparatus containing a 2-cm Vigreux column to give 20.3–21.5 g (92–97%) of product, bp 135–139°C/0.12 mm.
C. L-Allylglycine . A 1-L, single-neck, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient reflux condenser, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a heating mantle is charged with 25.0 g (0.0953 mol) of pseudoephedrine L-allylglycinamide and 500 mL of water. The resulting suspension is heated to reflux, causing the solids to dissolve to afford a colorless, homogeneous solution. After 10 hr at reflux, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 23°C, whereupon (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine is observed to crystallize. Concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution (10 mL) is added, whereupon the resulting aqueous slurry is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted with three 200-mL portions of dichloromethane , reserving the aqueous layer. The three organic layers are individually and sequentially extracted with a single aqueous solution prepared by combining 250 mL of water and 5 mL of concentrated aqueous ammonium hydroxide solution. The aqueous extract is combined with the aqueous extract reserved earlier and the resulting solution is concentrated under reduced pressure to provide a white solid residue. The solid is triturated, sequentially, with one 100-mL and one 50-mL portion of absolute ethanol . The triturated solid is collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to afford 10.2 g (93%) of L-allylglycine of ≥99% ee. If desired, (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine can be recovered from the organic extracts. The organic extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a solid. The solid is recrystallized by dissolving it in a minimum volume of hot water (ca. 350 mL). The resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23°C, by which time extensive crystallization of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine has occurred. The recrystallization flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. After standing at 0°C for 1 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to afford 10.8 g of pure (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine (mp 116-117°C). The mother liquors are concentrated and a second crop of crystals (2.6 g, total yield 13.4 g, 85%) is obtained in a similar manner by recrystallization from ca. 75 mL of water.
The crude product is dissolved in a mixture of 320 ml. of benzene and 80 ml. of ligroin (b.p. 60–90°) and heated on a steam bath with 5 g. of Norit and 2 g. of sodium hydrosulfite for 20 minutes. The hot solution is filtered by gravity, allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, and then chilled overnight in a refrigerator. The product is isolated by gravity filtration, washed on the filter with 25 ml. of ligroin, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of white crystals melting at 63–64° amounts to 28–30 g. (61–65%). By concentrating the combined filtrate and washings to a volume of 150 ml., an additional 2–3g. of pale yellow crystals melting at 62–64° can be obtained. The total yield of 3-aminopyridine is 30–33 g. (65–71%).
C. Diazomethane. Sodium cyclohexoxide method. A solution of sodium cyclohexoxide is prepared from 4 g. of sodium and 100 ml. of cyclohexanol in a 2-l. flask; the cyclohexanol is heated to boiling under reflux to speed up the formation of the alkoxide. As soon as the sodium has disappeared, heating is discontinued and the condenser is removed. When solid begins to separate from the solution, the mixture is stirred with a stout rod to prevent the formation of a hard cake. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and, when the temperature of the mixture has dropped to 10°, 300 ml. of dry ether and a solution of 49 g. (0.33 mole) of N-nitroso-β-methylaminoisobutyl methyl ketone dissolved in 600 ml. of dry ether are added. The flask is connected to a 25-cm. fractionating column and an efficient water-cooled condenser. The delivery end of the condenser should be connected to an adapter which dips below the surface of 50 ml. of ether contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask immersed in an ice bath. The mixture is heated by a water bath whose temperature is maintained at 50–55°. Distillation is continued until the condensing ether is colorless; usually 700–750 ml. of distillate containing 10–11 g. (77–84% yield) of diazomethane is collected and. The diazomethane-ether solution may be purified further with only slight loss by drying over potassium hydroxide pellets and redistillation through a fractionating column.
A solution of 14.8 g. (0.20 mole) of t-butyl alcohol in 125 ml. of benzene is placed in a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, and an addition funnel, and 26.0 g. (0.40 mole) of sodium cyanate is added. The suspension is stirred as slowly as possible (ca. 120 r.p.m.;) while 48.0 g. (31.2 ml., 0.42 mole) of trifluoroacetic acid is added dropwise at a rapid rate. The temperature slowly rises to about 37° after three-quarters of the trifluoroacetic acid has been added (ca. 7 minutes). At this point the mixture is cooled to 33–35° by brief immersion in an ice-water bath, then the addition is continued. When the addition of the acid is completed (10–12 minutes total time), the temperature slowly rises to 40° and then gradually subsides. Slow stirring is continued overnight at room temperature.
Twelve milliliters of water for each gram of the crude acid (83–86 ml.) is added to the flask, which is then attached to a reflux condenser and immersed in an oil bath at 150°. After 10–20 minutes of boiling, a clear pale-yellow solution is obtained. This is filtered through a fluted filter into an Erlenmeyer flask. After crystallization has started, 8.3–8.6 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid (1.2 ml. of acid for each gram of crude acid) is added, and the mixture is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature, during which period it is occasionally agitated. Crystallization is completed by keeping the flask in a refrigerator for at least 10 hours. The product is separated by suction filtration and washed with a small amount of ice water. The purified p-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid weighs 4.4–4.7 g. (59–63%) and melts at 216–218° (dec.) and.
B. erythrol-1-(3-Hydroxy-2-methyl-3-phenylpropanoyl)piperidine. A 300-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and charged with nitrogen. One neck is connected with a balloon charged with nitrogen, and the other neck is capped with a rubber septum. Into the flask are placed 50 mL of trifluoroacetic acid and 11.9 g of 1-(2-benzoylpropanoyl)piperidine (48.7 mmol) prepared as described in Part A; then the flask is immersed in an ice–water bath. To the flask is added 7.3 g of dimethylphenylsilane (8.24 mL, 54 mmol) over a 5-min period with the aid of a 10-mL syringe, and the resulting mixture is stirred for 4 hr in the ice bath. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 200 mL of water. After the organic layer is separated, the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The crude oil is placed in a 200-mL, one-necked flask and dissolved in 100 mL of methanolic 1 M sodium hydroxide. The solution is stirred for 1.5 hr at ambient temperature with a magnetic stirrer. The mixture is diluted with 200 mL of dichloromethane and washed with 50 mL of water. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The residual oil is subjected to column chromatography using 100 g of silica gel. After the first fraction (800t mL) of hexane is eluted, the second fraction, eluted with 500 mL of diethyl ether, is collected and concentrated. Recrystallization of the resulting oil from diethyl ether–hexane gives 10.2 g of material, mp 85–86°C. The yield is 90%.
1-Benzyl-5-phenyl-1H-1,2,3-triazole. Benzyl azide (10.0 g, 75 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is placed in a 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask and equipped with an 8 × 30 mm, octagon-shaped Teflon coated-magnetic stirring bar. The center neck is equipped with a three-way stopcock connected to argon line and bubbler. The other two necks are equipped with a rubber septum. The reaction vessel is purged with argon supplied by an argon filled balloon, after which the three-way stopcock is reconnected. 1,2-Dichlorethane (150 mL) and phenylacetylene (8.06 g, 8.66 mL, 79 mmol, 1.05 equiv) are added sequentially to the flask and the stirred solution is placed in a 45 °C oil bath. After five min, a solution of chloro(1,5-cyclooctadiene)(pentamethylcyclopentadiene)-ruthenium (285 mg, 0.75 mmol, 1 mol %) in DCE (3 mL) is added to the reaction vessel via syringe. The orange solution becomes dark brown. After 30 min the solution is cooled to room temperature and silica gel (35 g) is added. The solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 40 mmHg). The resulting light brown powder is placed in a 5 cm diameter column and flushed with ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL). The dark brown solution is concentrated again by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 40 mmHg) to give a dark brown solid. The solid material is transferred to a 250-mL one-necked round-bottomed flask, hexanes (200 mL) are added and the heterogeneous solution is triturated for 15 h. The mixture is filtered using a Büchner funnel, rinsed with hexanes (4 x 25 mL) and dried in vacuo (rt, 18 mmHg) to afford 15.9-16.2 g (90-92%) of the titled compound as a beige powder.
A. N-[(1,1-Dimethylethoxy)carbonyl]-L-serine methyl ester (2) . A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, containing a magnetic stirring bar, is equipped with a dropping funnel, reflux condenser protected from moisture by a calcium chloride-filled drying tube and a rubber septum. The dropping funnel is charged with 23 mL of acetyl chloride. Caution! Acetyl chloride is a reactive substance that must be handled in a fume hood . The flask is charged with 150 mL of methanol and cooled with an ice-water bath under nitrogen. Acetyl chloride is added dropwise over a period of 8 min. The solution is stirred for a further 5 min, then solid 99% (L)-serine, 1, (12.0 g, 114 mmol,) is added in one portion and the solution is slowly heated to reflux. The reflux is continued for 2 hr, then the solution is allowed to cool to room temperature and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give 17.5-17.7 g of crude methyl serinate hydrochloride (98-99% yield) as a white crystalline solid that is used without further purification.
B. N-(2-Methylbutylidene-1-d)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutylamine. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a Teflon paddle stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a nitrogen-inlet tube is flamed dry under a nitrogen atmosphere and allowed to cool. The nitrogen-inlet tube is replaced with a thermometer, and the nitrogen line is attached to a Y-tube placed on the addition funnel. A solution of 27.8 g. (35.1 ml., 0.200 mole) of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl isonitrile in 300 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added to the flask. The flask is cooled to 0° with an ice–salt bath, and 0.2 mole of 2-butyllithium in hexane is transferred to the addition funnel with a syringe. The alkyllithium solution is added to the stirred solution at such a rate that the temperature never exceeds 5°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes as the temperature slowly drops to −5°, and 8 ml. (0.4 mole) of deuterium oxide is injected rapidly into the reaction mixture. The ice bath is removed; the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and filtered through a Büchner funnel into a 1-l., round-bottomed flask. The reaction flask is rinsed with pentane, and the rinse is added to the flask. After evaporation of the solvent, 33.7–34.9 g. (85–88%) of the aldimine is collected by distillation through a 1.5 × 15 cm. Vigreux column, b.p. 52.5–54° (1.5 mm.), nD24.5 1.4321. The IR spectrum (neat) shows strong absorption at 1663 cm.−1, attributable to the isonitrile function.
This material is recrystallized from diethyl ether/pentane (2:1) to give 15.1 g (69%) of 2-iodo-2-cyclohexen-1-one as a pale yellow solid, mp 48.5-49°C. If desired, an additional 2.4 g (11%; mp 48-49°C) can be isolated by concentration of the mother liquor, column chromatography of the residue on 40 g of silica gel eluting with a mixture of 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether , and recrystallization of the collected iodoenone from pentane.
In a tared Erlenmeyer flask surrounded by an ice-salt bath is placed 100 g. (119 cc., 1.78 moles) of acrolein (p. 15). When the temperature has dropped to −10 to −15° a current of dry hydrogen chloride (p. 293) is passed into the acrolein until it shows a gain in weight of 65 g.(1.78 moles). This requires about two hours. The product thus obtained is a clear, viscous, slightly yellow liquid which becomes very turbid and dark colored on standing one or two days.
C. 1,6-Oxido[10]annulene. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 81 g. (1.5 moles) of sodium methoxide and 600 ml. of anhydrous ether. To this slurry is added, with stirring, 117 g. (0.250 mole) of finely powdered 3,4,8,9-tetrabromo-11-oxatricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undecane. The reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for 10 hours and allowed to stand overnight. Following this, 500 ml. of water is added slowly, dissolving the solids. The ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is washed with 250 ml. of water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator affords a brown oil, which when distilled gives 34.4–35.1 g. of yellow 1,6-oxido[10]annulene, b.p. 77° (0.02 mm.). This material readily solidifies at room temperature, and two recrystallizations at −40° from 225 ml. of (5:1) pentane–ether yields 18.3–18.5 g. (51%) of 1,6-oxido[10]annulene as pale yellow needles, m.p. 51–52° and.
B. Ethyl indole-2-carboxylate. Thirty grams (0.109 mole) of the potassium salt is placed in a 400-ml. hydrogenation bottle and dissolved by addition of 200 ml. of glacial acetic acid, producing a yellow, opaque solution. Platinum catalyst3 (0.20 g.) is added, the bottle is placed in a Parr low-pressure hydrogenation apparatus, and the system is flushed several times with hydrogen. With the initial reading on the pressure gauge about 30 p.s.i., the bottle is shaken until hydrogen uptake ceases and then for an additional 1–2 hours. The catalyst is removed by filtration and washed with glacial acetic acid. The filtrate is placed in a 4-l. beaker, and 3 l. of water is added slowly with stirring. Ethyl indole-2-carboxylate precipitates as a yellow solid. It is separated by filtration, washed with five 100-ml. portions of water, and dried over calcium chloride in a desiccator. It weighs 13.2–13.6 g. (64–66%; 47–51% based on o-nitrotoluene); m.p. 118–124°.
B. 5-Hexynal. To a solution of 5.60 g. (0.0500 mole) of 2,3-epoxycyclohexanone in 120 ml. of benzene in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask is added 10.82 g. (0.5152 mole) of trans-1-amino-2,3-diphenylaziridine [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 56 (1988)]. Initially, after brief swirling at room temperature, the reaction mixture is a colorless, homogeneous solution; however it rapidly turns yellow and cloudy due to separation of water. After 2 hours the benzene and water are removed as an azeotrope on a rotary evaporator with the bath maintained at approximately 30°. The resulting crude mixture of diastereomeric hydrazones weighs 15.4 g. and is subjected directly to fragmentation.
A 3-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a thermometer, a separatory funnel, a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a small fractionating column connected with an efficient condenser set for downward distillation. The condenser leads to a receiving vessel cooled in ice water. A solution of 800 g. (4.8 moles) of u.s.p. potassium iodide in 430 cc. of water is placed in the flask, 60 g. of calcium carbonate is added, and the mixture is heated to 60–65°, with stirring.
The flask is allowed to cool, and a solution of 670 g. of 90 per cent potassium hydroxide in 1 l. of water is added. The solution is refluxed and stirred for thirty hours. The flask is fitted with a head for steam distillation, and steam is passed in until foaming prevents further distillation. When the flask has cooled somewhat, the steam inlet is replaced by a separatory funnel with a stem reaching to the bottom of the flask, and 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) or the equivalent amount of more dilute acid is added. The flask is shaken occasionally to prevent stratification of the hydrochloric acid. The dropping funnel is then replaced by the steam inlet, and steam is passed through for about one-half hour. At the end of this time the water layer is siphoned off and discarded.
C. (1S,2S)-2-(N-Tosylamino)-1-[((2S)-2-carbomethoxypyrrolidinyl)carbonyl] cyclohexane (3). Approximately 22.9 g (~90 mmol) of crude amine 2 (prepared above in part B), 13.66 g (135 mmol) of triethylamine, and 100 mL of dry THF are placed in a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a nitrogen inlet. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 18.9 g (99.1 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in 50 mL dry THF. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C with magnetic stirring, and the solution of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride is delivered dropwise over a 30-min period. The resulting cloudy solution is stirred for 60 hr at ambient temperature. After this time period, the reaction mixture is diluted with 50 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and 50 mL of ethyl acetate, transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, mixed thoroughly, and the organic phase separated. The aqueous phase is extracted twice with 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are dried (Na2SO4), filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and the resulting residue purified by chromatography to give 22.43 g (61% from 1) of 3 (Rf 0.34, CHCl3/EtOAc, 1:1) as a colorless solid, mp 144–146°C.
A 500-ml. three-necked flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a two-armed addition tube, one arm of which bears a reflux condenser and the other arm of which is fitted with a thermometer. t-Butyl alcohol (79 g., 1.07 moles) is added to the flask and the thermometer arranged so that its bulb is immersed in the liquid but out of the path of the stirrer. The flask is heated by means of an electric mantle until the temperature of the liquid is 80–85°, and the mantle then is removed. Anhydrous sodium acetate (0.4 g., 4.8 mmoles) is added with stirring, and then 96 g. (1.14 moles) of diketene is added dropwise over a period of 2.5 hours. The temperature of the solution drops to 60–70° during the first 15 minutes and then increases slowly to 110–115°. When all the diketene is added, the reaction subsides and, after the resulting brown-black solution is stirred for an additional 30 minutes, the product is distilled immediately under reduced pressure through a short column. After a small fore-run, the yield of t-butyl acetoacetate, b.p. 85°/20 mm., nD20 1.4200–1.4203, is 127–135 g. (75–80%).
Potassium cyanide (71.6 g., 1.1 moles, U.S.P.) and 100 ml. of 95% ethanol are placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask having a ground joint and arranged with a Hershberg stirrer2. A solution of 113 g. (106 ml., 1 mole) of ethyl cyanoacetate, 79 g. (98 ml., 1.1 moles) of 2-butanone, and 66 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added to the stirred solution over a period of 1 hour. The mixture is stirred for an additional hour, the stirrer is removed, and the mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 7 days.
A. 1,1,2,2-Tetramethoxycyclohexane. A 500-mL, two-necked flask equipped with a stirrer bead, condenser and heating mantle is flushed with dry argon and then charged with 44.8 g of 1,2-cyclohexanedione (0.400 mol), 100 mL of dry methanol (MeOH) and 160 mL of trimethyl orthoformate (1.46 mol). Stirring is begun and approximately 32 drops of concd sulfuric acid are added to the solution. The resultant black solution is heated under argon at reflux for 5 hr. The heating mantle is removed and the solution is cooled to room temperature. Sodium hydrogen carbonate is carefully added to neutralize the solution (approx 4 g required). Methanol, methyl formate and trimethyl orthoformate are removed by distillation at ambient temperature through a straight path distillation apparatus. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure to yield 59.5 g of 1,1,2,2-tetramethoxycyclohexane as a colorless liquid (73%),.
In a 2-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser, are placed 720 g. (230 cc., 4.5 moles) of bromine and 1.5 g. of sulfur. A glass tube is connected to the top of the condenser to carry the evolved hydrogen bromide to a gas trap. Sixty-nine grams (69 cc., 0.52 mole) of dry paraldehyde is added slowly, with stirring, over a period of about four hours. The reaction proceeds under its own heat during the addition of the paraldehyde; subsequently the mixture is heated externally for two hours at 60–80°. The solution is distilled and a fraction collected over the range 155–175°.
2-(3-Ethyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolylmethyl)cyclohexanone (27.6 g., 0.125 mole) is dissolved in 250 ml. of ethanol in a Parr hydrogenation bottle, and 20 g. of freshly prepared W-4 Raney nickel catalyst is added. Hydrogenation is started at an initial hydrogen pressure of 25 p.s.i. Cleavage of the isoxazole ring is complete after 6 hours, after which time the reaction is stopped and the solution is filtered free of catalyst. The catalyst is washed with ether and absolute ethanol, and the combined organic filtrates are concentrated with a rotary evaporator.
The sludge of zinc dust and zinc oxide is filtered from the boiling solution and extracted with 50 cc. of boiling 78 per cent alcohol. The combined filtrates are then poured into 2 l. of water, whereupon a white, flocculent precipitate is obtained. This is filtered with suction and recrystallized from 400 cc. of hot 50 per cent alcohol. The purified 2-aminofluorene crystallizes in needles melting at 127.5°. The yield is 20–21 g. (78–82 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(S)-2-Chloropropanoic acid. In a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-mL dropping funnel, and a two-necked adapter fitted with a thermometer and a reflux condenser, 89.1 g (1 mol) of (S)-alanine is dissolved in 1300 mL of 5 N hydrochloric acid. The mixture is cooled to 0°C in an ice/sodium chloride bath and a precooled solution of 110 g (1.6 mol) of sodium nitrite in 400 mL of water is added dropwise at a rate of about 2 mL/min under vigorous stirring and efficient cooling so that the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 5°C. After 5 hr, the bath is removed and the reaction is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The reflux condenser is connected with a water aspirator and the flask is carefully evacuated with stirring for 3 hr to remove nitrogen oxides, whereupon the color changes from yellowish brown to pale yellow. While the mixture is stirred vigorously, 100 g of solid sodium carbonate is added carefully in small portions so as to prevent excessive foaming. The reaction mixture is extracted with four portions of 400 mL of diethyl ether. The combined ether layers are concentrated to ca. 300 mL using a rotary evaporator at atmospheric pressure. The solution is washed with 50 mL of saturated brine, which thereafter is reextracted with three portions of 100 mL of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried for 10 hr over calcium chloride. The ether is distilled off with a rotary evaporator at atmospheric pressure (bath temperature 40–50°C). The oily residue is transferred into a distillation flask (rinsing the remainder with small portions of ether) and then fractionally distilled at reduced pressure, the main fraction boiling within a range of 2–3°C (i.e., bp 75–77°C at 10 mm) to give 63–71 g (58–65%) of an oil. The colorless oil is sufficiently pure for most purposes and. On prolonged standing in a refrigerator, the oil tends to solidify partially or totally, but the white crystals formed have no sharp melting point. This procedure can be employed for other α-amino acids (see Table I and the Discussion).
In a 5-l. flask, placed on a steam bath and fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, a thermometer well, and a calcium chloride tube, is placed 182 g. (7.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings. To this are added a crystal of iodine and 100 cc. of a solution of 1133 g. (7.5 moles) of 2-bromopentane in 750 g. of n-butyl ether. The stirrer is started, and the flask is heated with steam until the reaction starts. This may take from fifteen minutes to one hour; the flask must be watched quite closely because the reaction, when once started, is very vigorous and evolves a large amount of heat. As soon as the reaction has started, 750 g. of n-butyl ether is added and then the balance of the solution of 2-bromopentane in n-butyl ether is added at such a rate that the temperature is kept at 50–60°. External cooling is used in order to allow more rapid addition of the 2-bromopentane. After addition is complete (about three hours), the mixture is heated on a steam bath for one hour.
B. (E)-1,2-Bis(tributylstannyl)ethylene. In a 200-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and a nitrogen inlet are placed 20.6 g (0.066 mol) of tributylethynylstannane, 23.1 g (0.079 mol) of tributyltin hydride, and 0.25 g (0.0016 mol) of 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile). The mixture is heated at 90°C with stirring for 6 hr. Distillation (170–186°C, 0.3 mm) yields 35.1–36.6 g (88–92%) of (E)-1,2-bis(tributylstannyl)ethylene as a clear, colorless oil and.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 500-ml. dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and an argon inlet tube is charged with 80 g. (0.33 mole) of N,4,4-trimethyl-2-oxazolinium iodide. The system is flushed with argon; 150 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran is added, and the stirred suspension is cooled in an ice bath. Meanwhile, to a cooled solution of freshly prepared 2-methoxyphenylmagnesium bromide (0.414 mole) is added 150 g. (146 ml., 0.828 mole) of dry hexamethylphosphoric triamide. This solution is then transferred under an argon atmosphere to the 500-ml. dropping funnel with the aid of an argon-pressurized siphon. The solution is slowly run into the cooled suspension, whereupon the methiodide salt dissolves. When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature overnight.
(A) Preparation of Ethyl Benzoylacetoacetate.—In a 5-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser, are placed 3.4 l. of dry benzene, 195 g. (1.5 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 235), and 34.5 g. (1.5 gram atoms) of clean sodium. The mixture is heated on a steam cone with stirring and allowed to reflux gently for twenty-four hours. After the suspension of the sodioacetoacetic ester has been cooled slightly, 263 g. (218 cc., 1.9 moles) of benzoyl chloride is added over a period of three hours. The mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional eight hours. It is then cooled to room temperature, and 375 g. of cracked ice is added. After thorough shaking, the benzene layer, which contains the ethyl benzoylacetoacetate, is separated, washed with 75 cc. of 5 per cent sodium bicarbonate solution, dried with sodium sulfate, and the benzene distilled. The residue is distilled in vacuo from a 500-cc. Claisen flask with a 50-cm. fractionating side arm. After a small fore-run of benzoyl chloride, the fraction boiling at 142–148°/6 mm., or 177–181°/20 mm., is collected. The yield is 223–263 g. (63–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A 1-l. round-bottomed flask is charged with 60 g. (1.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide pellets dissolved in 75 ml. of water, 70 g. (0.6 mole) of tert-butylurea, and 225 ml. of commercial ethylene glycol. The flask is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser, and a glass tube is led from the top of the condenser to a small flask immersed in ice water.
A dry, 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, and a dropping funnel is charged with 300 g. (4.41 moles) of sodium formate and 250 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. To this stirred mixture is added 294 g. (266 ml., 3.75 moles) of acetyl chloride as rapidly as possible, while the temperature is maintained at 23–27°. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 5.5 hours at 23–27° to ensure complete reaction. The mixture is then filtered with suction, the solid residue is rinsed with 100 ml. of ether, and the washings are added to the original filtrate. The ether is removed by distillation at reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled, yielding 212 g. (64%) of colorless acetic formic anhydride, b.p. 27–28° (10 mm.), 38–38.5° (39 mm.); nD20 1.388.
After all the stannic chloride has been added, the cooling bath is removed and the mixture stirred for one hour longer. The addition product is hydrolyzed by the slow addition of a mixture of 90 cc. of water and 10 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The yellow benzene layer is separated, washed with 25 cc. of water, and dried over 5–10 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. Benzene and unchanged thiophene are distilled through a short fractionating column (using an oil bath), and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of 2-acetothienone, b.p. 89–91°/9 mm., is 20–21 g. (79–83 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Guaiacol allyl ether. A mixture of 63 g. (0.5 mole) of guaiacol, 66 g. (0.55 mole) of allyl bromide, 70 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate (0.5 mole), and 100 ml. of dry acetone in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask is refluxed on a steam bath for 8 hours and cooled. The mixture is diluted with 200 ml. of water and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined extracts are washed with two 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide and dried with 50 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. After removal of the solvent, the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of guaiacol allyl ether boiling at 110–113°/12 mm. is 66–75 g. (80–90%).
D. 4-Benzyl-10,19-diethyl-4,10,19-triaza-1,7,13,16-tetraoxacycloheneicosane (triaza-21-crown-7). A mixture of 10 g (0.03 mol) of 9-benzyl-3,9,15-triaza-6,12-dioxaheptadecane and 600 mL of acetonitrile is placed in an oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser, an efficient mechanical stirrer and a rubber septum. Argon gas is flushed through the flask using a needle through the septum before and during the reaction. To the above mixture, while stirring at room temperature, is added 50 g (0.36 mol) of anhydrous powdered potassium carbonate and the mixture is stirred for 15 min; then 11.5 g (0.031 mmol) of 1,2-bis(2-iodoethoxy)ethane is added. The resulting mixture is stirred under reflux for 24 hr. The cooled mixture is filtered under vacuum and the solid is washed with 100 mL of acetonitrile. The solvent is removed from the filtrate on a rotary evaporator. Methylene chloride (160 mL) is added to the residue and the resulting mixture is stirred. The mixture is filtered under vacuum and the solid is washed with two 20-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic layers are evaporated on a rotary evaporator to give a brown oil. The oil is purified by chromatography on 300 g of alumina using 1000 mL of toluene/ethanol: 50:1 as the eluant. The first 120–150 mL of eluant is removed. The remainder of the eluant is evaporated in a rotary evaporator to give 9.6–10 g (72–75%) of the triaza-21-crown-7 as a light yellow oil,(Note 23),(Note 24).
A 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and gas inlet tube is charged with 476 g. (3.45 moles) of furylacrylic acid2 and 1580 g. (about 33 moles) of 95% ethanol. The mixture is heated to boiling, and anhydrous hydrogen chloride is introduced at such a rate that the mixture becomes saturated after 90 minutes. The gas inlet tube is replaced by a stopper, and a 2-ft. Vigreux column is substituted for the reflux condenser. About 250 ml. of solvent is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure; then another 300 ml. is removed while the pressure is slowly reduced (water aspirator). The residue is cooled and stirred with a solution of about 260 g. of sodium carbonate in water. The mixture is extracted with two 250-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined extracts are washed with 100 ml. of water. Distillation of the organic portion through a 2-ft. Vigreux column yields, after a small fore-run, 579–657 g. (73–83%) of diethyl γ-oxopimelate, b.p. 116–121° /0.3 mm., nD25 1.4395–1.4400.
B. (S)-1-Methyl-2-[(dihydroisoindol-2-yl)methyl]pyrrolidine (3). A dry, 200-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, a septum cap, and an argon inlet is charged with lithium aluminum hydride (LAH, 0.96 g, 25.3 mmol) in THF (10 mL). After cooling to 0 °C with the aid of an ice-water bath, a solution of (S)-N-(N-tert-butoxycarbonylprolyl)dihydroisoindole (3.96 g, 12.5 mmol) in THF (15 mL) was added under an argon atmosphere. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is refluxed for 3 h. After cooling the mixture to 0 °C, the reaction is quenched carefully by the slow addition of saturated aqueous sodium sulfate (approx 5 mL). The liquid is decanted away from the precipitate, and the precipitate was washed with THF (2 × 20 mL). The combined liquid is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel (CH2Cl2/MeOH/Et3N:95/5/1), to afford (S)-1-methyl-2- [(dihydroisoindol-2-yl)methyl]pyrrolidine (3) (1.56 g, 58%).
A solution of 30 g. (0.3 mole) of redistilled methyl isobutyl ketone in 50 ml. of absolute ether is added to the stirred suspension of sodium amide during 5–10 minutes. After an additional 5 minutes, a solution of 78 g. (0.6 mole) of redistilled ethyl isovalerate in 50 ml. of dry ether is added during about 15 minutes. Stirring is continued for 2 hours while the mixture is heated under reflux on the steam bath. The gelatinous suspension of the sodium salt of diisovalerylmethane is poured into 300 ml. of water, made neutral to litmus by dilute hydrochloric acid, and extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The solvent is removed by distillation under reduced pressure, and the residue is dissolved in an equal volume of methanol. A solution prepared from 44 g. of cupric acetate monohydrate and 350 ml. of water is heated nearly to the boiling point, filtered, and added to the methanol solution. The resulting mixture is allowed to stand until it has cooled to room temperature. The blue copper salt of diisovalerylmethane is collected on a Büchner funnel, pressed as dry as possible, washed on the funnel with 100 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°), and again sucked dry. The yield of the copper salt after air drying is 44–51 g. (69–79%); it melts in the range 150–155°.
The crude product is dissolved in a minimum amount of dichloromethane and adsorbed onto 25 g of silica gel (32–63 micron) by subsequent evaporation of the dichloromethane under reduced pressure. The sample of dry, dark brown silica gel is added to the top of a column containing 500 g of silica gel (32–63 micron) with a mobile phase of hexanes. The polarity of the mobile phase is gradually increased from hexanes to 95:5 hexanes-ethyl acetate. The fractions containing the desired product (Rf = 0.26, 95:5 hexanes-ethyl acetate) are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 6.9 g of 3 as a yellow solid. Additional purification is required to remove traces of tin by-products. Compound 3 is dissolved in 70 mL of ethyl acetate and stirred over 70 mL of saturated, aqueous potassium fluoride for 24 hr. The two phases are separated and the organic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting yellow solid is recrystallized from ethyl alcohol to provide 6.1 g (48%, 2 crops) of 3 as yellow needles,, and.
The yield is 260–300 g. of material containing a small amount of mineral salts but otherwise nearly pure. It can be purified further by recrystallization from 2.5 to 3.5 l. of hot water, 150–180 g. of material, which melts at 230–232° (corr.), being obtained. The yield of recrystallized material is 50–60 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the nicotine employed.
To the phosphate in a 250-mL flask on a water bath at 25°C is added 20 mL of 98–100% formic acid, and the resulting mixture is stirred until bubbling has ceased (30–40 min). Benzene (50 mL) is added and most of the excess formic acid is removed on an evaporator. To the residue are added 50 mL of ethyl acetate and 30 mL of a sodium chloride–sodium carbonate solution. The organic phase is washed twice with the latter solution (i.e., a total of 3 × 20 mL), the combined inorganic phases are extracted once with 50 mL of ethyl acetate, the combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed, and the product is distilled to give 3.2 g (64%) of 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone, bp 97–101°C (19 mm).
C. (1S,2R)-1-Aminoindan-2-ol (100% ee). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stir bar, a 125-mL addition funnel, a pH probe, and a thermocouple is charged with the hydrolysis solution from Part B and 1-butanol (100 mL). Sodium hydroxide (80 mL of an aqueous 50% solution,) is added slowly with external ice bath cooling to maintain the temperature below 30°C until the reaction mixture reaches a pH of 12-13. The upper 1-butanol layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with another 100 mL of 1-butanol . The combined butanol extracts are diluted with methanol (200 mL), and vacuum-filtered through a Büchner funnel into a 2000-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical overhead stirrer, 250-mL addition funnel, and reflux condenser. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously and heated to reflux, and a solution of L-tartaric acid (35.5 g, 0.24 mol, 1.2 equiv) in methanol (200 mL) is added over 15-30 min while reflux is maintained. Heating is discontinued until a thick but stirrable slurry is formed. The suspension is reheated to reflux for 2 hr. At this point, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and allowed to stand for 1 hr. The resulting solids are collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with methanol (2 × 100 mL). The white solid thus obtained is then dried under reduced pressure to yield 47.4 g of the 1:1 tartrate salt.
A 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a 25-cm. Vigreux column attached to a trap cooled in an acetone–dry ice mixture is charged with 100 ml. of diethyl phthalate and 43 g. (0.30 mole) of tetracyanoethylene oxide. The dropping funnel is charged with 44 g. (0.30 mole) of distilled n-butyl sulfide, the pressure is reduced to 5–20 mm. with a water aspirator, and the reaction flask is warmed with a 50° water bath. The n-butyl sulfide is added dropwise with stirring over 20–25 minutes, and the internal temperature is maintained at 50 ± 2° by controlling the temperature of the water bath. The reaction is exothermic at the start, but it is necessary to supply heat toward the end of the addition. The internal temperature is increased to 80° over 10–15 minutes after the sulfide has been added. The vacuum on the system is released by the introduction of nitrogen. The solid carbonyl cyanide that has collected in the trap is allowed to warm to room temperature under nitrogen, and 2 g. of tetracyanoethylene oxide and a boiling stone are added. The mixture is then warmed to 50°, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure (5–20 mm.) into a second trap cooled in an acetone–dry ice mixture. Another portion of tetracyanoethylene oxide (1 g.) is added to the distillate, and the carbonyl cyanide is distilled, again under reduced pressure (5–20 mm.), into a distillation flask cooled in acetone–dry ice mixture. Fractionation of the distillate through a 20-cm. column packed with glass helices gives 20.8–21.8 g. (86–91%) of faintly yellow carbonyl cyanide, b.p. 65–66°,, and.
To a cold solution of 160 g. (4 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask provided with a mechanical stirrer is added slowly 250 g. (3.5 moles) of ethylene cyanohydrin (p. 256), the temperature being kept below 30° by means of a cold water bath. The mixture is allowed to stand overnight in the bath, when the flask is fitted with a two-holed rubber stopper bearing a capillary tube reaching almost to the bottom and a delivery tube bent slightly downward for attachment to a suction pump. The flask is then heated slowly to 80° during four hours by raising the temperature of the surrounding water. A rapid current of air is drawn through the mixture during the heating. The mixture is now evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure by heating in an oil bath, the temperature of which is raised as rapidly as the boiling of the material will permit. The oil bath is finally held at 125° until the product becomes pasty. The flask is allowed to cool, and 50 cc. of water is poured down one side of the flask, and the solid material at that point worked carefully into a paste with a stout stirring rod.
After the product has been air-dried for about four days, the yield is about 665 g.; it melts at 97°. A sample of this partially dried product, on drying in a vacuum desiccator over sulfuric acid for twenty hours, loses about 10 per cent of its weight, and the melting point is 106°. By longer drying under ordinary conditions, the melting point of 106° is reached. The total yield of dry product is about 595 g. (99 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. (±)-Binaphthylphosphoric (BNP) acid. A 1-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a reflux condenser topped by a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer, is charged with 450 mL of pyridine and, while stirring, with 100 g (0.35 mol) of (±)-1,1'-bi-2-naphthol.
C. 1,4-Di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar under argon is placed fresh sodium hydride (33.6 g of a 55% dispersion in oil; 18.5 g, 0.77 mol). The oil is removed by washing with hexanes (3 × 100 mL) and. The flask is fitted with a 500-mL pressure-equalized addition funnel, a reflux condenser, and a stopper. Tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) is added under argon. A solution of 2,3-di-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol (55 g, 0.34 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) is then added dropwise with stirring at room temperature. Benzyl bromide (91 mL, 130.8 g, 0.76 mol) is then added dropwise via the addition funnel. After stirring for 12 hr at room temperature, the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 hr, cooled in an ice bath, and quenched by addition of water until a clear solution results. Tetrahydrofuran is removed under reduced pressure (water aspirator); the residue is diluted with water (500 mL) and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 500 mL). The extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. Removal of volatile material under reduced pressure (water aspirator) gives crude 1,4-di-O-benzyl-2,3-O-isopropylidene-L-threitol as an oil (115–116 g).
A. 5,9-Dithiaspiro[3.5]nonane. A dry, 2-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 1.25 l. of dry tetrahydrofuran and 50 g. (0.42 mole) of 1,3-dithiane are added. The flask is quickly equipped with a three-way stopcock bearing a standard tapered joint, a rubber septum, and a nitrogen inlet, as shown in Figure 1. The solution is stirred with an efficient magnetic stirrer and cooled to an external temperature of −20° with a methanol–dry ice bath. A 3% excess (total of 0.43 mole) of 1.5–2.5 M n-butyllithium in n-hexane is added through the rubber septum with a syringe. The bath temperature is kept between −10° and −20° for 2 hours before the temperature of the bath is reduced to −75° and 65.5 g. (44.5 ml., 0.417 mole) of 1-bromo-3-chloropropane is added with a syringe over 10 minutes. The temperature of the bath is raised to −30° over a 2-hour period by gradually replacing the cold methanol with warm methanol. The bath is removed and stirring is continued until the reaction flask is at room temperature. The flask is again cooled to −75° and 0.44 mole of n-butyllithium in n-hexane is added with a syringe over 10 minutes. After the addition is complete, the temperature of the reaction flask is allowed to rise to room temperature overnight. The solvent is removed from the product with a rotary evaporator at 50° and aspirator pressure. Water (300 ml.) and diethyl ether (500 ml.) are added to the product in the flask, the ether layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is washed again with 500 ml. of ether. The organic layers are combined, washed with 200 ml. of water, and dried over 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation to yield about 75 g. of crude product. Distillation through a packed column gives 44–57 g. (65–84%) of 5,9-dithiaspiro[3.5]nonane, b.p. 65–75° (1 mm.), n20D 1.5700. This product is of sufficient purity for use in Part B.
The solution is transferred to a 3-l. flask, using about 50 cc. of water for rinsing, and to it is added, with violent shaking, twice its volume (1400–1500 cc.) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. The solution is decanted from the gummy residue and the latter extracted three times with methyl alcohol under reflux, each time with 500 cc. of the solvent. In order to remove all the arabinose from the salts the precipitate is dissolved in 200–220 cc. of water, transferred to an evaporating dish, and 400 cc. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is stirred in with a heavy rod. The clear alcohol solution is decanted and the solid triturated twice with 300-cc. portions of methyl alcohol. All the alcoholic extracts (both ethyl and methyl) are combined, shaken thoroughly, and 95 per cent ethyl alcohol added as long as any appreciable precipitate forms. The solution is allowed to stand for some hours until it is clear, decanted, and concentrated under reduced pressure on a boiling-water bath to a thin sirup. Crystallization usually begins as soon as the sirup is cool, though it is sometimes necessary to seed with arabinose.
For purification, this material is dissolved in 3–3.5 l. of hot ligroin, boiled with 10–15 g. of decolorizing carbon, and filtered with suction. After cooling in an ice bath the crystals are collected on a Büchner funnel, pressed, and washed with two 25-cc. portions of cold ligroin. The pale yellow product melts at 97.5–99° and weighs 250–280 g. (53–59 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
In a 2-l. Claisen flask are mixed 1 kg. (3.90 moles) of 9-bromophenanthrene (p. 134) and 400 g. (4.46 moles) of cuprous cyanide. A small motor-driven spiral stirrer is inserted, and the flask is heated at 260° for 6 hours. The flask is then provided with a fine capillary inlet tube, a thermometer, and a 2-l. distilling flask attached to the side arm of the Claisen flask as receiver. The 9-cyanophenanthrene is distilled at 190–195°/2 mm. The yield of crude product is 740 g. (93%), m.p. 94–98°. One recrystallization from about 2 l. of dry ethanol yields 690 g. (87%) of material melting at 105–107°,, and.
The residual liquid in the flask is allowed to cool, and a cold solution of 320 g. (3.3 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 450 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel. This should be done slowly and with stirring in order to prevent foaming. The solution becomes hot and may reflux spontaneously. After all the sulfuric acid has been added the solution is refluxed for about three hours. A layer of organic acid appears and the reflux condenser is replaced by an automatic separator. The solution is distilled with the separator attached, and the aqueous portion is returned to the distilling flask. This operation is continued until practically all the organic acid has been driven over; from ten to fifteen hours is required. At the end, about 100 cc. of water is collected in the separator and extracted with ether in order to remove the dissolved acid. The ether is distilled; the crude acid is mixed with an equal volume of dry benzene and distilled from a modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. Benzene and water distil first and then 3-methylpentanoic acid distils at 193–196°/743 mm. The yield is 66–69 g. (62–65 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The catalyst is filtered, 200 g. (155 ml.) of 25% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added to the filtrate, and the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. The condenser is replaced by a short Vigreux column and distillation head, and the heating is continued until most of the methanol has distilled. The two-phase residue is cooled and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column to yield 68–77 g. (44–50%) of cyclodecanone, b.p. 94–98° (10 mm.), m.p. 20–22°.
A. Benzyl (S)-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-3-phenylpropanoate. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, is charged with a solution of 16.6 g (120 mmol) of potassium carbonate and 4.8 g (120 mmol) of sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of water. Following the addition of 9.9 g (60 mmol) of S-phenylalanine, the stirred suspension is heated at reflux to form a clear solution. To this refluxing solution is added dropwise 31.0 g (181 mmol) of distilled benzyl bromide . The mixture is heated at reflux for an additional 1 hr and then cooled to room temperature. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 75 mL of diethyl ether . The combined organic phases are washed with about 75 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl) and dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4). Following the removal of the solvent under reduced pressure, the crude product is purified using flash chromatography ( 250 g of 230-400 mesh silica gel ; hexane/ethyl acetate 10:1, v/v) to provide 15.14-18.0 g (58-69%) of benzyl (S)-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-3-phenylpropanoate.
After the butyl nitrite has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred for about ten minutes longer in order to insure completion of the reaction, after which the cupferron is filtered off and washed several times with small portions of fresh ether. The product is spread on sheets of paper until all traces of ether have been lost, and is then stored in bottles where it is exposed to the vapors of ammonium carbonate. This may be done by protecting each cork with a double sheet of filter paper and placing a lump of ammonium carbonate between the cork and the filter paper.
C. N-Methyl-2-chloropyridinium trifluoromethane sulfonate ( 3). A 1000-mL round-bottomed flask, equipped with an egg-shapped magnetic stir bar (0.625 × 1.5 in) and a rubber septum, is flame dried under a stream of nitrogen and cooled to ambient temperature. Following the addition of CH2Cl2 (250 mL) and 2-chloropyridine (13.1 mL, 139 mmol, 1.0 equiv), the flask is cooled in a dry ice/acetone bath (-78 °C, bath temperature) under nitrogen. Methyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (25.0 g, 153 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is then added slowly via syringe over 10 min through the septum down the side of the flask to allow cooling prior to mixing with the bulk solvent. The cold bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly to ambient temperature (23 °C) and stirred an additional 12 h, leading to a white precipitate. The reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 mmHg, 30 °C) to deliver a white solid. Toluene (120 mL) is added to further induce precipitation, and after swirling under nitrogen for ~10 minutes, the toluene/CH2Cl2 mixture is removed from the solids via cannula under N2 pressure. The white solid is dried under reduced pressure at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h at 23 °C to afford 35.9 g (93%) of N-methyl-2-chloropyridinium trifluoromethane sulfonate (3) as a white solid (mp 147-148 °C).
A white product is obtained by vacuum distillation followed by crystallization of the crude product. Twenty-five grams of the crude substance on distillation gives 20 to 24 g. of distillate boiling at 200–205°/20 mm., and when this is crystallized from a mixture of 75 ml. of acetic acid and 150 ml. of water it gives 17.5 to 22.5 g. of 6-bromo-2-naphthol which melts at 127–129°.
The mixture is filtered hot, and the insoluble residue is washed with distilled water. The total filtrate is now partially neutralized with 300 cc. of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, while the mixture is well stirred and cooled, and then a saturated solution of 3750 g. of crystallized sodium acetate is added. The Congo red test for mineral acid should then be entirely negative. Care must be taken not to make the solution alkaline with sodium hydroxide. After standing for three days at room temperature, the precipitated cystine is filtered on a suction funnel. This crude material, containing, in addition to the cystine, some "humin" pigments and tyrosine, is dissolved in 3 l. of 3 per cent hydrochloric acid. The solution is filtered and completely decolorized by two to five treatments with 20–25 g. portions of decolorizing carbon (Norite) which has been completely freed from calcium phosphate by boiling with dilute hydrochloric acid and washing with cold water. The filtrate after decolorizing should be water-clear, or at the most only slightly yellow. If it shows more color, the treatment with decolorizing carbon should be carried out again. The solution should finally be filtered once by gravity to remove traces of a solid impurity which is apt to pass through the suction funnel.
The clear, pale yellow solution is poured slowly with vigorous stirring onto 4.5 kg. of cracked ice; the temperature of this mixture must not rise above 20°. The crude nitration product is filtered through cloth on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel, using suction, and the mass is pressed as dry as possible. The cake is removed and stirred vigorously with 2 l. of ice water. The solid is filtered; the cake is removed and stirred again with 2 l. of ice water. This washing is repeated four times. The crude product, after drying in the air, melts at 185–190° and weighs 165–174 g. (63–66 per cent of the theoretical amount). This material is purified by crystallization from 3 to 3.2 l. of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol. This furnishes 136–140 g. (52–53 per cent of the theoretical amount) of 4-nitrophthalimide melting at 198°.
B. Homophthalic anhydride. A mixture of 60 g. (0.33 mole) of dry homophthalic acid and 33.7 g. (31 ml., 0.33 mole) of acetic anhydride in a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted to a reflux condenser by a ground-glass joint is refluxed for 2 hours. The mixture is cooled to about 10° for 30 minutes, and the solid anhydride is collected on a Büchner funnel with the aid of suction. It is washed with 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid and pressed, and as much of the solvent as possible is removed by suction. The product is spread out on a porous plate for several hours; it amounts to 46–47.5 g (85–88%) of white crystals melting at 140–141°.
The reaction mixture is cooled to 100°, and 40 ml. of water is added cautiously in small portions with continued stirring. As the water is added the mixture sets to a gel, and then, upon the addition of the remainder of the water and gentle tapping of the reaction flask, the stiff mass breaks up and boiling begins. Refluxing is continued by heating the oil bath for another 15 minutes to ensure the complete hydrolysis of the aluminum tert-butoxide.
While still hot, the solution is filtered with suction in order to remove the zinc oxide, which is washed with 1 l. of hot water. The filtrate is placed in an enameled pan, saturated with salt, about 3 kg. being required, and cooled to 0° by being placed in an ice-salt mixture. The phenylhydroxylamine, which crystallizes out in long, light yellow needles, is filtered by suction. The yield of crude product varies considerably, depending upon the amount of salt solution present, but averages 350–400 g. This corresponds to 275–300 g. (62–68 per cent of the theoretical amount) of actual phenylhydroxylamine, as determined by its separation from inorganic materials by solution in ether.
To a solution of 26.6 g. (0.66 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 240 cc. of water is added 80 g. (0.416 mole) of 4-nitrophthalimide (p. 459). The mixture is heated rapidly to boiling and boiled gently for ten minutes. The solution is made barely acid to litmus with concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42); after the neutral point is reached, an additional 70 cc. (100 g., 1.1 moles) of nitric acid is added. The solution is again boiled for three minutes, then cooled below room temperature, transferred to a 1-l. separatory funnel, and extracted with two 300-cc. portions of alcohol-free ether. Care is taken to ensure thorough mixing before separation of the layers. After the extract is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the ether is distilled until solid begins to separate. The concentrated ether solution is poured into a porcelain dish and the residual solvent allowed to evaporate in a hood. The practically white crystals of 4-nitrophthalic acid which separate melt at 163–164° and have a neutralization equivalent of 105.5 (theoretical, 105.5). The yield is 85–87 g. (96–99 per cent of the theoretical quantity).
A. 2-(2-Bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanenitrile (1). An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask containing 2-bromophenylacetonitrile (8.0 g, 40.8 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is equipped with an oval magnetic stirring bar (32 mm x 15 mm), argon inlet, and a rubber septum. An argon atmosphere is maintained throughout the reaction using an argon manifold system. The flask is charged through the septum via syringe with anhydrous THF (150 mL) and NaHMDS (122.4 mL, 122.4 mmol, 3.0 equiv) is added dropwise over a 4 min period, which results in the solution becoming brown. After stirring for 20 min, the flask is immersed in a room temperature water bath and 1-iodopropane (8.8 mL, 89.8 mmol, 2.2 equiv) is added dropwise over a 3 min period, resulting in a pale brown slurry. The reaction is followed by TLC analysis. After stirring for 2.5 h, the septum is removed and saturated NH4Cl solution (100 mL) is added. The organic layer is separated using a 500-mL separatory funnel and the aqueous solution is extracted with diethyl ether (3 x 20 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over MgSO4 (10 g), filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (from 760 mmHg to 26 mmHg, 40 °C). The residue is transferred to a 500-mL round-bottomed flask and dried for 4 h under vacuum (10 mmHg). The crude compound 1 thus obtained is used directly in the next step without further purification.
N-Boc-3-pyrroline.3 An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, rubber septum with nitrogen inlet, and condenser with a bubbler-sealed outlet, is charged with 732 mg (0.89 mmol, 0.5 mol%) of bis(tricyclohexylphosphine)benzylidine ruthenium dichloride and 445 mL of dry dichloromethane. The mixture is stirred under a nitrogen atmosphere to give a burgundy-colored solution. N-Boc-diallylamine (38.3 mL, 178 mmol) is transferred to the flask by syringe. After addition of the N-Boc-diallylamine, ethylene gas is evolved vigorously and the color of the solution changes from burgundy to dark brown. The solution is heated to reflux with stirring for 2.5 hr, then cooled to room temperature.
Benzylidenearginine, Method 1.—To 500 g. of gelatine is added 1.5 l. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19); the mixture is warmed on the steam bath for thirty minutes and boiled over a free flame for eight to ten hours under a reflux condenser provided with a trap for hydrogen chloride gas. The solution is concentrated to 400 cc. on the steam bath under reduced pressure, employing the apparatus shown in Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 427. The syrupy residue is then diluted with 500 cc. of distilled water and again concentrated to 400 cc. This process of dilution and evaporation is repeated twice more. The final residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of hot distilled water and decolorized by adding 15 g. of decolorizing carbon and heating for ten minutes on the steam bath. The filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath and treated with 250–350 cc. of a 40 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide until slightly alkaline to litmus, keeping the temperature below 10°. An additional 70-cc. portion of 40 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is added, keeping the temperature below 5°; this is followed by the addition, in four portions, of 225 cc. of benzaldehyde, with vigorous shaking after each addition, the temperature being held below 5° throughout. The addition of the benzaldehyde occupies about ten minutes.
A. 2-Tetradecyl-sym-trithiane. A 1-l., round-bottomed, side-armed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 25.0 g. (0.180 mole) of finely ground, pure, sym-trithiane. The flask is equipped with a three-way stopcock and a rubber septum on the side arm. The air in the flask is replaced with dry nitrogen. Tetrahydrofuran (350 ml.) is added by syringe, and the resulting slurry is stirred vigorously in a cooling bath at −30°. After the addition of 0.190 mole of n-butyllithium (1.5–2.5 molar in n-hexane), the mixture is stirred for 1.5–2.5 hours, keeping the bath temperature between −25° and −15°. After this period of time the trithiane is dissolved, and dry ice is added (no excess!) to the bath until the temperature is about −70°. To this cooled solution is rapidly added 50.0 g. (49.5 ml., 0.180 mole) of 1-bromotetradecane (myristyl bromide) by syringe, and the resulting mixture is stirred overnight, during which time the bath temperature rises to 0–25° and a heavy, colorless precipitate separates. Stirring is continued for 1 hour at room temperature before the mixture is poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel containing 800 ml. of water and 500 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. After shaking, the layers are separated and the aqueous layer is shaken with two additional 500-ml. portions of carbon tetrachloride. Some undissolved trithiane is filtered from the combined organic layers, which are washed with water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The solvent is removed by evaporation, yielding 54–59 g. of crude, solid 2-tetradecyl-sym-trithiane, after drying under reduced pressure.
A. Dimethyl-2-propynylsulfonium bromide. A mixture of 6.2 g. (0.10 mole) of dimethyl sulfide, 11.9 g. (0.100 mole) of 3-bromopropyne, and 10 ml. of acetonitrile is stirred magnetically for 20 hours in a darkened, 100-ml., round-bottomed flask fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube. The resulting white, crystalline mass is filtered with suction and washed with three 50-ml. portions of dry diethyl ether, giving 16.4 g. (90%) of the sulfonium salt, m.p. 105–106°. This material may be used in the next step without purification but, if desired, it may be recrystallized from ethanol-ether with minimal loss, m.p. 109–110°.
B. N-(α-Tosylbenzyl)formamide (2). A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with an overhead stirrer, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen (N2) inlet and a temperature probe is charged with 55 mL of acetonitrile and 55 mL of toluene, 10.7 mL (105.6 mmol) of benzaldehyde, 10.5 mL (264 mmol) of formamide and 14.7 mL (116 mmol) of chlorotrimethylsilane. After heating the solution at 50°C for 4-5 hr, 24.7 g (158.3 mmol) of p-toluenesulfinic acid (1) is added and heating is continued for an additional 4-5 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and 55 mL of TBME is added. The solution is stirred for 5 min and 275 mL of water is added. The resulting mixture is cooled to 0°C, held there for 1 hr and the precipitated white solid is collected using a Büchner funnel. The reaction flask is washed with 35 mL of TBME and this rinse is poured over the filter cake. After washing with TBME a second time, the solid is dried in a vacuum oven at 60°C for 5-10 hr to give 26.6-29.1 g (85-94%) of N-(α-tosylbenzyl)formamide (2) which is used in the next step without further purification.
B. (−)-(S)-2-(Benzyloxy)propanal . A flame-dried, 500-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel sealed with a rubber septum, and an argon balloon is loaded under an atmosphere of argon with 18.7 g (90 mmol) of (−)-(S)-ethyl 2-(benzyloxy)propanoate and the compound is dissolved in anhydrous diethyl ether (180 mL). The reaction mixture is cooled to −78°C by means of a cooling bath (dry ice/ethanol). A 1 M solution of diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAH) in hexane (126 mL, 126 mmol) is added very slowly dropwise to the solution of the ester and stirring is continued for at least 1 hr after the complete addition of the DIBAH solution. Upon complete consumption of the ester, the crude reaction mixture is poured directly with vigorous stirring into 360 mL of ice cold 4 N hydrochloric acid. The aqueous phase is extracted with diethyl ether (4 × 180 mL) and the combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of aqueous saturated NaCl solution. After drying over MgSO4, filtration and removal of the solvents under reduced pressure by means of a rotary evaporator, 14.4 g (98%) of the crude aldehyde is obtained.
Ten grams (0.056 mole) of 2a-thiohomophthalimide2 and a solution of 30 g. of potassium hydroxide in 125 ml. of water are placed in a 300-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask. The mixture is refluxed for 48 hours, filtered, and acidified with 12N hydrochloric acid. The solid that forms on cooling is collected by filtration and recrystallized from a mixture of 25 ml. of water and as much acetic acid (about 7 ml.) as necessary to dissolve the solid in the boiling solution, with addition of a little activated carbon. The yield of homophthalic acid, m.p. 181°, is 6.1–7.5 g. (60–73%).
The white, finely divided precipitate of nitrourea is filtered upon a 12-cm. Büchner funnel. A hardened filter paper is used in this operation, and the nitrourea is pressed as dry as possible. The product is washed in the funnel with four portions of cold water just sufficient to cover it, and pressed dry each time. Then it is dried in the air. By strongly cooling the filtrates, a further small amount of nitrourea may be obtained and added to the main portion. The yield of air-dried material is 120–150 g. (70–87 per cent of the theoretical amount). It melts with decomposition at 150–164° and is sufficiently pure for use in the preparation of semicarbazide and.
In a 1-l. flask are placed 50 g. (0.38 mole) of benzoyl cyanide (p. 112) and 500 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The mixture is shaken occasionally until the solid is dissolved completely and is then allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 days. At the end of this time the clear yellow solution is poured into 2 l. of water and extracted with one 400-ml. portion and three 250-ml. portions of ether. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residual oil is placed in a vacuum desiccator containing phosphorus pentoxide and solid sodium hydroxide and allowed to remain there until dry. The yield of crude solid acid melting from 57° to 64° is about 55–56 g. (96–98%). The crude acid is dissolved in 750 ml. of hot carbon tetrachloride, and 2 g. of Norit is added. The solution is filtered and allowed to cool to room temperature and then cooled in an ice-water mixture until crystallization is complete. The solid acid is filtered with suction, and the solvent remaining on the crystals is removed by placing the product in a vacuum desiccator for about 2 days. The yield of slightly yellow benzoylformic acid melting at 64–66° is 42–44 g. (73–77%).
The crude nitroso compound is added gradually, with continuous shaking, to a solution of 407 g. (1.8 moles) of stannous chloride dihydrate in 420 cc. (4.8 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) contained in a 3-l. flask. The reaction is exothermic, and cooling is applied, if necessary, to keep the temperature below 60°. After standing for at least an hour, the mixture is made strongly alkaline by the cautious addition of a cold solution of 520 g. (13 moles) of sodium hydroxide in about 800 cc. of water. During the addition of the alkali the mixture is agitated vigorously and cooled in running water.
A 100-ml., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 2.34 g. (0.0200 mole) of indole and 15 ml. of hexamethylphosphoric triamide under a static atmosphere of argon. The flask is cooled to 0° with an ice bath, and 0.53 g. (0.022 mole) of sodium hydride is added to the stirred solution over a period of 10 minutes. The resulting slurry is stirred for 5 hours at room temperature then cooled to 0° (ice bath) before 2.53 g. (2.30 ml., 0.0200 mole) of benzyl chloride is added as rapidly as possible to the stirred mixture. The mixture is stirred for 8–15 hours (overnight), during which time the ice in the ice bath melts, and the temperature of the reaction flask gradually rises to room temperature. The mixture is then diluted with 15 ml. of water and extracted with three 25-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined ethereal extracts are washed with two 40-ml. portions of water and dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration the solvent is removed at reduced pressure, and 4.4 g. of crude 1-benzylindole is obtained as a liquid. After bulb-to-bulb distillation of this material in a Kügelrohr oven [120–130° (0.0025 mm.)], crystallization of the distillate from 15 ml. of hot ethanol affords 3.46–3.61 g. (83–87%) of 1-benzylindole. A second crop of 0.17–0.26 g. (4–6%) is obtained on concentration of the mother liquors to 6 ml. The total yield of 1-benzylindole, m.p. 43–44°, is 3.72–3.78 g. (90–91%) and.
One-half of the crude product is dissolved in five times its weight of hot methanol, and the solution is boiled with 3 g. of Norit or decolorizing carbon. The solution is filtered while hot and cooled in an ice bath. The precipitate is collected on a filter and washed with 25 ml. of cold methanol. The mother liquors are used to recrystallize the remaining crude material. The yield of bright yellow coumalic acid, melting at 206–209°, is 68–73 g. (65–70%).
C. (2R,4R)-1,2:4,5-Diepoxypentane . A 1-L, round-bottomed flask with a magnetic stirrer bar is charged with (2R,4R)-1,5-dichloro-2,4-pentanediol (6.00 g, 34.7 mmol) and diethyl ether (270 mL), and the solution is cooled to 0°C. Freshly powdered potassium hydroxide (KOH, 18.5 g, 330 mmol) is added and the solution is stirred for 3 hr at 25°C. The reaction mixture is filtered through a plug of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), and the ether is removed under reduced pressure from an ice bath to give 3.20 g (92%) of the product as a colorless oil. The optical purity of the product is >97% ee.
B. N,N,N-Trimethylcyclooctylammonium hydroxide. To a 1-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer are added 100 g. (0.34 mole) of N,N,N-trimethylcyclooctylammonium iodide, 76 g. of silver oxide, and 350 ml. of distilled water. The suspension is stirred at room temperature for 5 hours and is filtered through a Buchner funnel. The filter cake is washed with four 35-ml. portions of distilled water. The light yellow filtrate is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask and the volume is reduced to approximately 90 ml. employing a rotary evaporator and a 40° water bath. The viscous N,N,N-trimethylcyclooctylammonium hydroxide solution is transferred to a 200-ml. dropping funnel, with a pressure-equalizing side arm, for use in the next step in the synthesis.
The fraction which boils at 120–130° under atmospheric pressure is redistilled, yielding further quantities of acetic acid (below 120°) and acetic anhydride (130–140°).
A 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, and a thermometer is charged with 115 g. (1.00 mole) of L-proline and 500 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide. To the stirred suspension are added simultaneously, over 5 minutes, 115 g. (1.00 mole) of 1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine and 214 g. (1.10 moles) of tert-butyl phenyl carbonate. The proline dissolves completely within a few minutes in an exothermic reaction, the temperature of which reaches a maximum of 50–52° after 10–15 minutes. After stirring for 3 hours, the clear reaction mixture is transferred to a 6-l. separatory funnel and shaken with 2.2 l. of water and 1.8 l. of diethyl ether. The aqueous layer, after being washed with 500 ml. of ether, is acidified to pH 3.0 by the addition of 10% sulfuric acid, which generally causes partial crystallization of the product. The acidic solution, including the solid, is extracted with three 600-ml. portions of a mixture of equal volumes of ethyl acetate and ether. The combined extracts are washed with three 25-ml. portions of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated with a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature not exceeding 40°. After drying in a vacuum oven at 50°, the crude product weighs 202 g., m.p. 129–132°. It is recrystallized from 300 ml. of hot ethyl acetate, and clarified by filtration and the addition of 1 l. of petroleum ether (40–60°), yielding, after drying under vacuum at 50°, 179–193 g. (83–90%) of tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-proline, m.p. 132–134°, [α]D25 −59.84° to −61.6° (c = 1, glacial acetic acid),(Note 9), and.
A. 2,2-Spirocyclohexane-4,5-diphenyl-2H-imidazole. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser is charged with 1.0 L of glacial acetic acid, 158 g (0.75 mol) of benzil, 400 g of ammonium acetate and 80 mL (0.77 mol) of cyclohexanone. The mixture is stirred and heated at reflux temperature for 1.5 hr and then, while hot, poured into 3 L of vigorously stirred water. The mixture is left overnight to cool to ambient temperature, the crystals are collected by filtration, washed 4 times with 300 mL of water, crushed in a mortar and dried under reduced pressure to give 205–210 g (95–97%) of the imidazole as yellowish-green crystals, mp 105–106°C, lit.3 mp 107–108°C.
(A) Diphenylselenium Dichloride.—One hundred twenty-five grams (0.53 mole) of diphenyl selenide (p. 238) is added in portions to 250 cc. (4 moles) of nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) in a 1.5-l. beaker. Hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is then added until precipitation is complete. About 170 cc. (2 moles) of acid is required. The mixture is then diluted with 500 cc. of water, and the yellow precipitate is separated by filtration and air-dried. The crude product is purified by extracting with 500 cc. of boiling benzene. The crystals which separate on cooling are collected on a filter and the filtrate is used for a further extraction. Three such treatments are necessary for a complete crystallization. The yield of yellow needles, decomposing at 187–188°, is 137–141 g. (85–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Although this material is suitable for most purposes, it may be purified further in the following manner. It is dissolved by heating in a solution of 2 g. of stannous chloride and 2 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 l. of water, and the hot solution is clarified by filtration through a 5-mm. mat of decolorizing carbon. The yellow or red color which may develop disappears on reheating to the boiling point. After the addition of 100 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid the solution is allowed to cool in an ice bath, treated with a second 100 cc. of acid, cooled to 0°, and collected and washed as before. The crystalline product is colorless, ash-free, and of analytical purity. The loss in the crystallization of an 80-g. lot amounts to 5–10 g. (6–12 per cent).
B. (S)-( − )-2-Acetoxy-1-bromopropane. A three-necked, 100-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel, and reflux condenser is charged with 7.6 g (0.1 mol) of (S)-( + )-propane-1,2-diol. A solution of 45% w/v hydrogen bromide–acetic acid (71 g, 0.3 mol) is added from the dropping funnel with cooling over ca. 5 min. The homogeneous solution is stirred at room temperature for 45 min, after which time it is added to 200 mL of water and the mixture neutralized immediately with solid sodium carbonate. The neutral solution is extracted three times with 150 mL of ethyl ether, the organic phases are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the crude product at reduced pressure affords 14.1–15.4 g (78–85%) of (S)-( − )-2-acetoxy-1-bromopropane, bp 54–57°C (7 mm), as a colorless liquid.
A dry, 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a 500-ml. dropping funnel, thermometer, a magnetic stirrer, and a reflux condenser protected from the atmosphere with a drying tube. The apparatus is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 150 ml. of dry dichloromethane and 21 ml. (0.16 mole) of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 440 (1988)] are added to the flask. The contents of the flask are cooled to 10°, and a solution of 23.0 g. (0.150 mole) of 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol in 450 ml. of dichloromethane is added dropwise at a fast rate (45 minutes). The reaction mixture is allowed to come to room temperature and poured into a beaker containing 300 g. of ice, decomposing any unreacted diethylaminosulfur trifluoride. The organic layer is separated, and the water layer is extracted twice with 45-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The organic layer and extracts are combined, washed with 150 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Evaporation to dryness under reduced pressure gives 20.9–22.1 g. (90–95%) of crude product. Recrystallization from 500 ml. of pentane yields 15.5 g. (67%) of 4-nitrobenzyl fluoride as colorless needle-shaped crystals, m.p. 36–37°.
In a carefully cleaned 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, covered with a watch glass, are placed 49.4 g. (0.35 mole) of N,N-dimethylcyclohexylmethylamine, 39.5 g. (0.35 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 45 ml. of methanol. The homogeneous solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 36 hours. After 2 and 5 hours hydrogen peroxide (39.5-g. portions each time) is added,. The excess hydrogen peroxide is destroyed by stirring the mixture with a small amount of platinum black until the evolution of oxygen ceases. The solution is filtered into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask and concentrated at a bath temperature of 50–60°, a water aspirator being used initially and an oil pump finally, until the amine oxide hydrate solidifies. A Teflon-covered stirring bar is introduced into the flask, which is then connected by a 20-cm. column to a trap (reversed to avoid plugging) cooled in Dry Ice-acetone. The flask is heated in an oil bath to 90–100°, and the apparatus is evacuated to a pressure of ca. 10 mm. with stirring of the liquefied amine oxide hydrate. When the content of the flask resolidifies, the temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160°. The amine oxide decomposes completely within about 2 hours at this temperature. Water (100 ml.) is added to the contents of the trap. The olefin layer is removed with a pipette and washed with two 5-ml. portions of water, two 5-ml. portions of ice-cold 10% hydrochloric acid,, and one 5-ml. portion of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution. The olefin is cooled in a Dry Ice-acetone bath and filtered through glass wool. Distillation over a small piece of sodium through a semimicro column2 yields 26.6–29.6 g. (79–88%) of methylenecyclohexane, b.p. 100–102°, n25D 1.4474.
The triethylamine hydrobromide precipitate is filtered and washed with two 60-mL portions of diethyl ether . The filtrate is washed with three 30-mL portions of 5% hydrochloric acid to remove unreacted triethylamine, and then washed with 25 mL of cold water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate , and filtered.
A. N,N,N-Trimethylcyclooctylammonium iodide. To a 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, condenser, drying tube, and pressure-equalizing dropping funnel are added 155.3 g. (1 mole) of N,N-dimethylcyclooctylamine and 700 ml. of reagent grade methanol. To the stirred solution is added 170.3 g. (1.2 moles) of iodomethane dropwise over a 30-minute period. The flask is cooled intermittently with an ice bath to keep the reaction temperature at approximately 25°. After 1 hour the bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir at 25° for an additional 3 hours.
(B) Acridone.—In a 500-cc. flask a solution of 42.7 g. (0.2 mole) of N-phenylanthranilic acid in 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is heated on a boiling water bath for four hours and then poured into 1 l. of boiling water. Spattering is minimized by allowing the solution to run down the wall of the container. The yellow precipitate is filtered after boiling for five minutes, and the filtrate is saved. The moist solid is boiled for five minutes with a solution of 30 g. (0.28 mole) of sodium carbonate in 400 cc. of water, collected with suction, and washed well with water. After drying in the air the crude acridone weighs 35.5–37.5 g. (91–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 344–346°. This material is pure enough for many purposes; it may be recrystallized from a mixture of aniline and acetic acid, using 10 cc. of aniline and 25 cc. of acetic acid for every 2 g. of solid. The recovery is about 90 per cent, and the recrystallized product melts at 348–352°.
For further purification a solution of the material in 350 cc. of chloroform is clarified if necessary and poured into 750 cc. of methyl alcohol, and the mixture is cooled to 0°. The yield of the pure acetate, m.p. 225–226°, [α]20°D + 42.5°, is 61–65 g. The constants are not altered by further crystallizations.
Triisopropylborate (39.9 mL, 98% purity, 170 mmol) is added dropwise over 50 min via a syringe pump to the above orange solution of (E)-crotylpotassium 1 to make sure that the internal temperature does not rise above -65 °C. After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool until the internal temperature remains constant around -72.5 °C, maintained at this temperature for 10 min, and then rapidly poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 1N HCl solution (320 mL) saturated with NaCl and shaken vigorously. The aqueous layer is adjusted to pH 1 by adding 1N HCl solution (110 mL), and then a solution of (S,S)-diisopropyl tartrate ((S,S)-DIPT) (40.6 g, 98% purity, 170 mmol) in Et2O (60 mL) is added and the mixture is shaken vigorously. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with Et2O (4 × 80 mL). The combined organic layers are dried with MgSO4 (120 g) over 2.5 h and then vacuum filtered through a fritted glass funnel under an argon blanket into a 1-L, oven-dried and pre-tared round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is washed with anhydrous Et2O (2 × 70 mL), and then the combined filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (from 40 mmHg to 10 mmHg at rt) to a colorless thick liquid, which is further concentrated on a vacuum line (0.5-1 mmHg) with stirring by a 5-cm, egg-shaped and pre-tared stir bar to constant weight (57 g). The crude product is dissolved in anhydrous toluene (120 mL) to form a clear solution (173 mL) of (S,S)-diisopropyl tartrate (E)-crotylboronate 2. The material so obtained has =98% isomeric purity, the resulting toluene solution has a reagent concentration of 0.65 mol/L, and the yield of reagent is 66% according to titration analysis.
In a 200-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser are mixed 31.4 ml. (38 g., 0.27 mole) of freshly distilled benzoyl chloride, 28.2 ml. (25 g., 0.35 mole) of tetrahydrofuran, and 5 g. of freshly fused zinc chloride. A vigorous reaction begins immediately, and after a few seconds, when the mixture starts to boil, external cooling is applied with an ice bath. After the initial reaction has subsided, the mixture is heated on a steam bath for 15 minutes, cooled, and dissolved in 100 ml. of benzene. The benzene solution is washed with 100 ml. of a 5% solution of sodium chloride and then with 100 ml. of a saturated solution of sodium bicarbonate. The benzene layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and fractionally distilled from a modified Claisen flask.
Either of two methods may be used to extract the mandelic acid from the ammonium chloride.
A solution of sodium hydroxide (106 g., 2.7 moles) in 535 ml. of water is placed in a 2-l. flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer and an outlet arranged for downward distillation into an ice-cooled receiver. The aqueous solution of the quaternary bromide is added dropwise to the boiling solution of sodium hydroxide during a period of 2.5–4 hours. The hexatriene and dimethylbenzylamine which form are distilled with the water. Distillation is continued for 10–15 minutes after the final addition of quaternary bromide solution. The clear upper layer of the distillate is separated, cooled to 5–10°, washed with three 170-ml. portions each of cold 2N hydrochloric acid and water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The oil is then distilled, a spinning-band column being used to give 32.0–34.0 g.. (54–60%) of 1,3,5-hexatriene; b.p. 80–80.5°, nD20 1.5103–1.5119.
E. Addition of disiamylborane to 1-octene. To the solution prepared in Section D is added a solution of 11.2 g. (0.100 mole) of 1-octene in 20 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran over a 30-minute period, while the reaction temperature is maintained below ca. 20°. The ice bath is removed and stirring is continued for one hour at room temperature.
Stirring is continued for ten minutes, and if necessary the solution is filtered rapidly through a loose cotton plug in a large funnel. An aqueous solution of 358 g. (2.16 moles) of potassium iodide is added and the reaction mixture allowed to stand overnight. The mixture is transferred to a large flask (or two smaller flasks) and heated on a steam bath, using an air-cooled reflux condenser, until no more gas is evolved, then allowed to cool and stand undisturbed until the heavy organic layer has settled thoroughly. A large part of the upper aqueous layer is siphoned off, and discarded. The residual aqueous and organic layers are made alkaline by the cautious addition of strong sodium hydroxide solution (100–125 g. of solid technical sodium hydroxide is usually required) and steam-distilled at once. The last one-third of the steam distillate is collected separately and combined with the aqueous layer separated from the earlier portions of the distillate. This mixture is acidified with 5–10 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid and steam-distilled again. The iodobenzene from this operation is combined with the main portion and dried with 10–15 g. of calcium chloride and. Distillation under reduced pressure gives 327–335 g. (74–76 per cent of the theoretical amount) of iodobenzene, b.p. 77–78°/20 mm. or 63–64°/8 mm..
A. Glutaric acid. To the solution of monoamide is added 200 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is heated under reflux in the hood for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is dried by brief heating on a steam bath at reduced pressure. The residual crystalline solid is broken up, ground in a mortar, and extracted with four 200-ml. portions of boiling chloroform. The combined hot extracts are filtered by gravity through a fluted paper on a heated funnel and then concentrated to about 400 ml. After the solution has been cooled in water to effect crystallization, the glutaric acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with cold chloroform, and dried. The yield of slightly discolored glutaric acid, suitable for many purposes, is 105–110 g. (79.5–83.5%), m.p. 95–97°.
A 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser (protected by a calcium chloride tube), is surrounded by a water bath. Sodium ethoxide is prepared in this flask by adding 31 g. (1.35 g. atoms) of sodium in portions to 450 ml. of absolute ethanol. When practically all the sodium has dissolved, 50 g. (0.39 mole) of dichloroacetic acid is added with stirring at such a rate that the solvent refluxes smoothly. About 20 minutes is required. Sodium chloride soon begins to separate, and the solution becomes a yellow-orange color. After the initial reaction subsides, the mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 3.5 hours.
In a 1-l. beaker 21.2 g. (0.1 mole) of o-tolidine is made into a thin paste with 300 cc. of water and dissolved by the addition of 20 cc. (23.6 g., 0.23 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), warming a little if necessary. The solution is cooled to 10° with ice, mechanical agitation is started, and 21 cc. (25 g., 0.24 mole) more of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. This causes partial separation of o-tolidine dihydrochloride. The temperature being kept at 10–15°, a solution of 14.5 g. (0.2 mole) of 95 per cent sodium nitrite in 40 cc. of water is run in rapidly, the last 10 per cent being held back and added slowly as needed to give a distinct positive test for nitrous acid on starch-iodide paper. This excess is maintained for one-half hour. Throughout the diazotization an excess of hydrochloric acid should be present as shown by a strong test on Congo red paper. When the diazotization is complete, the excess nitrous acid is eliminated by the careful addition of a small amount of o-tolidine hydrochloride solution, using starch-iodide paper to arrive at an exact balance.
When the exothermic reaction is ended, the slurry of product is stirred and refluxed for 5 hours to ensure complete reaction. The mixture is then cooled and filtered. The product is washed by suspension in hot water, filtered, and dried. The yield is 68–79 g. (75–87%). The product melts at 227–228°.
One of the separatory funnels is filled with dilute sulfuric acid prepared by the careful addition of 392 g. (213 cc., 4 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid to 830 cc. of water. The other separatory funnel is filled with a solution of 203 g. (4 moles) of commercial sodium cyanide (about 96 per cent) dissolved in sufficient water to make 500 cc. of solution. Evolution of hydrogen cyanide takes place on the simultaneous addition of the two solutions. Practically all the reaction occurs in the funnel, F, and the sodium bisulfate solution continuously drains into the flask so that fresh solutions are always present. The solution in the funnel remains clear as long as sufficient sulfuric acid is present. An excess of sodium cyanide colors the solution yellow and leads to the formation of a muddy brown precipitate. By adjusting the flow of solutions the rate of evolution is easily controlled, and the preparation requires no attention beyond that involved in the occasional replenishment of the solutions in the separatory funnels. The last part of the hydrogen cyanide can be driven from the apparatus by boiling the bisulfate solution for a few minutes. The yield of acid melting at − 15° to − 14.5° is 100–105 g. (93–97 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
The reaction mixture is quenched by adding a solution of 12 g (200 mmol) of glacial acetic acid in 20 mL of diethyl ether at −50°C and is then poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 500 mL of ether and 70 mL of water. The organic layer is washed successively with 40 mL each of saturated sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride solution, and the aqueous phases are extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are dried by vigorous stirring with dry MgSO4 for 15 min. Removal of the solvent first with a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature no higher than 35°C and then at room temperature under oil pump vacuum (0.1 mm) furnishes 10.4 g of a yellow oil consisting, according to capillary gas chromatography (GC), of 81.3% of the desired allylated (2S,3R) product (73.5% yield), 8.5% of the (2S,3S) diastereoisomer (90.5% ds2), and 6.3% of the starting diethyl malate.
Forty-six grams (2 gram atoms) of sodium, cut into small pieces, is added to 1 l. of absolute ethyl alcohol in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser with a calcium chloride tube. When all the sodium is in solution, 320 g. (2 moles) of ethyl malonate is added. Then 200 g. (2.1 moles) of methyl bromide is bubbled into the stirred solution through a tube (at least 4 mm. in diameter) in the third neck of the flask which dips to the bottom of the solution.
The reaction mixture is now diluted with a equal volume of water, and when cool is poured, with stirring, into 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. After the solution has cooled to room temperature, the m-nitrobenzoic acid is filtered off by means of suction. This crude acid when dry weighs 150–160 g. (90–96 per cent of the theoretical amount). It has a light brownish color, melts at 140°, and should be completely soluble in ether, thus showing the absence of salts. This acid is satisfactory for many purposes, but in order to prepare a perfectly pure product it must be crystallized once from 1 per cent aqueous hydrochloric acid. A light cream-colored product is thus obtained with a loss of about 5 per cent of the material.
A. 2,2,2-Trichloroethyl acetimidate hydrochloride. To a 50-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermocouple inserted into the septum and a magnetic stir bar is added acetonitrile (13.0 mL, 248 mmol, 1.19 equiv) and trichloroethanol (20.0 mL, 208 mmol, 1.00 equiv). The flask is capped with a vacuum receiving tube that has the central inlet extended with an Eppendorf pipet tip secured with teflon tape such that the pipet tip extends well into the solution inside the flask. The central inlet of the vacuum receiving tube is connected to a hydrogen chloride gas cylinder using Tygon tubing, and the outlet of the vacuum receiving tube is connected via Tygon tubing to an empty 2-necked 150-mL round-bottomed flask that is in turn connected via Tygon tubing to a scrubber. The acetonitrile and trichloroethanol solution is cooled to 0 - 5 °C using an ice bath, and HCl gas is bubbled into the solution for 5 h while maintaining the internal temperature at 0 - 5 °C. A rate of 10-15 bubbles/min at the scrubber is maintained throughout the 5 h reaction time. After complete reaction, the flow of HCl gas is stopped; the reaction flask is removed from the ice bath and the stopper removed for approximately 5 min. Seed is added to the flask (1 wt%), which is then sealed with a glass stopper and placed in a refrigerator kept at 0 °C for 66 h. The product crystallizes as a single solid white mass that is broken up using a spatula and then filtered. The large crystals are further crushed, washed with cold acetonitrile (approx. 0 °C, 3 x 15 mL), and dried in a vacuum oven (125-250 mmHg) at 45 °C to a constant weight to afford 3 as a white solid (42.8-46.0 g, 91-97%).
The reaction mixture is then added with good stirring to a slurry of 800–900 g. of ice and 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The layers are separated, and the dark organic layer is washed with three 100-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid and discarded. Traces of non-basic organic material are removed from the combined aqueous layer and washings by extraction with pure ether until the extract is colorless. The aqueous solution is treated with 600 ml. of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide with cooling, and the basic organic product is extracted with three 125-ml. portions of pure ether. The ethereal solution is dried over sodium sulfate, and the solvent is distilled on the steam bath to give 42–46 g. of a clear, amber product. To this crude product is added 10 g. of triethylenetetramine. Distillation through a small Vigreux column yields 21.5–30 g. (48–67%, based on trichloramine) of 1-amino-1-methylcyclohexane, b.p. 44–49° (20–25 mm.), n22D 1.4516.
In a dry 500-ml. three-necked flask, equipped with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel and protected from atmospheric moisture with drying tubes, are placed 6.0 g. (0.16 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride and 200 ml. of anhydrous ether. A solution of 43 g. (0.307 mole) of 3-ethoxy-2-cyclohexenone in 50 ml. of anhydrous ether is added, dropwise and with stirring, to the reaction flask at a rate which maintains gentle refluxing of the solvent. After the addition is complete, the reaction solution is boiled under reflux for an additional 30 minutes and then allowed to cool. The complex is hydrolyzed and the excess lithium aluminum hydride is destroyed by the cautious addition, dropwise and with stirring, of 15 ml. of water. The resulting reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml. of cold aqueous 10% sulfuric acid. The ether layer which forms is separated, and the residual aqueous phase is extracted with three 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed successively with one 100-ml. portion of water and one 100-ml. portion of saturated, aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and then dried over magnesium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation through a 50-cm. Vigreux column, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a 40-cm. spinning-band column. The yield of 2-cyclohexenone, b.p. 56–57.5°/10 mm. or 96–97°/72 mm., nD27 1.4858, is 18.2–22.1 g. (62–75%).
Water (500 ml.) and 500 ml. of ether are added to the residue, and the mixture is well stirred. The mixture is transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the two layers are carefully separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two additional 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined organic layers are washed twice with 5% sodium hydroxide solution and then with water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The dark residue is transferred to a distillation flask and distilled through a 30-cm. Vigreux column to yield a crystalline fraction, b.p. 130–155° (13 mm.). Recrystallization of this distillate from ligroin gives 68–80 g. (45–53%, based on chloramine added) of 1,3-dihydro-3,5,7-trimethyl-2H-azepin-2-one as a fluffy white solid, m.p. 131–132°.
A 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel. A solution of 181 g. (1 mole) of ethyl α-bromopropionate in 200 ml. of benzene is placed in the flask, and 148 g. (2.1 moles) of pyrrolidine is added slowly with stirring at such a rate that the solvent refluxes gently. When the addition is complete (about 1 hour is required), the mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour. After being cooled, the mixture is poured into about 500 ml. of ice water and acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid. The aqueous layer is separated, washed once with ether, and made strongly basic with cold 40% sodium hydroxide solution. The basic ester is extracted with four 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined, washed with 100 ml. of water, and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the ether by distillation. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure through a short fractionating column; b.p. 84°/12 mm. (95–96°/19 mm., 99.5–100.5°/23 mm., 104–105°/30 mm.); nD20 1.4478, nD25 1.4450; d425 0.9724. The yield is 137–156 g. (80–91%).
A. Dimethyl (E)-2-hexenedioate.2 A 100-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is capped by a septum, swept with dry nitrogen and flame-dried. The flask is charged with methyl acrylate (50 mL, 0.55 mol,), then anhydrous lithium tetrafluoroborate (9 g, 0.096 mol,), and finally tetrakis(acetonitrile)palladium tetrafluoroborate (1.33 g, 0.003 mmol,). The mixture is stirred briefly until homogeneous. It is warmed under nitrogen in a 40°C oil bath for 72 hr and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The mixture is added to saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (100 mL) and extracted with ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to an oil with a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to give dimethyl (E)-2-hexenedioate (38.6 g, 81%,) as a colorless liquid, bp 100°C (1.1 mm).
A. Methyl coumalate. In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask provided with a thermometer is placed 139 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. To the acid is added, with swirling, 50 g. (0.36 mole) of pulverized coumalic acid (p. 201) in small portions. The reaction is slightly exothermic, and the mixture is maintained between 20° and 30° by occasional immersion of the flask into an ice bath. Methanol (70 ml.) is then added in small portions with frequent swirling, and the temperature is held between 25° and 35°. The mixture is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour, cooled to about 40°, and poured slowly with stirring into 800 ml. of water in a 2-l. beaker while the temperature is maintained below 40° by an ice bath. Anhydrous sodium carbonate is added in small portions with stirring until the mixture is slightly alkaline. The precipitated ester is freed of inorganic salts by slurrying four times with 100-ml. portions of cold water, filtered, and air-dried overnight. The yield of methyl coumalate, m.p. 68–70°, is 17.5–24.5 g. (32–45%). This crude product is used for the preparation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid.
B. 2-Acetyl-6,7-dimethoxy-1-methylene-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser topped with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer is charged with 110 ml. of acetic anhydride, 110 ml. of pyridine, and 45.0 g. (0.220 mole) of the dihydroisoquinoline prepared in Part A. The reaction mixture is stirred and heated at 90–95° for 30 minutes, stored at room temperature overnight, and concentrated by distillation at 50° using a rotary evaporator. The residue is diluted with 20 ml. of ethyl acetate, and another evaporation under reduced pressure gives material that can be crystallized from 75 ml. of ethyl acetate to yield 38.5–41.0 g. (72–77%) of product m.p., 106–107°.
When the reaction is complete, the mixture is cooled, and the solution is decanted from the sodium bromide. The salt is washed with 100 cc. of absolute alcohol, and the washings are added to the main solution. The alcohol is separated from the substituted acetoacetic ester by distilling through a short column from a steam bath. The crude residue after removal of the alcohol weighs about 925 g. It is satisfactory for hydrolysis to give the corresponding ketone (p. 351). If the pure ester is desired, the crude product is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 112–117°/16 mm. is 642–672 g. (69–72 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Methyl nitroacetate. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer is charged with 70 g. (0.39 mole) of finely powdered dipotassium salt of nitroacetic acid and 465 ml. (11.6 moles) of methanol.
The residue, when completely dry, is ground up, mixed to a paste with dry ether, filtered by suction, washed with dry ether, and dried. The product so obtained is practically pure and melts at 160–161°. The yield is 474–479 g. (95–96 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 2-(1-Phenylcyclopentyl)-4,4,6-trimethyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazine. A 600-ml. beaker containing a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 200 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, 200 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 25.0 g. (0.0922 mole) of the oxazine obtained in Part A. The mixture is stirred and cooled to −35 to −40° with an acetone bath to which dry ice is added as needed. A 9 N hydrochloric acid solution is added dropwise to the stirred solution until an approximate pH of 7 is obtained as determined by pH paper. A solution of sodium borohydride is prepared by dissolving 5.0 g. (0.13 mole) in a minimum amount of water (5–8 ml.) to which 1 drop of 40% sodium hydroxide is added. The sodium borohydride solution and 9 N hydrochloric acid solution are alternately added dropwise to the stirred solution so that a pH 6–8 is maintained. During the addition care is taken to maintain a temperature between −35 and −45°. After addition of the borohydride solution is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at −35° for 1 hour. A pH of 7 is maintained by occasional addition of 9 N hydrochloric acid. The reaction mixture is then stored at −20° overnight.
A. 2,3-Epoxycyclohexanone. A 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a thermometer is charged with a solution of 9.60 g. (0.100 mole) of 2-cyclohexen-1-one in 100 ml. of methanol. After the solution is cooled to 1–3° in an ice bath, 34 g. (30 ml., 0.30 mole) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added. The mixture is stirred vigorously and kept well cooled in the ice bath, and 0.15 ml. (0.75 mmole) of 20% aqueous sodium hydroxide is added in one portion. The temperature of the reaction mixture rises to approximately 30° within a few minutes then falls again to 3–5°. Fifteen minutes after addition of the sodium hydroxide solution, the cold reaction mixture is poured into a 1-l. separatory funnel containing 150 g. of ice and 200 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The resulting suspension is extracted with 200 ml. of dichloromethane. After two further extractions of the aqueous layer with 150-ml. portions of dichloromethane, the combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is removed by distillation through a 30-cm. Vigreux column. Distillation of the residue through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure affords a forerun fraction of approximately 0.7 g., b.p. 60–75° (11 mm.), then 8.4–8.6 g. (75–77% of pure 2,3-epoxycyclohexanone and, b.p. 75–77° (11 mm.), nD20 1.4748, d420 1.129.
To 340 g. (6 moles) of dry, powdered potassium hydroxide in a 500-cc. short-necked round-bottomed flask is added 167 g. (1 mole) of β-chloropropionaldehyde acetal (p. 137). The mixture is shaken vigorously and attached at once to a three-bulbed Glinsky or other suitable column, connected to a water condenser set for distillation. The flask is heated in an oil bath at 210–220° until nothing more distils. The distillate is transferred to a separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer is removed. The acrolein acetal is dried over 10 g. of potassium carbonate, filtered, and distilled from a modified Claisen flask (Fig. 2). The yield is 98 g. (75 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which boils at 122–126°.
A. Tetrachlorobenzobarrelene. A carefully dried, 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar, a low-temperature thermometer, a 500-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel bearing a gas-inlet tube, and a Nujol bubbler is charged with 28.5 g. (0.100 mole) of hexachlorobenzene. The apparatus is flushed with argon or nitrogen before 600 ml. of dry diethyl ether is added. The resulting suspension is stirred and cooled to −72° to −78° in a 4-l. acetone–dry ice bath. A solution of n-butyllithium (0.110 mole) in hexane is added over a 30-minute period such that the temperature does not exceed −70°. The mixture is then allowed to warm to −60° over an additional 1.5 hours. Four liters of dry, thiophene-free benzene is added to the pentachlorophenyllithium solution over a 1-hour interval, during which the temperature rises to ca. + 10°. The mixture is allowed to warm slowly to room temperature over a period of at least 14 hours and then is heated at +30° for another 2 hours to ensure complete reaction. A 10-g. portion of solid ammonium chloride is added, and 15 minutes later the contents of the flask are filtered through 20 g. of Celite. The volume of the filtrate is reduced to 75 ml. with a rotary evaporator, and 100 g. of alumina is added to the concentrate in a 250-ml. flask. The rotary evaporation is continued until the weight remains constant and a free-flowing consistency is attained. The material is placed on a column packed with 800 g. of alumina and eluted with low-boiling petroleum ether. Fractions of ca. 200 ml. are collected and analyzed by GC or TLC ((Note 6)), with the appropriate fractions combined and evaporated, providing 16.9–17.5 g. (58–60%,) of essentially pure tetrachlorobenzobarrelene, m.p. 127–129°.
The yield of crude product may be increased 50–60 g.—making a total of 300–320 g. (89–95 per cent of the theoretical amount)—by working up the mother liquors. The alcoholic liquors and washings are diluted to 6 l., and the aqueous layer is separated from the heavy oil at the bottom. The benzene is then distilled from the oil in a distilling flask, care being taken not to overheat the product after the benzene has been removed. The residual tribromobenzene may be recrystallized in the manner described above.
The mixture is finally cooled and the ethereal solution carefully decanted from the solid, which is carefully rinsed twice with 250-cc. portions of dry ether. The united liquids are then distilled from a water bath held at 46–60°, the residue is fractionated with a column, and the fractions boiling at the following points are collected: up to 110°; at 110–115°; at 115–117°; and at 117–140°. The portion boiling at 115–117° is pure epichlorohydrin; the lower and higher fractions are systematically redistilled, yielding a further quantity of pure material. The yield is 705–747 g. (76–81 per cent of the theoretical amount). The residue, varying from 16 to 150 g., consists of nearly pure glycerol dichlorohydrin, and may be employed in subsequent runs.
A mixture of 150 g. (2.5 moles) of urea, 125 g. (1.25 moles) of reprecipitated calcium carbonate, and 150 ml. of water in a 2-l. three-necked flask is tared and cooled in an ice-salt bath. The flask is equipped with a thermometer which extends into the reaction mixture, a gas inlet tube, an outlet tube leading to a gas-absorption trap,2 and a slip- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer which will disperse chlorine gas below the surface of the liquid.
An ethanolic solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask from 15.5 g. (0.67 gram atom) of sodium and 300 ml. of absolute ethanol. One hundred thirty-three grams (0.64 mole) of phenylmethylglycidic ester (p. 727) is added to this solution slowly and with shaking. The flask is then cooled externally to 15°, and 15 ml. of water is slowly added; considerable heat is evolved, and the sodium salt soon begins to separate. After the mixture has stood overnight, the salt is filtered by suction and rinsed with one 50-ml. portion of ethanol and a similar amount of ether. The dried salt weighs 102–108 g. (80–85%) and melts at 255–256° with decomposition.
C. (1R,2R)-1,2-Diphenylethane-1,2-diol. A 500-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser (fitted with an argon inlet), a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum, and a thermocouple is charged with (4-((4R,5R)-4,5-diphenyl-1,3- dioxolan-2-yl) phenoxy) (tert-butyl)dimethylsilane (10.8 g, 25.0 mmol), K2CO3 (17.3 g, 125 mmol), MeOH (200 mL), and water (50 mL). After addition of KF (1.46 g, 25.0 mmol) and stirring for 5 min followed by addition of NH2OH·HCl (8.69 g, 125 mmol), the reaction mixture is heated in an 85 °C oil bath (internal temperature: 69 °C) and is stirred for 37 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and is decanted into sat. brine (150 mL) in a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted with EtOAc (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with 3 M NaOH (3 × 100 mL), H2O (100 mL), and brine (100 mL), and then are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 (20 g), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (21 °C 30 mmHg) to afford 5.40 g of the crude diol as a white solid. Purification by recrystallization yields (1R,2R)-1,2- diphenylethane-1,2-diol as white crystals (4.65 g, 87%).
A. 1,1,1',1'-Tetraethoxyethyl polysulfide. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser, and an addition funnel, 540 g. (2.25 moles) of sodium sulfide enneahydrate is dissolved in 2.7 l. of boiling 95% ethanol. Sulfur (144 g., 4.5 g. atoms) is added, and the solution is heated under reflux until it has assumed a deep-red color (10 minutes). The source of heat is removed, and 588 g. (3 moles) of diethyl bromoacetal is added over a period of about 30 minutes at such a rate that the solution boils gently. The mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 4 hours. During the last hour of heating, ethanol is allowed to distil from the reaction flask, and after the first 700 ml. of distillate is collected sodium bicarbonate (135 g.) is added to the reaction mixture. A total of 2.0–2.5 l. of ethanol is collected. Water (1.5 l.) is added, and the upper layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 250-ml. portions of ether, and the combined organic layers are washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, three 100-ml. portions of water, and two 250-ml. portions of saturated sodium chloride solution, and are dried over potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is brought to constant weight by heating for about 1 hour on the steam bath at 10–15 mm. pressure. The orange liquid obtained in this way weighs 450–500 g. and has n25D 1.515–1.517.
B. Trimethylvinyltin. To a dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Dewar-type condenser cooled to −78°C, a magnetic stirring bar and a gas inlet leading to a static supply of dry argon are added 11.4 g (0.469 mol) of clean magnesium turnings, 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, 3 mL of vinyl bromide, and 0.3 mL of methyl iodide to initiate formation of vinylmagnesium bromide. To this is added a solution of 41 mL (0.624 mol or 66.7 g total) of vinyl bromide in 125 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran via cannula at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux. After addition the mixture is heated to reflux for 1 hr with an oil bath and then cooled to 60°C.
The spiroacylal 2 is potentially a valuable agent in organic synthesis.8 It is readily attacked by a variety of nucleophiles, including pyridine, to give ring-opened products bearing a stabilized carbanion. It is thus seen to be a synthetic equivalent of ⊕ CH2-CH2-CH(CO2H)2 and ⊕ CH2(CH2)2-CO2H, i.e., a homo-Michael acceptor. The general reaction is
The flask is charged with about 3 l. of liquid ammonia, the stirrer is started, and a rapid stream of acetylene gas (about 5 bubbles per second) is passed in for about 5 minutes to saturate the ammonia. The acetylene from a tank is sufficiently purified by passage through a sulfuric acid wash bottle; a safety trap also should be inserted in the line. Sodium (92 g., 4 g. atoms) is cut in strips (about ½ by ½ by 3 in.) so that they can be inserted through the side neck of the flask. One of these pieces of sodium is attached to the fish-hook and is gradually lowered into the liquid ammonia while a rapid stream of acetylene is passed in. The sodium should be added at such a rate that the entire solution does not turn blue. If it does, the sodium should be raised above the level of the ammonia until the color is discharged. The rest of the sodium is added in a similar manner; the addition requires about 45 minutes, depending on the rate of passage of the acetylene.
A. 5-(p-Hydroxybenzal)hydantoin. An intimate mixture of 6.11 g. (0.050 mole) of p-hydroxybenzaldehyde and 5.5 g. (0.055 mole) of hydantoin is placed in a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask. Dry piperidine (10 ml.) is added, a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride tube is fitted to the flask, and the flask is immersed in an oil bath so that the level of the reaction mixture is the same as the oil level of the bath. The oil bath is heated slowly to 130° and is held at this temperature for 30 minutes; foaming and gentle boiling occur. The reaction mixture is cooled, and 200 ml. of water at about 60° is added. The contents of the flask are stirred by means of a glass rod until a clear red solution is obtained. Any traces of tarry material are removed by filtration. The solution is cooled to room temperature, transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and acidified by dropwise addition of 20 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid. The mixture stands at room temperature a few hours, and then the yellow precipitate of 5-(p-hydroxybenzal)hydantoin is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with cold water. After being dried in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide, the crude hydantoin weighs 8.5–8.8 g. (83–86%). It melts at 310–315° (dec.) and is sufficiently pure for the next step and other preparative purposes.
(C) Synthesis of Diphenic Acid.—The reducing solution in the 2-l. beaker is surrounded by an ice bath so that the temperature of the solution is Kept at about 10°. The beaker is fitted with a mechanical stirrer. The stem of a 100-cc. cylindrical dropping funnel is fitted with a glass tube which dips well below the surface of the solution and is bent upward at the end and constricted so that the opening is about 2 mm.. An 80- to 90-cc. portion of the diazonium solution is placed in the dropping funnel and added at the rate of about 10 cc. per minute. The remainder of the diazonium solution is added at the same rate and stirring is continued for five minutes longer.
B. Azoethane. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel is charged with 500 ml. of an aqueous 2 M solution of sodium hydroxide and 152 g. (1.00 mole) of N,N'-diethylsulfamide, which is brought into solution by warming the reaction flask. The reaction flask is cooled in a cold water bath before 715 ml. (1.0 mole) of aqueous 1.4 M sodium hypochlorite is added dropwise with stirring. After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for 15 minutes at room temperature. The mixture is brought to pH 1 by addition of 6 M hydrochloric acid and stirred for an additional 30 minutes at 60°. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, then is brought to pH 14 by addition of aqueous 2 M sodium hydroxide. Addition of 715 ml. (1.0 mole) of aqueous 1.4 M sodium hypochlorite solution causes the separation of azoethane as an oil, having a fruitlike odor. The mixture is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of toluene. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and distilled through a 50-cm. packed column, yielding 44–46 g. (51–54%) of azoethane, b.p. 58–59°, n20D 1.3861.
B. 2,6-Dimethoxybenzonitrile. The crude nitrile is placed in a 3-l. flask and is refluxed for 2 hours with a solution of 75 g. of potassium hydroxide in 1.9 l. of methanol. The solution is concentrated by distillation to a volume of 400 ml. and then is poured into 4 l. of cold water. The brownish solid is filtered, washed thoroughly with cold water, and dried. The crude product (85–95 g.) is dissolved in 300 ml. of chloroform and refluxed with 8 g. of Darco for 30 minutes. The hot mixture is filtered, and 500 ml. of hot petroleum ether (b.p. 60–90°) is added to the filtrate. The solution is cooled, and the light-tan-colored needles of 2,6-dimethoxybenzonitrile are removed by filtration. The product weighs 75–86 g. (15–17%) and melts at 116–117°.
A. 1-Methoxy-2-methylpyridinium methyl sulfate. In a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a Hirshberg stirrer, a thermometer which extends deep into the flask, and a 250-ml. pressure-equalizing, dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube is placed 109 g. (1.0 mole) of dry powdered 2-picoline-1-oxide. The stirrer is started at a slow rate, and 126 g. (1.0 mole) of dimethyl sulfate is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture slowly rises to between 80° and 90° and remains in this range throughout the addition. When the addition is about two-thirds complete, gentle heating with a steam bath is necessary to maintain this temperature. After complete addition (about 1 hour), the mixture is heated for an additional 2 hours on a steam bath at 90–100°. The molten salt is then poured into a large evaporating dish and placed in a vacuum desiccator under partial vacuum to cool. The salt is obtained as a white crystalline mass in essentially quantitative yield (235 g.) and.
Solvent removal at reduced pressure gives 61 g (67% yield) of essentially pure ethyl hydroxycrotonate.
In a 5-l. flask, provided with a two-holed stopper fitted with a 90-cm. fractionating column1 and a dropping funnel, are placed 1500 g. (12.3 moles) of benzoic acid, 1500 g. (1390 cc., 14.7 moles) of acetic anhydride (or an equivalent quantity of 95 per cent acetic anhydride), and 1 cc. of sirupy phosphoric acid. The mixture is very slowly distilled, at such a rate that the temperature of the vapor at the head of the column does not exceed 120°. When 250 cc. of distillate has been collected, 250 g. of acetic anhydride is added, and distillation is continued. This process is again repeated, so that in all 2000 g. (1850 cc., 19.6 moles) of acetic anhydride has been taken. Fractionation is then continued, fractions which distil respectively below 120°, at 120–130°, and at 130–140° being collected. Heating is continued until the temperature of the reaction mixture in the flask reaches 270°.
The amine distils at 239–240°/740 mm., 242° (cor.)/760 mm., 110°/10 mm., or 92–94°/2 mm. In the first distillation the portion boiling below 225°/740 mm. (or below 100°/9 mm.) is discarded. The yield is 130–135 g. (87–90%).
The chloroform layer is distilled to dryness and the residue is dissolved in 1.5 l. of acetone under reflux. The hot acetone solution is filtered and then allowed to cool in a refrigerator. Yellow 4,4'-bis(dimethylamino)benzil crystallizes from the acetone solution. It is separated by filtration and washed with 100 ml. of cold methanol. After being dried in air, it weighs 28–31 g. (38–42%); m.p. 200–202°; λmaxCH3OH 371 mμ(ε 44,700).
In the latter method, after removal of all the water, an additional 100 ml. of water is added and the distillation is repeated to remove the remaining nitric acid. The solid residue remaining from either method of removing water from the reaction mixture is recrystallized from a mixture of 100 ml. of ether and 1 l. of benzene. Insoluble sodium nitrate and succinic acid are removed by filtration of the hot solution. Upon cooling, 185–198 g. (70–75%) of glutaric acid is obtained in the first crop, m.p. 89.5–91.5°. On concentrating the benzene solution to 200 ml. and cooling, an additional 18–23 g. of crude glutaric acid can be obtained.
A. Ethyl 2,5-dimethylphenylhydroxymalonate. One hundred and seventy-four grams (1 mole) of ethyl oxomalonate and 265 g. (2.5 moles) of p-xylene are mixed in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a good stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a calcium chloride drying tube. Suitable precautions are taken to exclude moisture from the reaction mixture. While the mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath and stirred vigorously, 325 g. (1.25 moles) of anhydrous stannic chloride is added dropwise from the funnel. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 3 hours. The reaction mixture is poured with stirring into about 300 g. of cracked ice containing 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. On standing this mixture separates into two layers. Two hundred milliliters of ether is added, and the ether layer is washed with 100-ml. portions of water until the wash water is free from chlorides. The ether solution is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate and distilled. After removal of the ether and the excess of reagents, the fraction boiling at 154–156°/5 mm. is collected. The yield of 2,5-dimethylphenylhydroxymalonic ester is 144.5–160 g. (51.5–57%).
A. A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum and nitrogen inlet. The flask is charged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL) followed by diisopropylamine (4.60 mL, 32.8 mmol). The solution is stirred at 0°C and BuLi is added (2.5 M solution in hexane, 12.2 mL, 30.4 mmol). After 15 min, tributyltin hydride (7.70 mL, 27.8 mmol,) is added and the resulting yellow solution is stirred for 20 min. The solution is cooled to −78°C by means of a dry ice-acetone bath and crotonaldehyde (2.10 mL, 25.3 mmol,) is added. After 30 min a solution of 1,1'-(azodicarbonyl)dipiperidine (ADD) (8.31 g, 32.9 mmol,) in THF (65 mL) is added by means of a cannula. The resulting dark red reaction mixture is warmed to 0°C and stirred for 1 hr. The reaction is then quenched with 100 mL of aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution and extracted with two 100-mL portions of ether . The aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with 100 mL of ether . The organic extracts are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and the solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation to a volume of 100 mL. The orange solution is separated from a yellow precipitate by means of a cannula into a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer and containing 1 L of vigorously stirring hexane under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting mixture is filtered through a glass-fritted funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation to afford the crude acyl stannane as a clear orange oil. This oil is dissolved in 65 mL of THF and immediately subjected to reduction with 2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl-lithium aluminum hydride (BINAL-H) (Part B).
B. 1,3,5-Hexatriene. In a 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a graduated dropping funnel are placed 114 g. (0.42 mole) of phosphorus tribromide and 2 drops of 48% hydrobromic acid. As the contents of the flask are stirred and maintained at 10–15° by means of an ice-water bath, 98 g. (1.00 mole) of 1,5-hexadien-3-ol is added in the course of 1.5 to 1.75 hours. The mixture is allowed to stir at 10–15° for 40 minutes and then to stand at room temperature overnight. The flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath for 20 minutes, and the upper organic layer is decanted from the residue while still cold. The organic layer is successively washed with three 40-ml. portions each of ice water, 5% sodium bicarbonate, and water. The crude bromohexadiene weighs 147–153 g. (91–95%).
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed flask with a short neck (not longer than 3 cm.) are placed 100 g. (0.67 mole) of phthalic anhydride, 110 g. (0.8 mole) of phenylacetic acid (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 436), and 2.6 g. of freshly fused sodium acetate. A few chips of porous plate are added, and the flask is provided with a cork bearing a thermometer, which reaches almost to the bottom, and a wide, bent glass tube leading to a condenser. The tube ends just at the lower edge of the cork and does not protrude into the neck of the flask. The flask is imbedded up to the neck in a sand bath and is heated rapidly until the thermometer reaches 230°; then the temperature is raised slowly until the water produced in the reaction and some entrained organic matter pass out through the exit tube. The water is collected in a small vessel and its quantity noted from time to time in order to follow the progress of the reaction. The operation should be conducted so that the temperature rises from 230 to 240° in the course of about two hours. The reaction is maintained at 240° until the distillation of water ceases; this requires about one additional hour.
A. α-Hydroxy-N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine. A 500-mL three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer (teflon paddle, 75 × 20 mm), a glass stopper, and a reflux condenser fitted with an inert gas inlet is charged with benzyl carbamate (30.23 g, 200 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and glyoxylic acid monohydrate (20.25 g, 220 mmol, 1.1 equiv). The flask is evacuated and backfilled with inert gas, the glass stopper is removed under a stream of inert gas and the flask is charged with anhydrous Et2O (200 mL). The resulting translucent solution is heated under reflux for 12 h with stirring at a rate of 200 rpm. Over this time, the product precipitates to give a white suspension. The white precipitate is collected by filtration, washed with hexanes-Et2O (1:1) (6 × 10 mL), and dried in vacuo to yield α-hydroxy-N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine as fine white crystals (32.80-35.37 g, 73-79%).
A solution of 92 g (0.58 mol) of bromine in 60 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise over 1 hr while the reaction mixture is vigorous stirred. Instantaneous decoloration of bromine and formation of a precipitate of dibromotriphenylphosphorane(Ph3PBr2) is observed. After the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min while being cooled in the ice bath.
Methanol (225 ml.) is placed in a 500-ml. two-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. Sodium (6.8 g., 0.30 g. atom) in small pieces is dropped down the condenser into the stirred methanol. The resultant solution is cooled to room temperature, and 64 g. (0.30 mole) of 1-phenylbiguanide hydrochloride is added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 20 minutes. The sodium chloride that precipitates is separated on a Büchner funnel and washed with 25 ml. of methanol.
A. 1,2:5,6-Diisopropylidene-D-mannitol. A 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with overhead stirrer, heating mantle, and condenser with drying tube is charged with 100 g of D-mannitol (0.549 mol), 240 mL of freshly-distilled 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and 160 mL of 2,2-dimethoxypropane (1.3 mol). Stirring is begun and 0.1 g of stannous chloride is added. The remaining neck is capped with a septum and the stirred slurry is heated to reflux. Reflux is maintained until the mixture becomes clear (30–50 min) and is continued for 30 min after clarity is attained. The heating mantle is removed and the solution is cooled below reflux. Pyridine (200 μL) is added through the septum via syringe. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is transferred to a tared, 1-L, one-necked flask, and the contents are concentrated on a rotary evaporator, beginning at room temperature and increasing the temperature to 95–100°C. The flask contents are held at that temperature until no more evaporate is collected (15–30 min). The semi-solid is then cooled to room temperature, to yield 130–160 g of crude solid product of 50–55% purity (72–80 g, 50–56% yield) as assayed by 1H NMR against dichloromethane.
B. (S)-2-(N,N-Dibenzylamino)-3-phenyl-1-propanol. A dry, 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a dropping funnel, is charged with 60 mL of dry diethyl ether and 1.13 g (30 mmol) of lithium aluminum hydride under an atmosphere of argon. The suspension is cooled to 0°C, and 10.9 g (25 mmol) of benzyl (S)-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-3-phenylpropanoate in 10 mL of diethyl ether are added dropwise. The mixture is stirred for 16 hr at room temperature and cooled again to 0°C. The mixture is carefully worked up by the dropwise and sequential addition of 1.1 mL of water, 1.1 mL of a 15% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and an additional 3.4 mL of water. The reaction mixture is filtered through a coarse filtration frit to remove aluminum salts, and the latter are washed four times with 8-mL portions of diethyl ether . The combined filtrates and washings are dried over magnesium sulfate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Most of the benzyl alcohol is removed under high vacuum (10−5 mbar, 0.75 × 10−5 mm) at a bath temperature of 50°-60°C. The crude product is then purified by flash chromatography ( 100 g of 230-400 mesh silica gel ; hexane/ethyl acetate 95:5, v:v) or recrystallized from hexane to afford 6.2-7.2 g (75-87% yield) of a white solid having a melting point of 67°C and an optical rotation of [α]20 D +35.6° ( CH2Cl2 , c 1.91). The enantiomeric purity as measured by HPLC [Varian 5560; chiral stationary phase: 250 mm Chiralcel OD-H, 4.6 mm i. d.; mobile phase: heptane : 2-propanol = 90 : 10; T/p/F: 308 K/3.2 Mpa/0.5 mL/min; sample volume: 5 μL (2.3 mg in 0.5 mL of heptane , 0.05 mL of 2-propanol ); detector: UV 200, 254 nm, TC = 0.05 sec. E = 0.1] is >99%.
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer dipping below the surface of the mixture are placed 158 g. (2.8 moles) of acrolein, 500 ml. of absolute ethanol, and 10 g. of ammonium chloride. The material is stirred for 1 hour without external heating; the temperature of the mixture should rise to about 30°. Over a 3-hour period the temperature is raised to 80°, and the mixture is maintained at this temperature for an additional hour. The flask is then cooled, and anhydrous sodium or magnesium sulfate is added as a drying agent.
B. (2S,3S)-3-Acetyl-8-carboethoxy-2,3-dimethyl-1-oxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane. Dry nitromethane (100 mL) is added through a rubber septum by syringe to a vacuum-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask that contains the ketal mixture prepared in Step A (9.00 g, 31.8 mmol) and a magnetic stir bar. The solution is cooled to −23°C, tin(IV) chloride (SnCl4) (11 mL, 94 mmol) is added by syringe and the solution is stirred for 30 min at −23°C. At this time the brown solution is warmed to 23°C and stirring is continued for an additional 30 min. Saturated aqueous NH4Cl (200 mL) is added and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to remove nitromethane. The resulting aqueous suspension is extracted with ethyl acetate (200 mL) and the organic extract is washed with brine (200 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The residue is subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel (250 g, 20 cm × 10 cm) using ethyl acetate:hexane (1:1) eluant to give 8.1 g (90%) of (2S,3S)-3-acetyl-8-carboethoxy-2,3-dimethyl-1-oxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decane as a pale yellow oil and.
In a 3-l. flask provided with a reflux condenser are placed 114 g. (1.0 mole) of ethyl crotonate, 460 ml. of 95% ethanol, and a solution of 54 g. (1.06 moles) of 95% sodium cyanide in 128 ml. of water. The solution is refluxed on a steam bath for 5 hours, during which time some ammonia is evolved and the solution becomes dark yellow. A suspension of 150 g. of barium hydroxide octahydrate in 286 ml. of hot water is added to the solution, and the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure (about 30 mm.) to a volume of about 400 ml. It is again refluxed on the steam bath for 4 hours or until the evolution of ammonia almost ceases. The solution is then concentrated to a thick paste under reduced pressure.
The apparatus consists of a 200-ml. beaker equipped with a magnetic stirrer or any other type suitable for stirring a small volume of liquid. The flask is charged with 20.4 g. (0.10 mole) of iodobenzene2 and is immersed in a water bath maintained at 30°. Thirty-six grams (31 ml., 0.24 mole) of commercial 40% peracetic acid is added dropwise to the well-stirred iodobenzene over a period of 30–40 minutes. Stirring is continued for another 20 minutes at a bath temperature of 30°, during which time a homogeneous yellow solution is formed. Crystallization of iodosobenzene diacetate may begin during this period.
The heavier chlorocyclohexanone layer is separated and combined with three 150-ml. ether extracts of the aqueous phase, and washed with 150 ml. of water and then with 200 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution. After filtration (gravity) through anhydrous sodium sulfate the ether is removed and the residue vacuum-distilled in a modified Claisen flask. The fraction (300–340 g.) boiling below 100° at 10 mm. is collected. This material is then fractionated carefully under reduced pressure by means of a 42-in. modified Vigreux column (heated) with a total-condensation variable take-off head. The yield of 2-chlorocyclohexanone boiling at 90–91°/14–15 mm. is 240–265 g. (61–66%) and.
To the clear solution is gradually added 1 L of ethyl acetate over 1 hr with continual stirring. The product slowly crystallizes during the addition of ethyl acetate. At the end of the addition, the product slurry is cooled to 5°C by immersing the reaction flask in an ice bath. The product is filtered and washed twice with 100 mL of cold ethyl acetate . Upon drying under vacuum at 50°C for 24 hr, 38.6 g of the product is recovered as a white solid (96% yield, mp 128-131°C).
A solution of 450 g. (2 moles) of stannous chloride crystals in 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is placed in a 3-l. beaker provided with an efficient mechanical stirrer and cooled in an ice bath. When the temperature of the solution has fallen to +5°, 100 g. (0.66 mole) of m-nitrobenzaldehyde is added in one portion. The temperature rises slowly at first, reaching 25–30° in about five minutes, then rises very rapidly to about 100°. Stirring must be vigorous or the reaction mixture may be forced out of the beaker. During the reaction the nitrobenzaldehyde dissolves, and an almost clear, red solution is obtained. The solution is cooled in an ice-salt mixture until the temperature has fallen to about +2°. During the cooling, orange-red crystals separate and a pasty suspension results.
The hot mixture is filtered; the aminonaphthoic acid is washed on the Büchner funnel with 400 ml. of hot water and is pressed as dry as possible. The product is dried at 50° to constant weight (24–36 hours). 3-Amino-2-naphthoic acid is a yellow, powdery substance, which melts at 214–215°; the yield is 110–115 g. (66–70%). The quantities of starting materials are limited only by the size of the autoclave available; the yield (per cent) in large runs is the same as that obtained above.
In a 1-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer are placed 500 ml. of glacial acetic acid, 29.0 g. (0.19 mole) of p-aminoacetanilide, 40 g. (0.26 mole) of sodium perborate tetrahydrate, and 10 g. (0.16 mole) of boric acid. The mixture is heated with stirring to 50–60° and held at this temperature for 6 hours. Initially the solids dissolve but, after heating for approximately 40 minutes, the product begins to separate. At the end of the reaction period, the mixture is cooled to room temperature and the yellow product is collected on a Büchner funnel. It is washed with water until the washings are neutral to pH paper and then dried in an oven at 110°. The yield of 4,4'-bis(acetamido)azobenzene, m.p. 288–293° (dec.), is 16.5 g. (57.7%). It is used as such for the hydrolysis step.
The two-phase main fraction of the distillate is placed in a 500-ml. separatory funnel and the lower layer of crude 2-nitroethanol (185–200 g., 146–158 ml., n25D 1.4493–1.4513, containing about 92–94 mole % 2-nitroethanol) is drawn off. The 2-nitroethanol is then extracted in a 500-ml. separatory funnel with an equal volume of light petroleum ether (b.p. 60–68°, such as Skellysolve B) or hexane, and the colorless lower layer of 2-nitroethanol (174–188 g., 46–49%, n25D 1.4432–1.4433, containing about 98 mole % 2-nitroethanol) is drawn off and. The product turns light yellow after standing for a day or more.
After the filtrate has become thoroughly cool, it is acidified with hydrochloric acid, about 1700 cc. of technical concentrated acid being necessary. The precipitated p-chloromercuribenzoic acid is difficult to filter because of its flocculent character. It is best to allow it to stand at least overnight and then filter by suction after siphoning most of the clear supernatant liquid. The acid retains much water and should be dried at 110°. The yield is 350–420 g. (61–74 per cent of the theoretical amount). The crude acid may be purified by reprecipitation with hydrochloric acid from a solution in sodium hydroxide. The crude acid is sufficiently pure for the preparation of p-iodobenzoic acid (p. 325). It can be used for this purpose without drying.
The heterogeneous mixture of the silyl enol ether and triethylamine hydrochloride is transferred to the solution of the Grignard reagent at 0°C by means of a large-bore cannula during 15 min. The efficient transfer of the silyl enol ether is accomplished with the aid of nitrogen pressure. The flask containing the silyl enol ether is rinsed with 50 mL of ether that is transferred to the Grignard solution. Stirring at 0°C is continued for 15 min. The reaction is then quenched by slow addition of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution until the reaction mixture becomes clear. (Caution! The septa are removed from the flask in order to vent the pressure). The solution is allowed to warm to 22°C and the ether layer is decanted from the magnesium salt and the unreacted magnesium. The residue is diluted with 100 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution and extracted with ether (3 × 50 mL). The combined ether extracts are washed with brine (2 × 50 mL), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at reduced pressure. The product that is obtained is used in the next step without purification.
The solution of the Grignard reagent is cooled to about 10°, and to it, while stirring vigorously, is added a solution of 600 g. (4.8 moles) of methyl sulfate in about 500 cc. of dry ether. The reaction is very vigorous, and bumping may occur as the result of the separation of insoluble magnesium compounds. The addition of the methyl sulfate requires two to three hours. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for about twenty-four hours and is then decomposed by adding dilute hydrochloric acid through the separatory funnel. Stirring is started as soon as the mass is fluid enough. When the mixture is decomposed completely, the ether layer is separated and washed three times with water. After the magnesium salts have been removed, the ether layer is evaporated and the residue is added slowly to a solution of 30 g. of sodium in 500 cc. of absolute alcoholx. The mixture is boiled for about one-half hour. Then the solution is cooled, 150–200 cc. of ether is added, and the alkali and alcohol are removed by washing thoroughly with water. Finally the ether solution is dried over calcium chloride, the ether is distilled, and the residue is warmed on a water bath for three to four hours with 25–30 g. of metallic sodium. The mixture is filtered, and the filtrate is fractionated carefully under reduced pressure in a modified Claisen flask. The fractions collected are: up to 85°/18 mm.; 85–87°/18 mm.; and residue. The low-boiling fraction weighs about 50 g. and is mainly mesitylene. The second fraction is isodurene and has a melting point of −24.2°. The yield is 140–160 g. (52–60 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding 138 g. (6.0 g. atoms) of fresh-cut sodium in small pieces to 2.5 l. of absolute ethanol in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient reflux condenser capped with a calcium chloride drying tube. In a three-necked 5-l. round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser capped with a calcium chloride tube, a rubber-sealed mechanical stirrer, and an inlet tube for addition of the sodium ethoxide solution, are mixed 480 g. (3.0 moles) of diethyl malonate and 472 g. (3.0 moles) of trimethylene chlorobromide. The mixture is heated to 80° and vigorously stirred while the sodium ethoxide solution is slowly forced into the flask by means of dry air pressure. The rate of addition is regulated so that the reaction mixture refluxes smoothly. After the addition is complete (this requires about 1.5 hours), the mixture is refluxed, with continued stirring, for an additional 45 minutes. Upon completion of the reflux period, the alcohol is removed by distillation, 90–95% of the alcohol being recovered. The reaction mixture is cooled, and 900 ml. of cold water is added. After the sodium halides are completely dissolved, the organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 500-ml. portions of ether. The organic layer and the ether extracts are combined, shaken with 50 ml. of saturated salt solution, and dried over 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution is filtered, the ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath, and the residue, which weighs 600–625 g., is distilled through a short Vigreux column. The yield of product boiling at 91–96°/4 mm. is 320–330 g. (53–55%).
A. Racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol. A 3-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an addition funnel, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen inlet is charged with 35.3 g (1.47 g-atom) of magnesium turnings and 170 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this stirred mixture a solution of 155 mL (1.47 mol) of bromobenzene in 250 mL of dry THF is added dropwise over a 1.5-hr period and. After the addition of bromobenzene is complete, 1 L of dry THF is added. The solution is cooled to −30°C (dry ice–nitromethane slush bath) and 6.53 g (0.066 mol) of purified copper(I) chloride is added. The resulting mixture is stirred for 10 min, and then a solution of 101 mL (1.0 mol) of cyclohexene oxide in 100 mL of THF is added dropwise over a 1.5-hr period. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to 0°C and stirred for 2 hr, then quenched by adding 500 mL of saturated ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4] solution (aqueous). The layers are separated and the organic layer is washed with 100 mL of saturated (NH4)2SO4. The combined aqueous layers are extracted with ether, the organic layers are combined and dried over anhydrous MgSO4, and the solvent is removed via rotary evaporator to give 175.5 g (99.6% crude) of the desired product as a light-yellow solid. The solid is recrystallized from pentane to give 142.3 g (80%), mp 55.5–57.0°C (lit.3 57–58°C).
The lithium is washed three times by transferring approximately 150-mL portions of anhydrous ethyl ether into the flask through the serum stopper by forced siphon through a stainless-steel cannula, stirring the resulting suspension of lithium briefly, allowing the lithium to rise to the surface, and finally withdrawing the major part of the underlying ether by forced siphon through a cannula. Anhydrous ethyl ether (500 mL) is added to the resultant oil-free lithium. Methyl chloride gas (bp −24°C, d−24°C 0.99 g/mL) from a compressed gas cylinder is passed through a flask containing Linde 4A molecular sieves and into a dry, 100-mL Pyrex graduated cylinder equipped with a 24/40 standard taper joint attached to a Claisen adapter and dry ice condenser, and cooled to −24°C with a bath of dry ice–acetone. When 52.7 mL (52.5 g, 1.04 mol) of liquid methyl chloride has been collected, the adapter and condenser are removed, several boiling chips are added to the cold (−24°C) graduated cylinder, and the cylinder is stoppered with a rubber septum through which is inserted a stainless-steel cannula. The other end of this cannula is inserted through the rubber septum of the flask so that its tip is just above the liquid surface of the reaction flask. Dry ice–acetone is then added to the condenser attached to the reaction flask. Vigorous stirring of the ethereal lithium dispersion is begun and the methyl chloride is added over approximately a 1.5-hr period. The rate at which methyl chlorideis distilled into the reaction vessel is controlled by slight cooling or warming of the graduated cylinder that contains the liquid methyl chloride. During addition, the initial grey suspension changes to a brown to purple suspension; by the end of the addition, little, if any, lithium metal should be seen floating on the surface of the ether solution when stirring is interrupted. After the addition of methyl chloride is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 25°C for an additional 0.5–1 hr and then allowed to stand overnight or longer at 25°C under a static argon atmosphere, whereupon the precipitated lithium chloride settles to the bottom of the flask. The dry ice condenser and thermometer are removed from the flask and replaced with rubber septa. The supernatant methyllithium solution is transferred by forced siphon using a large-gauge cannula through a glass wool pad into a receiving flask previously flushed with an inert gas. The receiving flask, which contains the filtrate, a pale-yellow solution of methyllithium, is removed and stored in a refrigerator for 12–24 hr during, which time an additional small quantity of lithium chloride separates as fine crystals. The resulting supernatant solution is transferred with a stainless-steel cannula and a slight positive pressure of argon or nitrogen into one or more suitable oven-dried, nitrogen-filled storage bottles capped with rubber septa. Two 1-mL aliquots of the solution are removed with a hypodermic syringe for a modified Gilman titration and a 5-mL aliquot is removed with a hypodermic syringe to determine the halide concentration. The solution contains 1.40–1.77 M methyllithium accompanied by 0.07–0.09 M lithium chloride corresponding to a 70–89% yield of methyllithium. If this solution is protected from oxygen and moisture, it may be stored at 0–25°C for several months (and remain active).
Recrystallization is unnecessary since the product is pure white and free from tarry material.
A hot solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared, in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, from 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of sodium and 1.6 l. of absolute ethanol. With shaking, a solution of 139 g. (2 moles) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 100 ml. of hot water is added. The resulting suspension is cooled quickly by placing the flask in an ice-water mixture and is then filtered with suction through a Büchner funnel. The residue of sodium chloride is washed with small portions (total 200 ml.) of absolute ethanol. The filtrate is returned to the 3-l. flask, and to it is added 148 g. (1 mole) of cinnamic acid, whereupon a voluminous precipitate forms. The mixture is refluxed on a steam bath for 9 hours. The amino acid begins to separate after 5–6 hours; the suspended solid causes the mixture to bump. The suspension is allowed to remain overnight at room temperature, and the crystals are then collected on a Büchner funnel. The product is washed with 300 ml. of absolute ethanol, then with some ice-cold water to remove all the sodium chloride, and finally with 300 ml. of absolute ethanol, always in small portions. The colorless crystals of amino acid are dried in a vacuum desiccator over flake sodium hydroxide. The yield is 56 g. (34%).
For synthetic purposes the BTMSPO obtained can be used without further purification; on the other hand, distillation (40°C/30 mm) or column chromatography (Florisil–eluent pentane) does not seem to improve the grade of purity. The compound can be stored under nitrogen in a refrigerator for months without any appreciable decomposition.
Forty-three grams (0.25 mole) of p-bromoaniline and 20 cc. of water are warmed in a 400-cc. beaker until the bromoaniline melts, and then 50 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added with mechanical stirring. The mixture is heated and stirred until solution is practically complete. The beaker is then set in a dish of ice water and the solution is stirred as it cools in order to precipitate the p-bromoaniline hydrochloride in fine crystals. A few small pieces of ice are added, and the cold (about 0–5°) suspension is diazotized with a solution of 18 g. (0.26 mole) of sodium nitrite in 36 cc. of water to an end-point with starch-iodide paper.
Removal of 100 ml. of chloroform from the above filtrate by means of evaporation under reduced pressure at room temperature and subsequent cooling permits isolation of an additional 2 g. of cyanogen iodide; m.p. 146–147°. The total yield thus becomes 47 g. (62% based on iodine).
The ether is distilled from the combined extracts, and the crude triethyl carbinol is dried with 10 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The alcohol is then distilled at atmospheric pressure, and the portion (80–90 g.) boiling at 139–142° is collected. The low-boiling distillate is treated with 5 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and redistilled, whereby another portion (about 25 g.) of triethyl carbinol boiling at 139–142° is obtained. The process is repeated once, or twice if necessary, and an additional 20 g. is collected. The total yield is 125–135 g. (82–88 per cent of the theoretical amount). Triethyl carbinol is a viscous liquid with a penetrating, camphor-like odor.
A. 11-Oxatricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undeca-3,8-diene. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 66.1 g. (0.501 mole) of 1,4,5,8-tetrahydronaphthalene [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 731 (1988)] and 200 ml. of anhydrous dichloromethane. To the resulting solution is added 75 g. of anhydrous sodium acetate. After the suspension is cooled with an ice bath, 104.5 g. (0.55 mole) of commercial 40% peracetic acid and is added dropwise over a period of 20–30 minutes, while maintaining the temperature at approximately 15° and stirring vigorously. To the reaction mixture is added, without delay, 500 ml. of water, to dissolve the sodium acetate and extract the bulk of the acetic acid. The organic layer is washed successively with two 100-ml. portions of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and two 100-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, leaving a solid residue. Two recrystallizations from approximately 50 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°), cooling the solution to −40°, yields 58.5–62.0 g. (79–84%) of 11-oxatricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undeca-3,8-diene as white needles, m.p. 58–61°.
The oily, upper layer is dried with 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and is distilled under diminished pressure. For this purpose an efficient fractionating column is used. The portion boiling below 70° at 15 mm. is mainly methoxyacetonitrile and weighs 60–70 g. The upper layer from the second methylation is treated in a similar manner; the distillate weighs 55–60 g. The residue in the distilling flask is methyl sulfate and is used in a subsequent run.
B. Propiolaldehyde diethyl acetal. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a double-walled condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 100 g. (0.295 mole) of tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate and 20 ml. of water. The mixture is stirred, forming a thick paste to which a solution of 29 g. (0.10 mole) of 2,3-dibromopropionaldehyde diethyl acetal in 75 ml. of pentane is added. The resulting mixture is stirred rapidly and cooled to 10–15° as a cold (10–15°) solution of 60 g. (1.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 60 ml. of water is added over 10 minutes. About 5 minutes later the pentane begins to boil and continues to reflux for another 10–20 minutes. The mixture is stirred for 2 hours at room temperature, cooled to 5°, and made slightly acidic by adding ca. 120 ml. of cold (ca. 5°) 25% sulfuric acid. Stirring is stopped, the layers are allowed to separate for 30 minutes, and the upper organic layer is carefully decanted. The lower, aqueous layer is filtered, removing sodium sulfate, extracted with three 50-ml. portions of pentane, and, if desired, processed to recover the tetrabutylammonium salt. The pentane solutions are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated. The colorless concentrate is distilled, giving 7.8–8.6 g. (61–67%) of propiolaldehyde diethyl acetal as a colorless liquid, b.p. 138–139° (760 mm.), 95–96° (170 mm.).
After the ice has melted, the product is filtered by suction and the somewhat sticky mass pressed as dry as possible. It is transferred to a mortar and triturated with three successive 300-cc. portions of cold water (to remove acid); it is then stirred to a mush with two successive 25-cc. portions of ice-cold ethyl alcohol (to remove adhering oil); the solid is pressed dry on the suction filter after each of the five washings. The product is pressed on a porous plate and, when fairly dry (about one hour), is dissolved in 100–120 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol. The dark solution is filtered quickly through a small suction funnel, and the hot filtrate is poured slowly into 1 l. of cold water which is stirred vigorously with a stirring rod during the addition and for several minutes afterward. After standing a few minutes the yellow solid is filtered by suction, washed with 200 cc. of cold water, sucked dry, and pressed out on a porous clay plate.
The dark green reaction mixture is stirred vigorously for 3 hours and then is treated carefully with 96 g. (1.2 moles) of solid ammonium nitrate. All the fittings are removed from the flask, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. Water (300 ml.) is added cautiously to the residue. (Caution! Traces of undecomposed sodium amide may adhere to the upper walls of the flask.) The organic layer is taken up in two 160-ml. portions of chloroform, and the solutions are combined and washed twice with 100 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid and once with 100 ml. of water. (Caution! The extraction procedure and subsequent chloroform distillation should be conducted in a hood because some hydrogen cyanide is usually evolved.) The chloroform solution is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the chloroform is removed by distillation. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through an insulated, 5-in. Vigreux column. The forerun, b.p. 95–100° (3 mm.), weighs ca. 1 g.; the product boils at 100–101° (3 mm.); n25D 1.5451. The yield of 1-cyanobenzocyclobutene is 33–34 g. (64–66%) and.
C. trans-3-Methyl-2-vinylcyclohexanone (4). Compound 3 (31.5 g) and 25 mL of acetonitrile (0.47 mol, 6-fold excess) are placed in a 100-mL round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated to reflux for 2 hr under nitrogen, cooled to room temperature, and slowly added to 300 mL of diethyl ether. The acetonitrile complex 5 precipitates as a bright yellow solid, and may be removed by suction filtration.
The autoclave is pressured with ethylene to 400 lb./in.2 with stirring. It is then heated to 100° with stirring, which causes the pressure to rise to about 555 lb./in.2. It is maintained at 100° with stirring until a gradual drop in pressure ceases; this usually takes about 2.5 hours, but it may take as long as 10 hours. The autoclave is cooled to room temperature, and the excess ethylene is vented. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, the autoclave is rinsed with 100 ml. of methanol that is added to the flask, and the mixture is fractionated through a 90-cm. column packed with glass helices. After a fore-cut of 50–100 g. distilling at 55–129°, 434–468 g. (77–83%) of N-ethylpiperidine is collected; b.p. 129–130.5°; nD20 1.443–1.444.
The flask is then allowed to cool to 100°, and 800 cc. of hot water is added with vigorous shaking. The hot mixture is transferred to a 5-l. separatory funnel, the flask being rinsed with 200 cc. of hot water. The mixture is shaken well and the layers separated. The isoamyl alcohol layer is extracted with four or five 200-cc. portions of nearly boiling water. The combined aqueous extracts are then steam-distilled in order to remove any isoamyl alcohol from the aqueous solution of the sodium salt. About 500 cc. of distillate is collected.
An autoclave is charged successively with 600 ml. (9.5 moles) of approximately 28% aqueous ammonia, 78 g. of zinc chloride (0.57 mole) and, and 167 g. of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (0.89 mole). The autoclave is closed, and then, with continuous stirring or shaking, it is gradually heated, so that, at the end of 3 hours, the temperature is 195°. This temperature is maintained for 36 hours; the pressure is about 400 lb.. The autoclave is allowed to cool to room temperature, with continuous stirring or shaking. The cover is removed, the solid is scraped off the walls, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 5-l. flask. The autoclave is rinsed with two 700-ml. portions of water, which are added to the reaction mixture.
In a 1500-cc. bottle are placed 100 g. (1 mole) of pinacolone (p. 462), 120 g. (1.13 moles) of freshly distilled benzaldehyde, 380 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, 130 cc. of water, and 100 cc. of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution. The bottle is stoppered tightly, placed on a shaking machine, and agitated vigorously for about thirty-two hours.
The oil is immediately dissolved in 200 mL of dry benzene and transferred to a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask to which is added 7.73 g (0.051 mol) of 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, DBU. The flask is fitted with a condenser, heated at reflux for 8 hr, allowed to cool to room temperature, and washed with 200 mL of water and 200 mL of brine . The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated to leave a dark brown oil. This material is chromatographed on silica gel (elution with 30% ethyl acetate in hexanes) and to give 7.02 g (79.9% for the two steps) as a very pale yellow oil.
A. (−)-(S,S)-N,N'-Bis(1-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpropyl)-2,2-dimethyl-malonamide (3): An oven-dried 250 mL, 3-necked round-bottom flask equipped with a stirring bar and two 50 mL pressure-equalizing addition funnels connected to a mineral oil bubbler is purged with nitrogen and charged with (L)-valinol (2, 5.13 g, 0.050 mol, Note 1). The flask is immersed in an ice bath at 0 °C and triethylamine (17.4 mL, 0.124 mol, Note 2) is added dropwise via the first addition funnel. 2,2-Dimethylpropanedioyl dichloride (3.3 mL, 0.25 mol, Note 3) in dry dichloromethane (25 mL, Note 4) is then added dropwise over 25 minutes via the second addition funnel. The internal temperature increases from 0 °C to 10 °C during the addition. Subsequently, the ice bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. Stirring is continued for 45 min, resulting in a colorless precipitate that is dissolved by addition of dry dichloromethane (120 mL). After addition of aqueous HCl (1 N, 30 mL), the aqueous layer is separated and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 15 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated NaHCO3 solution (30 mL) and brine (30 mL), dried over MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo to afford crude 3 as a pale yellow solid. Recrystallization of the crude product from ethyl acetate (40 mL) yields 3 (4.30 g, 14.2 mmol, 57%) as white crystals. The mother liquor is concentrated and the residue recrystallized from ethyl acetate (10 mL) to yield a second crop of 3 (1.60 g, 5.27 mmol, 21%); the process is repeated to yield a third crop of 3 (0.440 g, 1.45 mmol, 6%, total yield: 6.40 g, 21.1 mmol, 84%, Note 5).
A solution of 50 g. (1.25 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 1.5 l. of water is prepared in a 5-l. flask, and the solution is heated to gentle boiling. To the hot solution is added, in small quantities, 330 g. (0.9 mole) of anhydro-2-hydroxymercuri-3-nitrobenzoic acid (p. 56). The mixture is stirred after the addition of each portion of about 50 g. until the material has gone into solution except for a small residue. The flask is then fitted with a stirrer and addition tube and with a connection to a reflux condenser. The material is heated to boiling and stirred vigorously. There is slowly added, with continuous stirring, 101 g. (85 cc., 0.95 mole) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). Heating is discontinued at this point, and 31.5 g. (30 cc., 0.5 mole) of glacial acetic acid (sp. gr. 1.05) is added slowly. A curdy precipitate forms.
3-(1-Octen-1-yl)cyclopentanone.3 A 38.7-g quantity (0.150 mol) of chlorobis(η5-cyclopentadienyl)hydridozirconium, Schwartz's reagent, is weighed into an oven-dried, 250-mL, three-necked flask. The flask, equipped with argon inlet and exit tubes, a thermometer and magnetic stirrer, is placed in an ice/water cooling bath. Under an atmosphere of argon, 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran and 23.6 mL (0.16 mol) of freshly distilled 1-octyne are added. The ice/water cooling bath is used to keep the temperature between 15°C and 25°C during the addition. Stirring is continued in the ice bath for 2 hr to control a mildly exothermic reaction; then the flask is wrapped in aluminum foil and stirred overnight at room temperature (elapsed time is 18 hr). At this point, 10.9 mL (0.130 mol) of freshly distilled 2-cyclopentenone is added and the reaction mixture is chilled in an ice bath for 10 min. To the cooled reaction mixture a total of 3.34 g (0.0130 mol) of vacuum-sublimed (at 180°C), powdered, solid nickel acetylacetonate,(Note 4) is added in three portions at 10-min intervals, keeping the temperature of the reaction mixture below 50°C,(Note 6).
A. 2,2-Dimethyl-4-pentenal. In a 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask that contains a magnetic stirring bar are placed 108 g (1.5 mol) of isobutyraldehyde, 58 g (1.0 mol) of allyl alcohol, 230 mL of p-cymene, and 0.4 g (2 mmol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. The mixture is heated with a mantle with stirring for 32 hr under a 50-cm fractionating column packed with 6-mm glass beads and topped by a Dean-Stark trap. The reaction mixture is then distilled through the packed column. The fraction that boils at 120–126°C is collected. The yield is 86.0–87.3 g (77–78%) of 2,2-dimethyl-4-pentenal (1) as a clear, colorless oil, nD25 1.4216.
The dried crude material is distilled, b.p. 125–127° (13 mm.), n25D 1.5030, yield 105 g. (55%).
The stopper is removed from the reaction flask, and the solution of ammonium p-aminophenylacetate gently boiled under the hood until nearly all the excess hydrogen sulfide and ammonia have escaped. The solution changes from a dark orange-red to a pale yellow. The deposited sulfur is filtered off by suction, and 40 cc. of glacial acetic acid rapidly stirred into the hot filtrate. The p-aminophenylacetic acid which crystallizes out weighs 69–70 g., but it is contaminated with a small amount of free sulfur. On evaporating the mother liquor to a small volume, about 5 g. more can be obtained. The crude material is recrystallized from 4 l. of distilled water, 69–70 g. (83–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which melts at 199–200° being thus obtained.
The reaction mixture is poured into a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with four 200-mL portions of methylene chloride. The extracts (the lower phase) are combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate containing a small amount of anhydrous potassium carbonate (to remove traces of hydrochloric acid), and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated by distillation through a vacuum-insulated silvered column (20-cm length, 1-cm i.d.) packed with glass helices (size 2.3 mm, Lab Glass, Inc.) and equipped with an adjustable stillhead, until the pot temperature rises to 80°C. The crude product is then transferred to a 100-mL flask and distilled through the same column (reflux ratio 10:1) to give 14–16 g (0.20–0.23 mol), 31–35% overall yield (based on pure cyclopropyl carbinol) of cyclobutanone, bp 98–99°C, d254 0.926, n25D 1.4190. The product is sufficiently pure (98–99%) for most purposes,,, and.
A. 1,1-Cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid. In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, carrying a separatory funnel, a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride tube, and a thermometer, are placed 160 g. (1 mole) of ethyl malonate and 212 g. (1.05 moles) of trimethylene bromide. The thermometer is adjusted so that the bulb is immersed in the liquid in the flask; the stirrer is started, and a solution of 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of sodium in 800 ml. of absolute ethanol is added through the separatory funnel while the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at 60–65°. During the addition of the first quarter of the ethoxide solution (20 minutes) it is necessary to cool the reaction mixture occasionally in order to maintain the proper temperature, but after this point the remainder of the ethoxide solution is added just rapidly enough to keep the reaction mixture at 60–65°; this part of the addition requires about 30 minutes.
The solid residue is finely crushed and warmed nearly to boiling with 500 cc. of toluene; the mixture is then poured into the folded filter paper of an extraction apparatus (p. 375) and extracted with boiling toluene for five hours. The toluene is allowed to cool and is decanted from the catechol, which crystallizes out. The insoluble material is again ground up and extracted in the apparatus with the decanted toluene. The combined product, weighing 70–76 g., consists of light brown plates melting at 104°, and is thus pure enough for many purposes. A further 6–12 g. of catechol can be obtained on distilling off the bulk of the toluene from the mother liquor. In order to obtain an entirely pure product, the crude catechol should be distilled under reduced pressure, when it passes over entirely at 119–121° /10 mm. (or 113–115° /8 mm.), and the distillate recrystallized from about five times its weight of toluene. In this way, colorless plates melting at 104–105° are obtained. The yield of the purified product is 76–80 g. (69–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After a few drops of fore-run, practically all the liquid distils at 64–65°/12 mm. The yield of cycloheptanone is 18.5–20.2 g. (33–36%).
The two-phase mixture is placed in a separatory funnel, and the heavy red-brown oil is separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with 100 ml. of ether. The oil and the ether extract are combined, washed with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride, and dried over potassium carbonate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is distilled. Colorless 2-bromoallylamine is collected at 65–68°/100 mm.; weight 49–59 g. (59–72%); nD25 1.5075–1.5085.
8. The authors report that they obtained a crystalline mass after stirring overnight.
B. 2,5-Heptanedione. Methanolic sodium methoxide is prepared by cautiously adding small pieces of freshly cut sodium (5.67 g., 0.247 g.-atom) to 200 ml. of cold methanol in a 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 50-ml. addition funnel, and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube. The resulting solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 38.6 g. (0.243 mole) of 5-nitroheptan-2-one is added over 15 minutes, after which stirring is continued for another 15 minutes at 0°. The ice bath is then replaced with an acetone–dry ice bath, the nitrogen-inlet tube and addition funnel are removed, and a fritted-glass dispersion tube is inserted into the solution. With continued cooling and vigorous stirring, an ozone–oxygen mixture is bubbled through the solution for 5 hours and.
A. 4-Methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin (I). In a 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer reaching to the bottom, and a dropping funnel, is placed 2 l. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84). The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, and when the temperature falls below 10° a solution of 220 g. (2 moles) of resorcinol in 260 g. (2 moles) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate is added dropwise. The mixture is stirred, and the temperature is kept below 10° by means of ice and salt. After all the solution has been added (about 2 hours) the reaction mixture is set aside for 12–24 hours without further cooling. The reaction mixture is now poured with vigorous stirring into a mixture of 4 kg. of ice and 6 l. of water. The precipitate is collected on a filter and washed with three 50-ml. portions of cold water. The crude product is then dissolved in 3 l. of 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, the solution is filtered, and the substituted coumarin is reprecipitated from the filtrate by the slow addition of dilute (1:10) sulfuric acid until the solution is acid to litmus. About 1.1 l. of dilute sulfuric acid is required. During the neutralization, the reaction mixture must be well stirred. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with four 50-ml. portions of cold water, and dried. The yield of 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin is 290–320 g. (82–90%). It is sufficiently pure for use in the next step but may be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol using about 15 ml. of ethanol for 5 g. of product. The recrystallized material forms stout almost colorless needles melting at 185°.
A mixture of 28 g. (0.2 mole) of o-nitrophenol, 30 g. (0.22 mole) of n-butyl bromide, 28 g. (0.2 mole) of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 200 ml. of dry acetone in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask is refluxed on a steam bath for 48 hours. At the end of this time the acetone is distilled from the mixture, 200 ml. of water is added to the residue, and the product is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed with three 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide, the benzene is removed by distillation at ordinary pressure, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 118–121°/1 mm. is 29–31 g. (75–80%) and.
A. 5-Nitroheptan-2-one. A 500-ml., three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 50-ml. addition funnel, and a condenser fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 36.0 g. (35.7 ml., 0.414 mole) of 1-nitropropane, 14.4 g. (20.0 ml., 0.142 mole) of diisopropylamine, and 200 ml. of chloroform. The resulting solution is stirred and heated to 60°, and 28 g. (0.40 mole) of methyl vinyl ketone is added dropwise over a 2-hour period. The reaction mixture is then stirred for another 16 hours at 60°, allowed to cool to room temperature, and transferred to a 500-ml. separatory funnel, where it is washed with two 30-ml. portions of water and 30 ml. of 5% hydrochloric acid. After drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate, the chloroform solution is concentrated with a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure gives 39.1 g. (61%) of 5-nitroheptan-2-one, b.p. 65–70° (0.2 mm.), nD20 1.4403.
B. (R,R)-( + )-2,3-Dimethoxy-N,N,N',N'-tetramethylsuccinic acid diamide. Into a 4-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and stopper, are introduced 240 mL of 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide (3 mol), 1.5 L of methylene chloride, 0.2 g of benzyltriethylammonium chloride (TEBA), and then 260 g (2.06 mol) of dimethyl sulfate. The mixture is stirred vigorously, and a total of 204 g (1 mol) of the powdered tartaric acid diamide is added in portions at such a rate as to maintain refluxing. Stirring is continued for 24 hr without heating, whereupon 1 L of water is added. Separation of the organic phase, extraction of the aqueous layer with three 300-mL portions of methylene chloride, drying of the combined organic solutions over sodium sulfate, and removal of the solvent in a rotary evaporator (bath temperature below 80°C, water aspirator vacuum) furnishes a slightly yellow oil that crystallizes at 25°C and is sufficiently pure for use in the following reduction step. Recrystallization from cyclohexane/benzene yields 220 g (95%,) of colorless prisms, mp 63.2–63.5°C, [α]D + 116° (benzene, c 3).
D. N-Boc-L-allylglycine . A 1-L, single-neck, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient reflux condenser, a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a heating mantle is charged with 14.7 g (0.056 mol, 1 equiv) of pseudoephedrine L-allylglycinamide and 224 mL (0.112 mol, 2 equiv) of 0.5 M aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting slurry is heated to reflux whereupon a clear, colorless homogeneous solution is obtained. After 2 hr at reflux, the reaction mixture is cooled to 23°C, inducing the crystallization of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine. The reaction suspension is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted sequentially with one 200-mL and one 100-mL portion of dichloromethane , reserving the aqueous layer. The two organic layers are individually and sequentially extracted with a single 150-mL portion of water. The aqueous layer is combined with the earlier aqueous extract and the resulting solution is reserved. If desired, (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine can be recovered from the organic extracts, as follows. The organic extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a solid. The solid is recrystallized by dissolving it in a minimum volume of hot water (ca. 250 mL). The resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly to 23°C, by which time extensive crystallization of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine has occurred. The recrystallization flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice bath. After standing at 0°C for 1 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and are dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to afford 6.2 g (67%) of pure (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine (mp 116-117°C). The mother liquors are concentrated and a second crop of crystals (1.5 g, total yield 7.7 g, 83%) is obtained in a similar manner by recrystallization from ca. 50 mL of water.
About 200 g. of solid sodium chloride is added to the flask, and the butyl alcohol is removed by steam distillation. The alcohol layer is separated while still hot, transferred to a 1-l. beaker, and heated on a hot plate with stirring until the temperature reaches about 160°. By this time all the water is removed and foaming has stopped. The hot liquid is transferred to a 1-l. Claisen flask having a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and distilled at 3 mm. After a small fore-run of 5–10 g., the main fraction boils at 177–183°/3 mm. and amounts to 330–340 g. (82–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, provided with a short reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a separatory funnel, is placed a solution of 636 g. (5.3 moles) of mesitylene in 375–440 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The flask is placed in an ice-salt bath, and when the temperature of the reaction mixture is below 10° a solution of 900 g. (288 cc., 5.6 moles) of bromine in 565 cc. of carbon tetrachloride is added to the well-stirred solution. The bromination proceeds very readily, and the hydrogen bromide which is evolved is led off through the condenser and absorbed in water. The addition of the bromine solution requires about three hours, during which time the temperature is maintained at 10–15°.
C. 3,7-Dimethyl-1,6-octadien-3-amine (3). A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a condenser, and a nitrogen inlet tube is charged with 9.0 g. (0.030 mole) of octadiene 2, 160 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 150 ml. of aqueous 6 N sodium hydroxide. The air is replaced with nitrogen, and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 40 hours. Ether (300 ml.) is added, the organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is washed twice with 50 ml. of ether. After drying over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtration, the organic extracts are concentrated with a rotary evaporator, affording a white, semisolid residue, which is extracted four times with 50 ml. of boiling hexane. The extract is concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and the residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure using a short-path apparatus, yielding 2.99–3.45 g. (65–75%) of amine 3, b.p. 58–61° (2.6 mm.) and.
To 3600 g. (1960 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, in a 5-l. flask placed in an empty water bath, is added 360 g. (1.6 moles) of technical trinitrotoluene, while the mixture is stirred mechanically. Sodium dichromate is now added in small quantities, with constant stirring, until the temperature of the mixture reaches 40°; the empty water bath is now filled with cold water and the addition of sodium dichromate continued at such a rate that the temperature remains at 45–55°. In all, 540 g. (1.8 moles) of sodium dichromate is added, the addition taking one to two hours. When all has been added, the mixture, which has now become very thick, is stirred for two hours at 45–55°, and poured into a crock containing 4 kg. of crushed ice. The insoluble trinitrobenzoic acid is filtered off and carefully washed with cold water until free from chromium salts. On drying it weighs 320–340 g.
D. Bis(3-methyl-2-butyl)borane (disiamylborane).2 A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask is equipped as described in Section A. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and the flask is charged with 92 ml. (0.11 mole) of a 1.2 M solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran. The flask is cooled with an ice bath before a solution of 15.4 g. (0.220 mole) of 2-methyl-2-butene in 40 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran is added to the stirred solution over a 30-minute period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is kept below ca. 10° for 2 hours. The resulting solution is used directly in the next step.
In a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, provided with an efficient reflux condenser bearing an outlet tube held above a surface of water, a 100-cc. separatory funnel, and a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, is placed 270 g. (2.2 moles) of freshly distilled dry nitrobenzene. The joints in the apparatus are made of asbestos paper covered with water glass (see Note 5, p. 19). The flask is heated in an oil bath maintained at 135–145°, and 26 g. of iron powder and 562 g. (180 cc., 3.5 moles) of dry bromine are added in the following manner: Eight grams of iron powder ("ferrum reductum") is added through the side neck to the stirred nitrobenzene. From the separatory funnel 60 cc. of bromine is added at such a rate that the bromine vapors do not traverse the condenser. This addition requires about one hour, and the mixture is stirred and heated for another hour before the addition of a second portion of iron and bromine. Two portions, each of 8 g. of iron powder and 60 cc. of bromine, are added under the same conditions as the first addition, and the mixture is stirred and heated for one hour between the completion of one addition and the beginning of another. The evolution of hydrogen bromide slackens considerably toward the last of the heating, and there is practically no more bromine vapor in the condenser. A final addition of 2 g. of iron powder is made, and the heating continued for one hour longer.
After 30 minutes the solid sulfinic acid is separated on a fritted-glass filter. The sulfinic acid is dissolved from the filter by a mixture of 750 ml. of ether and 750 ml. of methylene chloride. The solution is dried over calcium chloride and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure (bath temperature 25°). The residue is suspended in 50 ml. of water, and small portions of dilute ammonia are added to the well-stirred suspension until it has a pH of 9. Insoluble impurities are separated by filtration, and 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is precipitated from the filtrate by adding 5-ml. portions of 6N hydrochloric acid with cooling; the sulfinic acid precipitated by each portion of acid is separately collected on a Buchner funnel. The acid, a pale yellow solid, is dried on a clay plate in a vacuum desiccator over potassium hydroxide pellets, m.p. 120–125° (dec.), weight 9.4–14.9 g. (50–80%). If the 2-nitrobenzenesulfinic acid is to be used for the hydrogenation of the next step high purity is required, and it is generally advisable to reprecipitate the acid once more in the same way.
A 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with stirrer, condenser, dropping funnel, and an arrangement for maintenance of an inert atmosphere, is charged with a mixture of 300 g. (3.26 moles) of norbornadiene and 0.650 g. (4.53 mmoles) of cuprous bromide in 500 ml. of benzene. Dry nitrogen is introduced continuously, and, after the flask contents are brought to reflux, 245 g. (1.26 mole) of t-butyl perbenzoate, dissolved in 100 ml. of benzene, is added over approximately 1 hour to the stirred mixture. The solution immediately becomes blue or blue-green. The modest heat of reaction requires the application of some heat throughout the reaction period in order to maintain reflux. After the addition is completed, the solution is heated at the reflux temperature for an additional 30 minutes (Caution!).
A mixture of 250 g. (1.46 moles) of p-nitrobenzyl chloride, 225 g. (2.74 moles) of fused sodium acetate, and 375 g. (6.25 moles) of glacial acetic acid is refluxed for 8–10 hours in a 2-l. flask heated by an oil bath, the temperature of which is maintained at 160–170°. After this time the bath is allowed to cool to about 125°, and the acetic acid is removed by distillation under reduced pressure. Care must be taken not to reduce the pressure too rapidly in the early stages of the distillation. As the distillation slows down, the pressure is further reduced until it reaches 50 mm. or lower, and the temperature is slowly raised to 160°. From 2.5 to 3 hours is required for the complete removal of the acetic acid. About 500 ml. of water is added, and the hard cake is broken up with a stirring rod.
A. (2,2-Dimethyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methyl 5-Hexenoate (2). A flame-dried, 250-mL, three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm) and three rubber septa is charged via plastic syringe with 5-hexenoic acid (5.30 mL, 5.09 g, 44.6 mmol), dichloromethane (70 mL), and DL-1,2-isopropylideneglycerol (5.60 mL, 5.95 g, 45.0 mmol, 1.01 equiv). A septum is removed, solid 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (55 mg, 0.45 mmol, 0.01 equiv) is added through the open neck, the septum is replaced, and the flask is evacuated (<1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen before a septum is quickly replaced with a thermometer inlet adapter containing a low temperature thermometer. The flask is submersed in an ice/water bath, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir gently until its temperature reaches 3-4 &Degree;C. Concurrently, a flame-dried, 100-mL recovery flask is charged with N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (9.28 g, 45.0 mmol, 1.01 equiv). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum, evacuated (<1 mmHg) and refilled with nitrogen, then charged with dichloromethane (15 mL) using a 20-mL plastic syringe, and swirled gently to dissolve the solid. The resulting solution is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred reaction mixture using a 20-mL plastic syringe. A white precipitate appears about 5 min into the addition. At no point does the internal temperature rise above 6 &Degree;C. To achieve quantitative transfer, the recovery flask is rinsed with approximately 5 mL dichloromethane, and the resulting solution is added to the reaction mixture in one portion via a 20-mL plastic syringe. Upon completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 5 min before the cold bath is removed. After 3.5 h, the precipitate is removed via vacuum filtration (150 mmHg) through a Büchner funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with an additional 50 mL of dichloromethane, which is poured into the Büchner funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (<30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give a clear, colorless oil that contains a small amount of white solid. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give 9.25 g (91%) of ester 2 as a clear, colorless oil.
A solution of 107 g. (1 mole) of p-toluidine in 700 ml. of chlorobenzene is prepared in a 3-l. three-necked, round-bottom flask fitted with a stirrer, reflux condenser, thermometer, and dropping funnel. Over a period of 5 minutes, 54 g. (29.3 ml., 0.55 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid is added dropwise. To the finely divided suspension of p-toluidine sulfate is added 90 g. (1.1 moles) of sodium thiocyanate, and the mixture is heated for 3 hours at 100° (inside temperature) in an oil bath. The solution, which now contains the thiourea, is cooled to 30°, and 180 g. (108 ml., 1.34 moles) of sulfuryl chloride is added over a period of 15 minutes, with care that the temperature does not exceed 50°. The mixture is kept at 50° for 2 hours (no further evolution of hydrogen chloride), after which the chlorobenzene is removed by filtration.
The reduction is carried out in four cells of the type shown in Fig. 2. Each cell consists of a 1-l. beaker (B), a porous cup (P), a mechanical stirrer, and sheet lead electrodes (E1 and E2) each having a total surface area of 100 sq. cm.. In the cathode space of each cell are placed 25 g. (0.18 mole) of anthranilic acid and 400 ml. of 15% sulfuric acid. In each porous cup is placed 200 ml. of 15% sulfuric acid. The cells are connected in series as shown in Fig. 5 with an ammeter (A) and suitable resistance (R) also in the circuit.
B. 4,4-Dimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A 3-L, round-bottomed flask, containing a solution of 600 mL of aqueous 5% potassium hydroxide, 300 mL of tetrahydrofuran, 1350 mL of ethyl ether, and 165.1 g (1.29 mol) 2,2-dimethyl-4-oxopentanal, is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser. The solution is heated under reflux for 66 hr under a nitrogen atmosphere. On completion, the organic layer is washed 3 times with 200 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium sulfate. The aqueous layer is extracted 3 times with 200 mL of anhydrous ethyl ether. The resulting organic layers are washed 3 times with saturated sodium chloride solution and dried over sodium sulfate. All organic layers are evaporated using aspirator vacuum and a rotary evaporator and combined. The residual ether is removed under reduced pressure to yield 89.7 g (63%) of 4,4-dimethyl-2-cyclopenten-1-one, bp 32°C (0.3 mm),(Note 6),(Note 7).
A. 3.7-Dithianonane-1,9-diol.2 A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser attached to a nitrogen inlet, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 250 mL of absolute ethanol. The ethanol is stirred and 5.75 g (0.25 mol) of sodium metal is cautiously added. After the sodium dissolves, the solution is warmed to 45–50°C and 13.5 g (0.125 mol) of 1,3-propanedithiol is added dropwise over a period of 15 min. To the resulting solution is added dropwise 20.1 g (0.25 mol) of 2-chloroethanol and the mixture is refluxed for 3–4 hr. The mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature and is filtered. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a viscous liquid, which is distilled to give 17.3–20.0 g (71–82%) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-diol, bp 200°C (1.5 mm).
C. 3-[(1S)-1,2-Dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine. A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a rubber septum. The flask is charged with dihydroquinidine 9-O-(9'-phenanthryl) ether and, [0.75 g, (1.5 mmol, 1 mol%, 0.0057 M in the organic phase)], 148.2 g (0.45 mol) of potassium ferricyanide, 62.2 g (0.45 mol) of potassium carbonate, 264 mL of tert-butyl alcohol (tert-BuOH), and 264 mL of distilled water. Mechanical stirring is initiated, 0.11 g (0.3 mmol, 0.2 mol%) of potassium osmate (VI) dihydrate, which generates a 0.0011 M solution of OsO4 in the organic phase, is added, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 0.5 hr, resulting in an orange suspension. The flask is immersed in a 0°C cooling bath, and the mixture stirred for 1 hr. Over a period of 24 hr at 0°C, 26.25 g (0.16 mol) of 3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine is added dropwise via syringe, and the reaction mixture is stirred an additional 24 hr at 0°C. After the required time period has elapsed, 30.25 g (0.24 mol) of solid sodium sulfite (Na2SO3) is added in portions, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature, poured into a 3-L beaker, and allowed to stand for another 1 hr at room temperature. After the organic phase is decanted, the aqueous phase is diluted with 300 mL of water to dissolve the salts, and poured into a 2-L separatory funnel using 90 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) to rinse the flask and beaker. The aqueous phase is extracted three times with 150 mL of CH2Cl2. The organic extracts are combined with the decanted organic phase, dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated, under reduced pressure, to afford 33.1 g (104%) of crude product, as a pale yellow liquid that crystallizes rapidly. The ee of the crude 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine is determined by HPLC analysis of the derived bis-Mosher ester to be 84%.
B. 6-Methoxy-7-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene. 1,1-Dimethoxyethylene (1.1 g, 12.5 mmol,) is added to a solution of methyl 2-oxo-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-2H-1-benzopyran-3-carboxylate (507 mg, 2.44 mmol) in dry toluene (2.5 mL,) in a dry, 11 × 13-mm, resealable glass tube. The tube is flushed with argon and sealed with a Teflon plug. The reaction is warmed at 110°C in an oil bath for 15 hr. The reaction is cooled and concentrated under reduced pressure. Purification of the product is effected by gravity chromatography on a 1.5 × 16-cm column of silica gel (30% ethyl ether–hexane eluant) collecting 5-mL fractions. The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (50% ethyl ether–hexane eluant) and those containing the product are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 451 mg (84%, 84–86%) of 6-methoxy-7-methoxycarbonyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene as a white solid: mp 98.5–99.5°C (methanol–water,).
Workup. Method A. The reaction is quenched with aqueous saturated ammonium chloride (10 mL) and aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (40 mL). The mixture is then diluted with ether (60 mL) and transferred to a separatory funnel. The reaction flask is rinsed with ether (15 mL), and aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (10 mL) and both solutions are transferred to the separatory funnel. The two layers are separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with ether (20 mL). The combined organic layers are transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and a solution containing 60 mL of aqueous 2 N sodium hydroxide and 10 mL of aqueous 30% hydrogen peroxide is added in one portion. The resulting biphasic solution is stirred vigorously for 5 min. The two layers are separated and the organic layer is washed successively with aqueous 10% hydrochloric acid (50 mL), aqueous saturated sodium sulfite (50 mL), aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (50 mL), and brine (50 mL). The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude product is left under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) overnight (12-16 hr) to remove the butanol produced in this oxidative work-up. The product is purified by a Kugelrohr distillation (90°C, 0.8 mm) to afford 1.05 g (95%) of (2S,3S)-(+)-(3-phenylcyclopropyl)methanol as a colorless oil and.
An oven-dried, 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum inlet, and an outlet connected to a mercury bubbler is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 100 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). To this are added sequentially at 0°C, diisopropylamine (10.6 g, 14,7 mL, 105 mmol) and butyllithium in hexane (2.22 M, 47.3 mL, 105 mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred for 30 min and cooled to −78°C. β-Ionone (19.2 g, 20.3 mL, 100 mmol) is slowly added. After stirring the mixture for 1 hr at −78°C, diethyl chlorophosphate (18.1 g, 15.2 mL, 105 mmol) is added, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature over 2–3 hr (reaction mixture A).
The solution darkens to a deep wine-red color, and α-cellobiose octaacetate begins to crystallize on the second day. After seven days at 35° the semi-crystalline mass is stirred into 0 l. of cold water. With good stirring the flocculent precipitate of α-cellobiose octaacetate and cellulose-dextrin acetates soon becomes crystalline; after standing for one to two hours the solid is collected on a 12.5-cm. Büchner funnel, washed free from acid with cold water, and drained thoroughly. The moist product, weighing about 250 g., is triturated with 250 cc. of warm methyl alcohol, and, after cooling to room temperature, the undissolved solid is collected on a 7-cm. Büchner funnel, washed with three 50-cc. portions of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The yield of fairly pure α-cellobiose octaacetate is 69–74 g. For purification it is dissolved in 300 cc. of chloroform and the solution is filtered by suction into a dry receiver through a pad prepared by dusting Norite onto a Büchner funnel and washing the funnel with alcohol. The chloroform solution is filtered while the pad is still wet with alcohol, and the filter is washed at once with 100 cc. of chloroform without interruption in the filtration. The colorless filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure until the acetate begins to crystallize (about 250 cc.), the crystals are redissolved by warming, and the solution is poured into 750 cc. of warm methyl alcohol. The acetate begins to crystallize at once as small needles which eventually form a thick paste. The mixture is cooled to 0° with stirring, and after about one hour the material is collected, washed with 100 cc. of methyl alcohol, and dried at 40°. The yield of colorless α-cellobiose octaacetate, m.p. 220–222°, [α]20°D + 41.6°, is 65–69 g. (35–37 per cent of the theoretical amount, assuming that the cotton contains 10 per cent of moisture),, and.
In a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas-inlet tube and reflux condenser 20 g. (0.094 mole) of N,N'-diphenylethylenediamine (1,2-dianilinoethane) and 100 ml. of purified triethyl orthoformate are heated by an oil bath under nitrogen for 5 hours. The oil bath is maintained between 190° and 200°, and water is allowed to stand in the condenser. The water in the condenser begins to boil slowly, and the alcohol which is produced is allowed to escape. The reaction product which crystallizes during the reaction is filtered after cooling and washed with ether. There is obtained 19–20 g. (91–95%) of product, m.p. 285° (dec.).
B. 2-Aminobenzophenone. In a dry 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a reflux condenser connected to a hydrogen chloride trap, and a thermometer extending to the bottom of the flask are placed 146 g. (0.5 mole) of dry p-toluenesulfonylanthranilic acid, 1.5 l. of thiophene-free benzene, and 119 g. (0.57 mole) of phosphorus pentachloride. The mixture is stirred and heated at about 50° for 30 minutes. The murky solution is then cooled to 20–25°, and 290 g. (2.2 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is added in 4 portions. When addition is complete, the dark mixture is heated with stirring at about 80–90° for 4 hours. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured onto a mixture of 500 g. of ice and 40 ml. of 12N hydrochloric acid in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask. The benzene is best removed by vacuum distillation using a water aspirator. The grainy, brown, crude product is separated by filtration on a Büchner funnel and washed thoroughly with dilute hydrochloric acid, with water, then with two 500-ml. portions of 5% sodium carbonate (to remove anthranilic acid and starting material), and finally with three 500-ml. portions of water. The filter cake is sucked reasonably dry.
A 1-l., four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 145 g. (1.00 mole) of 2-phenylbutyronitrile, 2.3 g. (0.010 mole) of benzyltriethylammonium chloride, and 50 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide. The gas-inlet tube is adjusted to extend below the surface of the liquid, and a gas-exit tube is attached to the flask. A slow stream of acetylene is passed through the gas-inlet tube into the flask, removing the air. After 5 minutes, 56 g. of finely powdered potassium hydroxide is added and stirring is begun. Acetylene is introduced at the rate of 15–20 l./hour. An exothermic reaction occurs; the temperature rises to 70–80° and is held in this range with a cold water bath. After 40–60 minutes, a warm bath is required to maintain the temperature of the reaction mixture at 60–70°, and stirring is continued for an additional 20–30 minutes. The mixture is cooled to room temperature, the inlet tube is replaced with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and 500 ml. of water is added slowly. The resulting dark-brown mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed twice with 200-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene layers are combined and washed successively with 200 ml. of water, 100 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and 200 ml. of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the benzene is removed by distillation at reduced pressure. The residual oil is distilled through a short Vigreux column, giving 125–135 g. of crude product, b.p. 115–125° (13 mm.). Redistillation of this product through a Vigreux column gives 101–107 g. (59–63%) of colorless 2-phenyl-2-vinylbutyronitrile, b.p. 110° (8 mm.), n25D 1.5157.
In a 1-l. Erlenmeyer or round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer is placed 500 ml. of a commercial household bleach solution. The flask is placed in a pail of ice and rapidly stirred until the temperature drops below 10°. At this point the lights in the vicinity of the apparatus should be turned off. A solution of t-butyl alcohol (37 ml., 0.39 mole) and glacial acetic acid (24.5 ml., 0.43 mole) is added in a single portion to the rapidly stirred bleach solution, and stirring is continued for about 3 minutes.
A. (S,S)-Diisopropyl tartrate (E)-crotylboronate 2. An oven-dried 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 5-cm, egg-shaped stir bar, a rubber septum, and a digital and traceable thermocouple is connected to an argon line and is charged with t-BuOK (20.0 g, 95% purity, 170 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and anhydrous THF (85 mL) added by a syringe. This mixture is cooled to -78 °C with a dry ice/acetone bath, and then trans-2-butene (19.2 mL, 204 mmol, 1.2 equiv), condensed from a gas lecture cylinder into a 25-mL graduated cylinder immersed in a dry ice/acetone bath, is added via cannula. n-BuLi (2.5 M in hexane, 68.0 mL, 170.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 50 min using a syringe pump to make sure that the internal temperature does not rise above -65 °C. After the addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed, and the resultant yellow mixture is allowed to warm until the internal temperature reaches -50 °C (about 5 min). Then the reaction flask is quickly moved to an acetone bath precooled with dry ice to -50 °C. The internal temperature of the reaction solution is maintained between -50.0 °C to -50.5 °C for 25 min and then immediately recooled to -78 °C by moving the reaction flask to a dry ice/acetone bath.
Thirty grams of purified 2,4-dihydroxy-5-bromobenzoic acid is refluxed for twenty-four hours with 375 cc. of water, and the resulting solution is filtered, cooled, and extracted with a 400-cc. and a 200-cc. portion of ether. The ether is removed by evaporation, and the 4-bromoresorcinol is dried on a steam bath. The yield of product melting at 100–102° is 22–22.5 g. (90–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A dry, 2-L, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar and equipped with a rubber septum inlet is flushed with dry nitrogen and charged with 450 mL of purified tetrahydrofuran. After the contents of the flask are cooled using a dry ice–acetone bath, 72 g (1.2 mol) of methyl vinyl ether is distilled into the flask from a commercial cylinder. The septum is replaced, under a positive pressure of nitrogen gas, with a 500-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum inlet. The stirred contents of the flask are continuously cooled while 1.0 mol of tert-butyllithium in pentane solution (Caution! Solutions of this reagent are pyrophoric and extreme care should be exercised when carrying out this manipulation!) is transferred to the addition funnel and subsequently added to the mixture dropwise over ca. 1.5 hr. The resulting yellow slurry is allowed to warm slowly to 0°C over ca. 3 hr. With the addition of dry ice to the bath, the near-colorless solution is recooled to ca. −78°C and 84.6 g (0.78 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane is transferred to the addition funnel and subsequently added dropwise to the stirred mixture. The cold bath is removed and, after the mixture has reached room temperature, is allowed to stir for an additional 1 hr. The contents of the flask are carefully poured into a 2-L separatory funnel which contains ca. 400 g of ice and ca. 200 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. After separation of the aqueous layer, the organic solution is washed with water (12 × 250 mL), dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and distilled to give 89–95 g (88–94%) of 1-(methoxyvinyl) trimethylsilane (bp 102–104°C, 760 mm), nD20 1.4173 and.
The reaction mixture is cooled to 50–60°, and 1.75 l. of water is added, followed by 65 ml. of acetic acid to make the mixture distinctly acidic. The resulting suspension is stirred and boiled for 5 minutes in order to effect complete decomposition of the sodium salt.
The reaction mixture is freed from the acid by washing once with pure water and then with sodium carbonate solution, to which some sodium chloride is added to aid the separation of the hydrocarbon layer. If emulsification takes place, the addition of ether will remedy the difficulty.
After cooling, the crude product is transferred to a separatory funnel and the lower aqueous layer is drawn off and discarded. The upper layer is washed once with an equal volume of warm water, and then with successive portions of 10% sodium carbonate solution until all acid has been removed. It is then washed once with warm water, which is separated as completely as possible. The product thus washed is distilled from a Claisen flask under reduced pressure. The first few drops of distillate containing some water are discarded: the main fraction distils at 139–142°/2 mm. The yield is 1080 g. (90%).
The mixture is allowed to stand overnight and then poured into 1.5 l. of water in a 4-l. (1-gallon) crock. After cooling, the solid mixture of 3- and 4-nitrophthalic acids is filtered by suction through a Büchner funnel without a filter paper or through a filtros plate (p. 11). The wet cake is returned to the crock and stirred thoroughly with 200 cc. of water, which dissolves a large amount of the 4-nitrophthalic acid. The mixture is again filtered by suction, and the wet cake is dissolved by boiling with 200–300 cc. of water. The solution is filtered hot and stirred mechanically until crystallization starts. It is then allowed to stand overnight, as the crystallization is slow. The crystals are filtered by suction and air-dried. The product melts at 205–210° in a sealed tube. The yield is 200–220 g. (28–31 per cent of the theoretical amount). Recrystallization of 200 g. of the crude acid from 300 cc. of water gives 170 g. of acid melting at 215–218° (capillary tube sealed 2 cm. from bottom). The washings and mother liquor from the crystallization may be saved for the recovery of 4-nitrophthalic acid.
A. (−)-(S)-Ethyl 2-(benzyloxy)propanoate. As described in ref. 3, a flame-dried, 500-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and an argon balloon is charged with 11.8 g (100 mmol) of (S)-ethyl 2-hydroxypropanoate [(S)-ethyl lactate] and 50.9 g (200 mmol) of O-benzyl-2,2,2-trichloroacetimidate. The reagents are dissolved in 250 mL of a mixture of anhydrous cyclohexane and anhydrous dichloromethane (7:1 v/v) under an atmosphere of argon. Neat trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (0.4 mL, 4.53 mmol) is added dropwise by means of a syringe while the mixture is stirred rapidly. The reaction mixture is stirred for 48 to 60 hr at room temperature and subsequently diluted with water (100 mL) and hexane (300 mL). Stirring is continued for an additional 3 hr at room temperature. The precipitated colorless trichloroacetamide is filtered off by means of a Büchner funnel. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted three times with 50-mL portions of hexane . The combined organic extracts are washed with 50 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) solution and finally with 50 mL of aqueous saturated sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. After drying over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtration and removal of the solvents under reduced pressure by means of a rotary evaporator, the residue is purified by fractional distillation using a Vigreux column (15-20 cm) to yield 18.7 g (90%) of a colorless slightly turbid liquid.
The solution is cooled and then diluted with 450 cc. of water. The oily layer of chloronitrile is collected in about 80 cc. of chloroform and separated from the water solution. The chloroform solution is washed with about 125–150 cc. of calcium chloride solution (prepared by adding one volume of water to an equal volume of a saturated solution of crystallized calcium chloride) and once with 125–150 cc. of water, and then dried over fused calcium chloride.
B. Ethyl 4-Amino-3-methylbenzoate. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser, and a nitrogen-inlet tube is charged with 11.25 g. (0.05000 mole) of ethyl 4-amino-3-(methylthiomethyl)benzoate, 300 ml. of absolute ethanol, and 17 teaspoons (ca. 50 g.) of W-2 Raney nickel. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25° for one hour before stirring is discontinued, and the ethanolic solution is decanted from the catalyst. The catalyst is then washed with one 300-ml. portion of absolute ethanol and one 500-ml. portion of dichloromethane, the solvent being removed by decanting in each case. The organic solutions are combined and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, giving a solid which is dissolved in 200 ml. of dichloromethane, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and taken to dryness on a rotary evaporator, yielding 7.0–7.6 g. (77–84%) of ethyl 4-amino-3-methylbenzoate as a white solid, m.p. 75–78°.
To a 5-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a take-off reflux condenser, are added 2 l. of sulfur-free toluene and two boiling chips. The openings of the dropping funnel and the condenser are protected by drying tubes containing Drierite. A portion (200 ml.) of the toluene is distilled from the flask (take-off cock open) in order to dry the system by azeotropic distillation; then 100 g. (0.26 mole) of cholesterol and 500 ml. of cyclohexanone are added to the flask. After an additional 50 ml. of toluene has been distilled, a solution of 28 g. (0.14 mole) of aluminum isopropoxide in 400 ml. of dry toluene is added dropwise over a period of approximately 30 minutes. During this time toluene is distilled at a rate slightly greater than the rate of addition of catalyst solution, so that when the addition is complete about 600 ml. of toluene has distilled. An additional 300 ml. of toluene is distilled, and the murky orange-colored reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature.
D. Di-tert-butoxyethyne. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a dry-ice condenser protected from moisture by a potassium hydroxide tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, 0.5 mol of sodium amide is prepared in 500 mL of liquid ammonia, and 20 g (0.0968 mol) of (E)-1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene dissolved in 150 mL of anhydrous ether is added in a 5-min period with efficient stirring. After the addition, stirring is continued for 80 min. The reaction mixture is diluted with 200 mL of cold pentane (−20 to −30°C), and 400 mL of cold water is added very cautiously. The organic layer is washed with 50 mL of a 0.1 M buffered phosphate solution (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at aspirator vacuum without heating to give 10–12 g (78–86% yield) of di-tert-butoxyethyne as a pale-yellow oil. The product is sufficiently pure for further reactions, but it may be distilled at 30°C/0.05 mm; freezing point 8.5°C.
The contents of the flask are transferred to a 2-l. flask for fractional distillation (p. 130), having a column 40–50 cm. long, and distilled under atmospheric pressure, using an air condenser. The fraction boiling below 210°, amounting to 250–300 cc., is collected separately. The material remaining in the flask is nearly pure acetamide and may all be distilled, 1150–1200 g. passing over at 210–216°. By redistilling the fraction boiling below 210°, the yield may be increased to 1200–1250 g. (87–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). The acetamide thus obtained is pure enough for most purposes, but if a purer product is desired it may be recrystallized from a mixture of benzene and ethyl acetate; 1 l. of benzene and 300 cc. of ethyl acetate are used for 1 kg. of acetamide. Colorless needles melting at 81° are thus obtained. The solvent and the acetamide it contains may be recovered by distillation.
A. (±)-N,N-Dibenzyl-N-[1-cyclohexyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynyl]-amine. A 100-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a rubber septum is flame-dried under vacuum (5 × 10−2 mbar), cooled to rt, flushed with argon and charged with copper(I) bromide (143 mg, 1.0 mmol). The flask is evacuated (5 × 10−2 mbar) for 15 min, flushed with argon and charged with dry toluene (40 mL) giving a white suspension. Molecular sieves 4 Å (10 g) is added under a flow of argon. Trimethylsilylacetylene (1.96 g, 2.85 mL, 20.0 mmol) followed by cyclohexanecarbaldehyde (2.24 g, 2.42 mL, 20.0 mmol) are added via syringe in one portion. Dibenzylamine (3.95 g, 3.87 mL, 20.0 mmol) is added during 5 min via syringe. During the addition, the solution becomes clear and turns green at the end of addition. The reaction is slightly exothermic during the addition of dibenzylamine, and subsequently turns milky again. The reaction mixture is stirred for 24 h. After this time, GC-analysis shows more than 96% conversion to the desired product. The solution is filtered, and the molecular sieves 4 Å are washed with diethyl ether (150 mL). The solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation (55 °C, 760 mmHg, then 38 mmHg). The resulting light green oil is purified by column chromatography affording N,N-dibenzyl-N-[1-cyclohexyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-2-propynyl]-amine (6.86 g, 17.6 mmol) as a clear, colorless oil which solidifies upon standing at rt (88%).
When most of the hexane has been removed, 500 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran and is added. While the reaction mixture is stirred, 33.4 g. (0.220 mole) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-propanol is added dropwise over 15 minutes. After the evolution of hydrogen ceases, the stirred mixture is cooled with a water bath. When the mixture reaches 20°, 34.2 g. (15.0 ml., 0.241 mole) of methyl iodide is added dropwise over 5 minutes. The dropping funnel is replaced with a glass stopper, and the reaction mixture is stirred at 20–25° for 24 hours.
A. 9,9-Dibromobicyclo[6.1.0]nonane. A dry 3-l. three-necked flask is fitted with a glass stopper, stirrer, and condenser. The flask is kept under a positive nitrogen pressure by means of a gas-trap arrangement connected to the top of the condenser. The flask is quickly charged with 2 l. of anhydrous t-butyl alcohol and 73 g. (1.87 g. atoms) of potassium metal. (Caution! See earlier volume2 for handling of this metal.) The flow of nitrogen is stopped and the mixture is stirred and boiled under reflux until the potassium has reacted, hydrogen being liberated through the trap. The condenser is arranged for distillation by means of an adapter. The glass stopper is replaced by a pressure-equalized dropping funnel with the nitrogen inlet connected to the top. About 1.5 l. of t-butyl alcohol is then distilled into a predried flask under an atmosphere of nitrogen. A water pump is then connected, the nitrogen inlet is closed, and the distillation is continued under reduced pressure while the three-necked flask is gradually heated to 150° in an oil bath. Finally, the water pump is replaced by an oil pump and the white remaining solid is heated at 150° under a pressure of 0.1–1 mm. for 2 hours. The connection to the vacuum system is closed, the oil bath removed, and nitrogen again introduced. The condenser with adapter is replaced by a glass stopper, and the flask is cooled in an ice-salt bath.
The light yellow solution is transferred to a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure with slight warming. The solid product is triturated with 500 ml. of diethyl ether, filtered, and washed with three 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The white solid (291–296 g.) is dried under reduced pressure, m.p. 269–270° dec..
A dry, 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask and is fitted with an efficient reflux condenser protected by a drying tube, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer which extends well into the reaction mixture; the flask is arranged so that it can be cooled externally. In the flask is placed 161 g. (7 gram atoms) of sodium cut into shavings 1–2 mm. in thickness and; the sodium is just covered with dry ether (about 300 ml.). A mixture of 411 g. (321 ml., 3 moles) of n-butyl bromide and 471 g. (315 ml., 3 moles) of bromobenzene is added slowly from the dropping funnel over a period of about 2.5 hours, the temperature being kept as near 20° as possible; the mass acquires a bluish color.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, and clamped in a position such that it may be surrounded by a bath of water and ice when desired, are placed 300 g. (1.62 moles) of β-acetylaminonaphthalene (m.p. 131–132°) and 500 cc. of glacial acetic acid. With the mixture at room temperature, the stirrer is set in motion, and 200 g. (143 cc., 2.1 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.4) is added dropwise over a period of forty-five minutes; the temperature is kept below 40° by occasionally immersing the flask in the cooling bath. When about one-tenth of the nitric acid has been added, the reaction mixture sets to a mass that is stirred with difficulty. The addition of nitric acid is stopped at this point. After three to five minutes the mass becomes fluid, and the addition of nitric acid is resumed. When about one-fourth of the nitric acid has been added, all the solid material dissolves. Considerable heat is evolved at this point, and good cooling is required to keep the temperature from rising above 40°; the mixture must be cooled during the addition of the remainder of the acid. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for ten minutes longer.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice-salt bath is placed 215 g. (1.75 moles) of ethyl chloroacetate. Vigorous stirring is started, and to the cold ester 200 cc. of chilled aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9) is added. The solution is stirred in the cold for about fifteen minutes; then another 200-cc. portion of aqueous ammonia is added, and the stirring is continued for about fifteen minutes. The mixture is then allowed to stand for thirty minutes, filtered with suction, and washed with two 25-cc. portions of cold water to remove ammonium chloride. The yield of air-dried material melting at 118–119° is 128–138 g. (78–84 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The contents of the flask are then poured into 1300–1400 cc. of ice water, the ester layer separated, and the water-alcohol layer extracted twice with 700-cc. portions of benzene. The benzene extracts are added to the original ester, which has been separated. The total solution thus obtained is washed with about 400 cc. of 10 per cent sodium carbonate solution to remove the acid, then once with dilute sulfuric acid, and finally twice with 400-cc. portions of water. The benzene is distilled on a water bath, and the ester is distilled under reduced pressure. A small low-boiling fraction comes over first, and then the ester, which boils at 131–136°/9–10 mm. or 145–148°/17 mm.. The yield of product amounts to 284–315 g. (39–43 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the citric acid).
B. 2-(Phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-cyclohexadiene. A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with 53.0 g (116 mmol) of trans-3-(phenylsulfonyl)-4-(chloromercuri)cyclohexene and 600 mL of diethyl ether at room temperature. The slurry is stirred for 5 min and 175 mL (350 mmol) of a 2 M aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is added under vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture immediately turns black and the vigorous stirring is continued for 30 min. The two layers are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic layers are filtered through a short column containing 10 g of silica gel and the column is washed with 250 mL of diethyl ether. The ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give 22.5–24.5 g (88–96%) of 2-(phenylsulfonyl)-1,3-cyclohexadiene as a colorless solid.
B. Bromobis(dimethylamino)borane . A 500-mL, two-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel, and a distillation apparatus connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 100 mL of pentane and 92.7 g (0.648 mol) of tris(dimethylamino)borane , and cooled to −40°C (external bath temperature) with a dry ice-methanol bath. A solution of 81.3 g (0.324 mol) of boron tribromide in 80 mL of pentane is added dropwise to the stirred solution over a period of 1.5 hr maintaining the external bath temperature at −40°C. The cooling bath is removed and the solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Distillation affords 172.8 g (99%) of bromobis(dimethylamino)borane as a colorless liquid, bp 56-58°C (12 mm), lit.3 bp 20-28°C (0.5 mm).
In a 5-l. round-bottom flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer and reflux condenser, are mixed 1150 cc. of water, 840 cc. of commercial sulfuric acid and 700 g. (6 moles) of benzyl cyanide (p. 107). The mixture is heated under a reflux condenser and stirred for three hours, cooled slightly, and then poured into 2 l. of cold water. The mixture should be stirred so that a solid cake is not formed; the phenylacetic acid is then filtered off. This crude material is melted under water and washed by decantation several times with hot water. These washings, on cooling, deposit a small amount of phenylacetic acid which is filtered off and added to the main portion of material. The last of the hot water is poured off from the material while it is still molten, and it is then transferred to a 2-l. Claisen distilling flask and distilled under reduced pressure. A small amount of water comes over first and is rejected; about 20 cc., containing an appreciable amount of benzyl cyanide, then distils. This fraction is used in the next run. The distillate boiling at 176–189°/50 mm. is collected separately and solidifies on standing. It is practically pure phenylacetic acid, m.p. 76–76.5°, and weighs 630 g. (77.5 per cent of the theoretical amount). As the fraction which is returned to the second run of material contains a considerable portion of phenylacetic acid, the yield actually amounts to at least 80 per cent.
The residue remaining in the dish after evaporation is stirred thoroughly with 800 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. After filtration the alcohol is distilled on a steam bath and the last traces are removed under vacuum. While still warm the residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol containing 2 per cent of hydrochloric acid, and cooled. Two hundred cubic centimeters of ether is added, and the solution is filtered. This treatment should remove all but the last traces of sodium chloride and ammonium chloride. The alcohol and ether are removed by distillation and the last of the free hydrochloric acid is removed by distillation under diminished pressure.
In a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 200 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The flask is immersed in an ice-salt bath, and the acid is cooled to 0–5°. The crude dinitrobutane is added dropwise with vigorous stirring at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 8°. Stirring is continued for an additional 10 minutes after completion of the addition. The solution is poured cautiously onto 1 kg. of crushed ice with manual stirring. The ice is allowed to melt, and the product is separated by suction filtration, washed with water, and air-dried. Recrystallization from methanol at −70°, using a Dry Ice-methylene chloride cooling bath, yields 30–34 g. (41–46%) of 1,4-dinitrobutane, m.p. 33–34°,,, and.
The crude product is readily purified by conversion to its hydrochloride salt. The bisulfite salt is transferred to a wide-mouthed 1-l. flask, and concentrated hydrochloric acid is added until the consistency of the resulting mixture is such as to permit mechanical stirring (100 to 200 ml. of acid). The slurry is heated on a steam bath with stirring for 1 hour (Hood!). The tan diaminouracil hydrochloride is filtered on a sintered glass funnel, washed well with acetone, and vacuum-dried over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield of diaminouracil hydrochloride is 104–124 g. (68–81%) and.
The filtrate is again brought to boiling in a clean flask and treated with a solution of 20 g. (0.34 mole) of sodium chloride in 200 cc. of boiling water. The precipitate formed is p-chloromercuriphenol together with some colored impurities. The mixture is heated to boiling and filtered through a large preheated Büchner funnel. The filtrate on cooling deposits white feathery crystals of o-chloromercuriphenol. The mixture is allowed to stand at least twelve hours and then filtered. The crystals are air-dried. They should be colorless and should melt above 147° (m.p. of pure substance 152°). If the product is pink or melts low it should be recrystallized from hot water. The average yield of fifteen experiments was 45 g. of ortho compound melting above 147°, which corresponds to 44 per cent of the theoretical amount.
A solution of 140 g. (1 mole) of glycine ethyl ester hydrochloride and 3 g. of sodium acetate in 150 ml. of water is added to the flask and cooled to 2° by means of an ice-salt bath. A cold solution of 80 g. (1.15 moles) of sodium nitrite in 100 ml. of water is added, and the mixture is stirred until the temperature has fallen to 0°. The temperature is maintained below 2°, and stirring is continued throughout all the following operations. To the cold mixture are added 80 ml. of cold, ethanol-free ethyl ether and 3 ml. of cold 10% sulfuric acid. After 5 minutes, the reaction mixture is blown over into the 1-l. separatory funnel by application of air pressure. The lower aqueous layer is quickly sucked back into the reaction flask. The ether layer is removed and immediately washed with 50 ml. of cold 10% sodium carbonate solution. This ether solution should be neutral to moist litmus paper; if not, the washing with sodium carbonate is repeated. The ether solution is finally dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel are placed 4 l. of glacial acetic acid and 1 g. of sodium chloride. The acid is heated to boiling on a sand bath until the sodium chloride is in solution, and then 1 l. of defibrinated blood is added in a thin stream from the dropping funnel over a period of about 30 minutes. The blood should not touch the sides of the flask. During this time the temperature is kept at 100–105°, and heating is continued for 10 minutes after all the blood has been added. The flame is then removed and the mixture allowed to cool and stand overnight.
A. 2-Hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (1). A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an internal thermometer and egg-shaped, Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer is charged with 150 mL of water (H2O) and 40 g of concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This aqueous solution is cooled below 0°C by immersion in an acetone/ice bath, and 2-amino-5-methylpyridine (18.2 g, 168 mmol) is added. The reaction mixture is treated with an aqueous solution of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) (15.4 g, 223 mmol in 30 mL of H2O) at a rate sufficient to maintain a reaction temperature of 0-5°C. After addition of the NaNO2 solution is complete, the resulting mixture is stirred at 0°C for 45 min, and then heated to 95°C for 15 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and a 50% w/w aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is added until a pH of 6.5-7.0 is achieved (≈30 mL). After the reaction mixture is heated to 60°C, the hot solution is extracted with ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (4 × 100 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to yield a pale-yellow solid. Purification by recrystallization from hot/cold ethyl acetate (EtOAc) (≈300 mL) gives 2-hydroxy-5-methylpyridine (11.2 g, 61%) as white crystalline needles.
A. Silver trifluoroacetate. To a suspension of 187 g. (0.81 mole) of silver oxide in 200 ml. of water is added 177 g. (1.55 moles) of trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting solution is filtered, and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The dry silver trifluoroacetate thus obtained is purified by placing it in a Soxhlet thimble and extracting with ether, or by dissolving the salt in 1.2 l. of ether, filtering through a thin layer of activated carbon, and evaporating the filtered ether solution to dryness. The yield of colorless crystalline salt obtained after removal of the ether is 300 g. (88%).
To a suspension of 800 g. of paraformaldehyde (corresponding to 26.7 moles of formaldehyde) in 5.5 l. of water containing 210 g. (4.77 moles) of acetaldehyde there is added 180 g. (3.22 moles) of powdered quicklime in small portions with vigorous mechanical stirring. The rate of addition is so adjusted that the temperature rises to 50° in thirty minutes, and during the subsequent additions the temperature of the mixture is not allowed to exceed 55°. The mixture takes on a slightly yellow color. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for three hours, the mixture is filtered by gravity, and the yellow filtrate is acidified with just enough dilute hydrochloric acid to give an acid reaction to litmus. Subsequent to the addition of 30 g. of Norite and stirring for five minutes, the solution is again filtered.
A cooled mixture of 200 g. (109 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid (2 moles) and 300 cc. of water is now added slowly with careful cooling, the pasty mixture being stirred with a thermometer and the temperature not being allowed to rise above 35°. Sodium sulfate crystallizes during this addition. The mass is now shaken vigorously with 400 cc. of ether and allowed to stand for some minutes. The ether is then decanted as completely as possible and the residue filtered with suction. The sodium sulfate is now shaken with six successive 300-cc. portions of ether, the ether solutions being subsequently employed for extraction of the filtrate. This latter requires 10–14 such extractions (each with 300–400 cc. of ether) for the satisfactory extraction of the β-hydroxypropionic acid. The combined ethereal solution is dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and the ether distilled from a water bath, the temperature of which is not allowed to rise above 50°. The product is then concentrated under reduced pressure from a water bath maintained at 55–60°. The residue should have attained constant weight after four to six hours of this treatment; it consists of a sirupy liquid of pale straw color which contains 75–80 per cent of β-hydroxypropionic acid (by titration). The yield is 120–125 g. (28–31 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 4-Triisopropylsilyl-3-butyn-2-one (2). A one-necked, flame-dried, 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum fitted with an argon inlet needle is flushed with argon. The septum is temporarily removed and the flask is charged sequentially with CH2Cl2 (54 mL), 4-triisopropylsilyl-3-butyn-2-ol (1) (5.8 g, 25.6 mmol) and technical grade MnO2 (85%, 34.4 g, 336.9 mmol), which is added in one portion. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min and then filtered through a short pad of Celite. The Celite is washed with CH2Cl2 (2 × 30 mL) and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (40 °C, water aspirator pressure). The resulting yellow oil is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation (80 °C, 0.2 mmHg; Note 4) to yield ketone 2 (5.0–5.1 g, 87–89%) as a clear oil. This material is used in the next step without further purification.
To a 100-mL, two-necked flask, is added a mixture of cyclohexanone (5.9 g, 60 mmol) , o-iodoaniline (4.4 g, 20 mmol) , and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) (6.7 g, 60 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) (60 mL). The mixture is degassed three times via nitrogen/vacuum, followed by the addition of palladium acetate (Pd(OAc)2) (2.24 mg, 0.1 mmol). The mixture is degassed twice and heated at 105°C for 3 hr or until completion of the reaction. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and partitioned between isopropyl acetate (150 mL) and water (50 mL). The organic layer is separated, washed with brine (50 mL), and concentrated under vacuum to dryness. The residue is chromatographed on 50 g of silica gel using 700 mL of ethyl acetate-heptane (1:6) as the eluent to give 2.22 g of 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrocarbazole (65%) as a pale brown solid.
The reaction mixture is stirred at 25° for 1 hour, diluted with 500 ml. of water, and extracted with two 200-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined extract is washed with five 100-ml. portions of water and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at 50° (30 mm.). The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure without a column, and the fraction boiling at 110–111° (7 mm.) or 101–102° (4 mm.) affords 61.0–63.6 g. (84–87%) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-propanol,.
A. N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (1). A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a magnetic stirring bar, and a dropping funnel is flushed with nitrogen or argon and charged with 32.3 g. (35.1 ml., 0.320 mole) of N-methylmorpholine. The flask is immersed in an oil bath maintained at 75°, and 32.4 g. (29.1 ml., 0.286 mole) of 30% aqueous hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise over a period of 2.5 hours. The mixture is stirred for 20 hours at 75°, at which time a negative peroxide test (potassium iodide paper) is obtained. The reaction mixture is cooled to 50°, and a slurry of 50 ml. of methanol, 0.5 g. of charcoal, and 0.5 g. of Celite is added. After being stirred for 1 hour, the mixture is filtered and the filter cake washed with three 15-ml. portions of methanol. The filtrate and combined washings are concentrated with a rotary evaporator (water aspirator vacuum), with the bath temperature finally reaching 95°, where it is held for 10 minutes. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the residual viscous oil is dissolved in 25 ml. of acetone at 60°. On cooling to 40° (with seeding, if crystals of the N-oxide are available) the product spontaneously crystallizes. The slurry is stored at room temperature overnight, cooled in an ice bath, and filtered. The crystals are washed with three 15-ml. portions of 0° acetone and dried overnight at 40° (0.01 mm.) The yield of colorless crystalline monohydrate 1 is 32.4–34.3 g. (83.8–88.7%), m.p. 75–76° and.
When most of the sodium has disappeared, 90–95 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added and the mixture is carefully diluted with water. The ester layer is separated, the water layer is extracted with about 25–50 cc. of ethyl acetate, and the combined ester portions are washed with 300 cc. of 6 N hydrochloric acid and then dried with sodium sulfate. The ethyl acetate is distilled from a water bath and the remaining liquid is transferred to a Claisen flask and distilled from an oil bath under reduced pressure. A small fraction comes over below 128°/6 mm. and is discarded. The ethyl cinnamate boils at 128–133°/6 mm.; 168–173°/46 mm. The yield is 120–130 g. (68–74 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In the flask are placed 200 ml. of dioxane, 100 g. (1.02 moles) of mesityl oxide, and a solution of 4.6 moles of potassium hypochlorite in 3 l. of water, and the stirrer is started. The mixture becomes warm immediately, and within 5 minutes chloroform begins to reflux. When the reaction becomes very vigorous the stirrer is stopped and the flask is cooled with running water. The stirring is resumed as soon as feasible and is continued for 3–4 hours, when the temperature of the mixture will have dropped to that of the room. Sodium bisulfite (about 5 g.) is then added to react with the excess hypochlorite.
C. Optical resolution of (±)-BINAPO. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser. The flask is charged with 10.5 g (16.0 mmol) of racemic BINAPO and 700 mL of chloroform. The solid is dissolved by heating at reflux temperature with stirring, followed by rapid addition of a warm solution of 6.0 g (16.0 mmol) of (−)-2,3-O-dibenzoyl-L-tartaric acid monohydrate [(−)-DBT monohydrate] in 460 mL of ethyl acetate. The mixture is stirred under reflux for 2–3 min and then allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The crystals formed are collected on a sintered-glass funnel and the filtrate is stored for recovery of (R)-(+)-BINAPO (see below). The solid product is dried at room temperature (0.05 mm) for 6 hr to give 7.2 g (89% of theory) of a 1 : 1 complex of (S)-BINAPO and (−)-DBT, mp 238–240°C (dec), [α]D25 −170° (ethanol, c 0.503).
Most of the ethanol is removed by distillation (1.5 hours) on a steam bath, and the residue is transferred to a modified Claisen flask and distilled. The fraction boiling below 50°/20 mm. is removed with the aid of a water pump, and the residue is distilled using an oil pump (at 3 mm. pressure). The portion boiling at 105–108°/3 mm. is collected as di-β-carbethoxyethylmethylamine; it amounts to 519–550 g. (83–86%).
B. 3-Methyl-2-buten-2-yl triflate. A solution of 2.58 g. (0.0300 mole) of 3-methyl-2-butanone and 2.78 g. (0.0352 mole) of anhydrous pyridine in 10 ml. of anhydrous n-pentane is placed in a dry, 50-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, and the flask is stoppered with a rubber septum. After the solution has been cooled in an acetone–dry ice cooling bath, 9.72 g. (5.80 ml., 0.0395 mole) of trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride is added with a hypodermic syringe, dropwise and with swirling over 2–3 minutes. The resulting mixture, from which a white solid separates initially, is allowed to warm to room temperature over 22–24 hours. During this period the reaction mixture becomes red in color, and a viscous, red semisolid separates. The supernatant pentane solution is decanted, and the residual viscous semisolid is washed with two 10-ml. portions of pentane. While the combined pentane solutions are stored over anhydrous potassium carbonate, the remaining red semisolid is dissolved in 5 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and extracted with three 5-ml. portions of pentane. The combined pentane solutions (including the solid potassium carbonate) are washed rapidly with 5 ml. of cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate and dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. After the orange pentane solution has been concentrated to a volume of approximately 10 ml. with a rotary evaporator, it is transferred to a small distilling apparatus. The remaining pentane is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 2.94–2.97 g. (45%) of a colorless, liquid fraction containing 3-methyl-2-buten-2-yl triflate and a lesser amount of 3-methyl-1-buten-2-yl triflate, b.p. 58–66° (22 mm.), n25D 1.3832–1.3898. Fractional distillation of this mixture with a 40-cm. spinning band column separated higher boiling fractions, b.p. 45–47° (12 mm.), that contained 98% of the 3-methyl-2-buten-2-yl triflate as a colorless liquid, n25D 1.3838.
A 250-mL flask equipped with a reflux condenser is charged with 6.75 g (0.225 mol) of paraformaldehyde and 16.57 g (0.075 mol) of N-methylanilinium trifluoroacetate. A solution of 7.30 g (0.05 mol) of α-tetralone in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran is added at room temperature. The N-methylanilinium trifluoroacetate dissolves, and the magnetically stirred mixture is refluxed for 4 hr under a nitrogen atmosphere. During this time a red color develops and the paraformaldehyde dissolves after 2 hr. After 4 hr the heating oil bath is removed and the red solution allowed to cool for 10 min. Diethyl ether (100 mL) is gradually added under efficient magnetic stirring, which induces the separation of a red gum. The ethereal solution is decanted from the red gum into a separatory funnel and washed with 50 mL of half-saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. The red gum is triturated with 50 mL of diethyl ether, and the resulting ethereal solution is then used to extract the washing water. The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration and concentration of the extract, first on a rotary evaporator then under high vacuum, afford 8.05–8.6 g of a heavy red oil. Trituration of this oil with 70 mL of diethyl ether precipitates impurities and causes some polymerization. Filtration through Celite and concentration under high vacuum give 6.8–7.2 g (86–91%) of material that solidifies in a freezer. Further purification by column chromatography over silica gel affords analytically pure material (mp 46–46.5°C) but lowers the yield to 70–82%.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are mixed 501 g. (3 moles) of pure p-nitrobenzoic acid (p. 392) and 626 g. (3 moles) of pure phosphorus pentachloride. The flask is provided with a calcium chloride tube from which emerges a tube leading to the surface of a flask of water, in order to absorb the hydrogen chloride formed during the reaction. The flask is placed on a water bath and heated with occasional shaking until the reaction starts (fifteen to forty-five minutes). Vigorous evolution of hydrogen chloride takes place, and the heating is continued until the reaction is complete (fifteen to thirty minutes after the reaction starts). There is thus formed a light yellow, homogeneous liquid.
The oily layer on top of the reaction mixture is separated and washed with two 100-cc. portions of water. The washed product is transferred to a 1.5-l. modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure from an oil bath. The first fraction contains a very small amount of water along with a mixture of heptanonitrile and heptaldoxime. The product is collected at 103–107°/6 mm. (temperature of the oil bath, 140–147°). The yield is 420–480 g. (81–93 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product solidifies slowly on cooling and melts at 44–46°. It can be used for reduction to n-heptylamine (p. 318) without further purification.
The flask is then fitted with a reflux condenser and the contents boiled for two hours. In order to saponify the small amount of ester which is produced, a solution of 20 g. of sodium hydroxide in 30 cc. of water is then added and boiling continued for two additional hours. The reaction mixture is then cooled and acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid; the precipitated trimethylgallic acid is filtered with suction and washed well with cold water. The product, which melts at 157–160°, is sufficiently pure for many purposes. It weighs 50–52 g. (89–92 per cent of the theoretical amount). It may be purified by recrystallization from 2 l. of boiling water with the use of decolorizing carbon, the filtration being carried out in a steam-jacketed funnel. In this way 41–43 g. of colorless needles melting at 167° is obtained.
B. 1-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole . A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a condenser and Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is flame-dried under a positive pressure of nitrogen, and charged with 1-(2-fluoro-4-iodophenyl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole (66.6 g, 211 mmol) , sodium methoxide (NaOMe) (34.2 g, 633 mmol), copper(I) chloride (3.13 g, 31.7 mmol), 230 mL of methanol and 70 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF). The resulting slurry is placed in an 80°C oil bath for 90 min so that a gentle reflux is maintained, then cooled to room temperature. The slurry is poured into a rapidly stirring mixture of 500 mL of isopropyl ether, 220 mL of aq 5% ammonium chloride (NH4Cl), and 350 mL of water in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask, rinsing with several small portions of methanol. The resulting slurry is stirred overnight. It is filtered through a 3"-pad of Celite in a coarse-frit glass funnel, and the filtrate is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with three 50-mL portions of isopropyl ether . The combined organic phases are washed with 200 mL of aqueous 10% NH4OH, filtered through a silica gel pad, and concentrated to provide a brown, free-flowing solid (42.0 g, 92% crude yield). The crude product is recrystallized by dissolving it in 100 mL of hot hexanes and stirring overnight at room temperature, then collecting the resulting brown solid (34.7 g, 75% yield).
A flame-dried, three-necked, 1-L flask equipped with a glass stopper, a water-cooled reflux condenser with a two-tap Schlenk adapter connected to a bubbler and an argon/vacuum manifold, a rubber septum, and a magnetic stir bar is charged with 13.2 g of 60% sodium hydride (331 mmol, 1.10 equiv) and tetrahydrofuran (250 mL). The flask is immersed in a water bath (22 °C) and a solution of 72.2 g of crude diallyl pimelate (301 mmol, 1.00 equiv) in 50 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added in a steady stream via cannula during the course of 5 min. Some moderate bubbling (hydrogen evolution) of the reaction mixture is observed during the addition. Following the addition, the suspension is heated to 40 °C and then stirred for 10 h whereupon the reaction mixture turned to a clear, yellowish solution. Once the starting material is consumed (based on TLC, Note 5), 24.3 mL of neat iodomethane (391 mmol, 1.30 equiv) is added to the mixture, which became a white suspension. After an additional 15 h at 40 °C, the mixture is cooled to ambient temperature (22 °C) and water (60 mL) is added carefully via syringe over the course of 9 min to obtain a clear, yellowish solution. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L, single-necked, round-bottomed flask, the THF is removed by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 150 mmHg), and the remaining solution is transferred to a separatory funnel (500 mL) and diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 75 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (1 × 50 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (5 g). After filtration through cotton, the organic solution is concentrated by rotary evaporation under vacuum (40 °C, 75 mmHg) to yield a yellow liquid. The material is purified by short-path distillation until the first drop of the distillate turned yellow to give 52.9–53.0 g (270 mmol, 90% yield) of a clear, colorless liquid boiling from 69-72 °C/0.08 mmHg. GC analysis found >99% product purity.
The gas inlet tube is replaced by a dropping funnel protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Isocaproyl chloride (84.7 g., 0.63 mole) is added to the reaction mixture with stirring over a period of 20 minutes. The dropping funnel is replaced by the gas inlet tube (inlet tube wiped with a dry towel), and, with stirring, acetylene is bubbled just below the surface of the mixture at a rate noticeably above the saturation rate. After 15 minutes to 1 hour the rate of absorption of acetylene suddenly becomes very rapid, and the acetylene is passed through as rapidly as it is absorbed. The introduction of acetylene is continued for 30 minutes after the rapid absorption (which lasts 1–2 hours) has subsided.
Meanwhile, a solution of anhydrous ZnCl2 (11.45 g, 84.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in 70 mL of THF added via syringe is prepared in a 100-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 2-cm stir bar and rubber septum (pierced with a syringe needle and argon-filled balloon). The ZnCl2 solution is added to the naphthalenide/silane mixture via cannula over a minimum of 20 min. The acetone/dry ice bath is removed and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature.
The flask is now disconnected from the stirrer and column, and the contents distilled off as completely as possible on the steam bath under reduced pressure. The remaining solid is freed from residual moisture and hydrochloric acid by allowing a slow current of dry air to pass over it, while still heating on the steam bath and maintaining a partial vacuum. It is then redissolved in distilled water; the solution is filtered with the use of decolorizing carbon, and again evaporated under reduced pressure.
The residue from which no more alcohol can be distilled is treated with about 2 l. of water and shaken thoroughly. The upper layer of n-butylmalonic ester is separated and distilled under diminished pressure from a 2- or a 3-l. Claisen flask. First a low-boiling portion is collected, consisting of alcohol, water, and butyl bromide; then a small intermediate fraction of unchanged malonic ester comes over; and finally n-butylmalonic ester boiling at 140–145°/40 mm., 130–135°/20 mm., and 235–240°/760 mm. The first fractions amount to less than 100 cc., while the main fraction weighs 860–970 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A mechanical stir paddle (60 mm in diameter) is fitted to an oven-dried 100-mL, 2-necked round-bottomed flask (24/40 joint). Copper (I) iodide (0.047 g, 0.25 mmol, 0.01 equiv), AgIO3 (0.070 g, 0.25 mmol, 0.01 equiv), L-valine methyl ester hydrochloride (6.19 g, 36.9 mmol, 1.5 equiv) and CaCO3 (2.10 g, 21.0 mmol, 0.9 equiv) are added sequentially to the reaction flask, and the mixture is stirred at the maximum rate (the submitters stirred at 230 rpm). Acetonitrile (5.5 mL) is added in one portion using a syringe under constant stirring. A white opaque mixture is obtained at the end of this step. Benzaldehyde (2.50 mL, 24.6 mmol, 1.0 equiv) is added over 15 seconds using a syringe under constant stirring, and upon addition the reaction mixture becomes an opaque yellow. A tert-butyl hydroperoxide solution (4.00 mL, 28.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv) is added using a syringe under constant stirring and the mixture turns green. The reaction flask is then placed in an oil bath at 40 °C for 6 h under constant stirring.
The reaction is carried out in a catalytic hydrogenation apparatus similar to the one described by Adams and Voorhees.1 In a 1-l. reduction bottle are placed 0.5 g. of platinum oxide catalyst1 and 50 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol. The bottle is connected to a calibrated low-pressure hydrogen tank and alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is then admitted to the system until the pressure is 1–2 atm. (15–30 lb.), and the bottle is shaken for 20–30 minutes to reduce the platinum oxide. The shaker is stopped, air is admitted to the bottle, and a solution of 61.0 g. (1.0 mole) of ethanolamine, 75.4 g. (94 ml., 1.3 moles) of acetone, and 100 ml. of absolute ethanol is rinsed into the reduction bottle with 50 ml. of absolute ethanol. The bottle is alternately evacuated and filled with hydrogen twice. Hydrogen is admitted to the system until the pressure is approximately 25 lb., and the bottle is shaken until the pressure drop indicates that the theoretical amount (1 mole) of hydrogen has been taken up and absorption ceases (6–10 hours). Air is admitted to the bottle, and the catalyst is removed by filtration through a Hirsch funnel with a filter plate of small diameter. The bottle is rinsed with a total of 75ml. of benzene, which is also poured through the funnel. The filtrate is rinsed into a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask with 25 ml. of benzene, and most of the solvent is distilled at atmospheric pressure. Distillation of the residue under reduced pressure yields 97–98 g. of 2-isopropylaminoethanol, b.p. 86–87°/23 mm. (94–95%, based on the ethanolamine used).
The dry white-yellow solid is suspended in 500 ml. of commercial absolute ethanol in a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a rubber-tube sealed mechanical glass stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask. The suspension is stirred and heated to 50°, and 50 g. (2.17 g. atom) of freshly cut sodium is added in quantities of about 10 g. each to the stirred mixture over a period of 5 minutes. The reaction mixture boils vigorously, and stirring is continued for an additional 15 minutes. The reaction mixture is then cooled and carefully diluted with 750 ml. of water. The white solid which separates is 9,10-dihydroanthracene, and it is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 300 ml. of water, and dried in air. It is recrystallized from ethanol (about 250–300 ml. of solvent is required), and the crystals are collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 20 ml. of cold ethanol, and dried in air. The yield of dry 9,10-dihydroanthracene in the form of broad, colorless needles, m.p. 108–109°, is 38–40 g. (75–79%).
A. Ethyl hydrazinecarboxylate. To 100 g. (96.9 ml., 2.00 moles) of 100% hydrazine hydrate, contained in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask, is added 236 g. (243 ml., 2.00 moles) of diethyl carbonate. The flask is fitted with a calcium chloride-containing drying tube and shaken vigorously, mixing the two liquids. After about 5 minutes, the milky emulsion becomes warm, and shaking is continued until a clear solution is obtained (approximately 20 minutes). The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride-containing drying tube and heated on a steam bath for 3.5 hours. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask and is distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column under reduced pressure, yielding 161–176 g. (77–85%) of a colorless liquid collected at 102–103° (18 mm.) or 117–118° (40 mm.), n22D 1.4495; IR cm−1 1640, 1725, 3350. The product, which may crystallize on standing, m.p. 45–47°, need not be purified for the next step.
Concentration of the filtrate and toluene washings under reduced pressure to ca. 11 mL affords, after cooling, collecting, washing 3 times with 3 mL of toluene, and drying the solid material, a second crop of product that weighs 1.04 g. This crop is an off-white microcrystalline powder, mp 204–206°C and [α]D25 + 33.6° (THF, c 1.12).
A. 1-Chloro-1,2-dicyanocyclobutane (1). A 2-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser provided with a gas-outlet tube connected by plastic tubing to a conical funnel inverted over a 5-l. beaker containing aqueous sodium hydroxide, for absorption of the evolved hydrogen chloride. The flask is charged with 562 g. (2.70 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride and 750 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The rapidly stirred suspension is heated to reflux, and a solution of 159 g. (1.50 moles) of 1,2-dicyanocyclobutane in 120 ml. of chloroform is added dropwise over a period of 40 minutes. After addition is complete, the solvents and the phosphorus trichloride formed during the reaction are removed by distillation at 100–150 mm. over a period of 40–60 minutes, with a bath temperature not exceeding 80°. The residual liquid is cooled to room temperature and dissolved in 400 ml. of diethyl ether. The etheral solution is placed in a 500-ml.dropping funnel and added over a period of 3 hours to a stirred slurry of 1.7 kg. (12 moles) of sodium hydrogen carbonate, 800 g. of crushed ice, and 500 ml. of water. During the addition the temperature is maintained between −5° and 0° with an external ice–salt bath, and after the addition, stirring is continued for 1 hour at the same temperature. The precipitated salts are removed by suction filtration through a sintered-glass funnel of medium porosity and are thoroughly washed with 300 ml. of ether. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous filtrate extracted with three 200-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator, yielding 166–174 g. (79–83%) of a yellow oil consisting of an isomeric mixture of crude cyclobutane 1.
B. 4-Iodoveratrole. In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected with a drying tube, is placed 110 g. (0.5 mole) of dry silver trifluoroacetate. The flask is flamed to remove all moisture, and 69 g. (0.5 mole) of dry veratrole is added. To the stirred suspension a solution of 127 g. (0.5 mole) of iodine in 1.6 l. of chloroform is added through the dropping funnel over a period of 2 hours. After stirring an additional hour, the mixture is filtered and the precipitated silver iodide is washed with 100 ml. of chloroform. The solvent is removed from the filtrate and washings under vacuum, and the residue is distilled through an 8-in. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 152–155°/15 mm. weighs 112–120 g. and constitutes a yield of 85–91% and.
The reaction mixture is filtered with suction, and the amine salt is washed with about 200 ml. of benzene. The filtrate and washings are combined and transferred to a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, benzene is removed at reduced pressure, and to the residue is added 500 ml. of 2N aqueous potassium hydroxide. This mixture is heated under reflux for 4 hours, by which time the solution should become completely homogeneous. The cooled solution is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, then acidified to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid (approximately 95 ml.). After the solution has been cooled in ice for at least 1 hour, the precipitated white solid is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and recrystallized from a minimal amount of hot water (105–125 ml. required at about 90°). The yield of colorless 6-ketohendecanedioic acid, m.p. 108–109° is 35–37 g. (60–64%).
B. The p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone of glyoxylic acid chloride. Caution! Since hydrogen chloride and sulfur dioxide are liberated during this reaction, it should be conducted in a hood. To a suspension of 50.2 g. (0.21 mole) of glyoxylic acid p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone in 250 ml. of benzene is added 30 ml. (49 g. or 0.42 mole) of thionyl chloride. The reaction mixture is heated under reflux with stirring until vigorous gas evolution has ceased and most of the suspended solid has dissolved (about 1.5–2.5 hours is required). The reaction mixture is then cooled immediately and filtered through a Celite mat on a sintered-glass funnel. After the filtrate has been concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure, the residual solid is mixed with 40–50 ml. of anhydrous benzene, warmed, and the solid mass is broken up to give a fine suspension. This suspension is cooled and filtered with suction. The crystalline product is washed quickly with two portions of cold benzene to remove most of the residual colored impurities, and then the remaining crude acid chloride is transferred to a flask for recrystallization.
In the meantime, a 12-l. flask containing a solution of 450 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 3 l. of water is placed on a steam bath and fitted with a stirrer, a separatory funnel, and an efficient ice-cooled condenser set for distillation. The stirrer is started, and the solution of the Grignard reagent, prepared above, is added. The acid solution is allowed to become warm but is kept below the boiling point by external cooling. After all the Grignard reagent has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam bath until no more pentane distils. The reaction flask is allowed to cool, and the n-butyl ether layer is separated, transferred to a 5-l. flask connected with the condenser, and heated with a free flame until the boiling point of the n-butyl ether is reached. The combined distillate is separated from a small amount of water, washed twice with 125-cc. portions of cold, concentrated sulfuric acid, and allowed to stand overnight with anhydrous potassium carbonate. After removing the potassium carbonate, the n-pentane is fractionated twice through an efficient 100-cm. fractionating column. The yield is 270–290 g. (50–53 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product which boils at 35.5–36.5°.
(A) Preparation of Sodium Cyanoacetate Solution.—In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask is placed 250 g. (2.65 moles) of monochloroacetic acid. To this are added 100 cc. of water and 375 g. (1.3 moles) of crystalline sodium carbonate (decahydrate), the mixture being gently warmed. The neutralization is completed by adding sodium carbonate solution using litmus paper as an indicator. The flask is transferred to the hood, and a solution of 130 g. (2.65 moles) of sodium cyanide in 250 cc. of warm water is added in two approximately equal portions, waiting after the first addition until no further evolution of heat occurs, or the mixture ceases to boil. The cooled solution is neutralized with hydrochloric acid, using methyl orange as an outside indicator. The solution is then diluted with water to 1 l. and filtered; it should be of a light straw color. It can be kept for long periods of time in a stoppered bottle, although the color deepens somewhat.
A. Acetamidoacetone. A mixture of 75.0 g. (1.0 mole) of glycine, 475 g. (485 ml., 6 moles) of pyridine, and 1190 g. (1.1 l., 11.67 moles) of acetic anhydride and is heated under reflux with stirring for 6 hours in a 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask. The reflux condenser is replaced by one set for downward distillation, and the excess pyridine, acetic anhydride, and acetic acid are removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The residue is transferred to a simple distillataion apparatus such as a Claisen flask and is distilled to give 80–90 g. (70–78%) of a pale yellow oil, b.p. 120–125° (1 mm.). This product is of satisfactory purity for use in step B.
The chloroform solution is washed with water (2 × 250 mL) and stirred with glacial acetic acid (250 mL) for 1 hr. The solution that results is washed with water (2 × 250 mL), and the chloroform phase is treated with 1.5 L of hexane and kept at 2°C for 48 hr. The material that precipitates is collected and dried at 0.1 mm in a desiccator (calcium chloride) for 5 hr to give p-methoxyphenyllead triacetate (20–22 g, 35–40%) as pale-yellow crystals, mp 138–139°C. The product may be kept for at least 3 weeks if stored at 2°C in a sealed container.
B. Benzofurazan oxide. A mixture of 16.4 g. (0.1 mole) of o-nitrophenylazide and 30 ml. of reagent grade toluene is placed in a 100-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and is heated on a steam cone. Moderate nitrogen evolution commences immediately and continues for about 3 hours. When there are no more visible signs of gas evolution, the solution is cooled in an ice bath. After a few minutes, precipitation of light straw-colored clusters of prisms commences. About 6 g. of pure product, m.p. 70–72°, is obtained in this manner. Evaporation of the mother liquor yields another 4.5–5.5 g. of the oxide, slightly darker in color, m.p. 69–71°, which may be purified by recrystallization from 15 ml. of 70% ethanol to give material having a melting point of 70–71°. The total yield is 10.5–11.5 g. (77–85%).
A. (+)-(1R,2R)-1-Phenylcyclohexane-cis-1,2-diol (2). A 3-L flask with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer and an inlet port open to the atmosphere is charged with 375 mL of water. Stirring is started and the following reagents are added in the order indicated through a powder funnel: potassium ferricyanide (247 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), anhydrous potassium carbonate (104 g, 0.75 mol, 3 equiv), methanesulfonamide (23.8 g, 0.25 mol, 1 equiv), potassium osmate dihydrate (46.1 mg, 0.125 mmol, 0.05 mol %), (DHQD)2PHAL [1,4-bis(9-O-dihydroquinidinyl)phthalazine, 486.9 mg, 0.625 mmol, 0.25 mol %], 1-phenylcyclohexene (1, 39.55 g, 0.25 mol) and tert-butyl alcohol (250 mL). The slurry is stirred vigorously for 2 days at a rate of 500 rpm. During this time, the product crystallizes in the top organic phase, beginning after 4 hr. Also, the appearance of the slurry gradually changes from a mixture containing red granules (ferricyanide) to yellow flakes, which are presumably a salt of iron(II).
A. Cyclobutanecarboxamide. (See.) A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a drying tube (Drierite), is flame-dried and allowed to cool to room temperature. The flask is equipped with a punctured rubber septum, through which is inserted a −90° thermometer. The flask is subjected to a nitrogen atmosphere by inserting a syringe needle connected to a nitrogen bubbler through the septum along with a second syringe needle used as an outlet. Under a flow of nitrogen the flask is charged via syringe with cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (6.0 g, 59.9 mmol,), 60 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, and N-methylmorpholine (6.6 mL, 59.9 mmol,). Stirring is commenced, and the solution is cooled to an internal temperature of −15°C using a dry ice–isopropyl alcohol bath at −20° to −25°C. Ethyl chloroformate (5.7 mL, 59.9 mmol; and) is added and the solution is stirred for 5 min. The addition of ethyl chloroformate results in an internal temperature rise to +8 to +10°C and the precipitation of a white solid. Following the precipitation the continuously stirred mixture, still in the dry ice–isopropyl alcohol bath, is allowed to reach an internal temperature of −14°C. Anhydrous ammonia, introduced into the flask via a syringe needle, is vigorously bubbled through the solution for 10 min with manual stirring; the internal temperature rises abruptly to 25°C. With the flask still in the cooling bath, stirring is continued for an additional 30 min, and the reaction mixture is stored in the freezer at −15°C overnight.
(R,R)-4,6-Dibenzofurandiyl-2,2'-bis(4-phenyloxazoline), DBFOX/Ph (5): A 100-mL, one-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar is charged with 2.40 g (4.85 mmol) of 4 and 50 mL of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2). After the suspension is cooled to −20°C, 1.49 mL (11.28 mmol) of diethylaminosulfur trifluoride (DAST,) is slowly added via syringe. After 18 hr at −20°C, 4 mL of aqueous 4N ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) is added and the resulting solution is stirred for 15 min at −20°C. Subsequently, the cooling bath is removed and 10 mL of water is added. The orange aqueous phase is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 15 mL) and the combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and concentrated under vacuum. The resulting material is chromatographed using silica gel (20% EtOAc/hexanes,) to yield 2.10 g (4.59 mmol, 94%) of 5 as an off-white foam. This foam can be recrystallized from EtOAc/hexanes to yield white crystals.
The reaction mixture is diluted with an equal volume of water and extracted with 400-ml. and 200-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts are washed with three 250-ml. portions of 20% aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated, leaving a yellow solid. Recrystallization from acetone gives 8.0–9.3 g. (55–64%) of crystalline α-diazo ketone, m.p. 200–202° (dec.).
A. Succinimide silver salt. A 3-l., two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 28.9 g. (0.292 mole) of succinimide in 1.2 l. of absolute ethanol. A solution of 48.58 g. (0.2860 mole) of silver nitrate in 200 ml. of dimethyl sulfoxide is added in one portion. The resulting solution is stirred as 700 ml. (0.280 mole) of 0.400 M sodium ethoxide in ethanol and is added dropwise over 1.5 hours. The off-white silver salt begins to precipitate after ca. 140 ml. of the sodium ethoxide solution has been added. Stirring is continued for 45 minutes after the addition is completed, and the reaction mixture is then stored in a refrigerator at ca. 5° overnight to complete the precipitation and aggregation of the product.
The solution is cooled and acidified strongly with 50 per cent sulfuric acid. The crude α-naphthoic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed until free from sulfate, and dried. The yield of crude material melting at 142–155° is 130–135 g. This is dissolved in 400 cc. of hot toluene, a small amount of Filter-Cel is added, and the solution is filtered through a hot Büchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath, filtered with suction, and the filter cake washed with cold toluene until the filtrate is practically colorless. A light-colored product melting at 159–161° is obtained. The yield is 118–121 g. (68–70 per cent of the theoretical amount).
F. tert-Butylcyanoketene. Typically, the ketene is prepared by dissolving 1 g. (0.003 mole) of 3,6-diazido-2,5-di-tert-butyl-1,4-benzoquinone in 10–25 ml. of anhydrous benzene. The solution is refluxed, and the disappearance of the starting material as well as the intermediate cyclopentenedione is followed by TLC. When the cyclopentenedione is no longer detectable, after approximately 90 minutes, the heating is stopped. The solution contains tert-butylcyanoketene in amounts equivalent to at least a 95% yield.
B. Trimethyl-p-benzoquinone. The aqueous solution containing approximately 0.17 mole of disodium nitrosodisulfonate is placed in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an ice bath. A solution of 10.0 g. (0.0734 mole) of 2,3,6-trimethylphenol in 100 ml. of heptane is added to the reaction flask, and the resulting mixture is stirred vigorously for 4 hours with continuous cooling, maintaining the reaction temperature below 12°. The yellow heptane layer is separated, and the brown aqueous phase is extracted with two 100-ml. portions of heptane. The combined heptane solutions are quickly washed with three 50-ml. portions of cold (0–5°), 4 M aqueous sodium hydroxide, followed by two 100-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. The organic solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated at 40° with a rotary evaporator, yielding 10.0–10.9 g. (91–99%) of crude trimethyl-p-benzoquinone as a yellow liquid, which crystallizes when cooled below room temperature. Further purification may be accomplished by distillation under reduced pressure, yielding 8.5–8.7 g. (77–79%) of the quinone, b.p. 53° (0.4 mm.), which crystallizes on standing as yellow needles, m.p. 28–29.5°.
After the addition of the reactants is complete, the reaction is allowed to stir for an additional 30 min while the solution warms to room temperature. The reaction mixture is then transferred to a separatory funnel. The viscous organic bottom layer is separated from the aqueous layer and is dissolved in 200 mL of ether. The reaction vessel is washed with 100 mL of ether, and this ether portion is used to extract further the aqueous layer. The ether layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The viscous oil is allowed to crystallize in an ice bath (0°C). The crystals are collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 500 mL of water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator at 0.5 mm for 48 hr. 80.8 g (93%) of white crystalline bis(2,2,2-trichloroethyl) hydrazodicarboxylate (mp 85–89°C) is obtained. This material is sufficiently pure for the next preparation. However, further purification can be achieved using an Abderhalden drying apparatus (refluxing 95% EtOH for 12 hr at 0.05 mm; MgSO4 desiccant). Material purified in this way melted at 96.5–97.5°C and.
5-Chloro-3-ethoxycarbonylbenzofuran. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, thermometer, and a pennyhead stopper. A 3-cm oval stir bar is added to the flask. 5-Chlorosalicylaldehyde (5.00 g, 31.9 mmol) is added to the flask along with 11 mL CH2Cl2 to form a thick white slurry, then 54% HBF4·OEt2 (0.50 g, 3.2 mmol, 0.1 equiv) is added by syringe directly to the stirring solution through the neck containing the pennyhead stopper, whereby a color change from a white slurry to an orange slurry is noted. The pennyhead stopper is then replaced with a clean and dry 100-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel with the Teflon stopcock closed. Ethyl diazoacetate (90% pure) (5.79 g, 45.7 mmol, 1.43 equiv) is added to the addition funnel and diluted to 33 mL with dichloromethane. The EDA solution is then added to the reaction mixture at a rate of 5-7 mL per minute, resulting in steady evolution of nitrogen (total addition time was 5-7 minutes) and an increase in temperature from the initial 23 °C to 38 °C with a gentle reflux. Once addition is complete gas evolution ceases within a minute and the reaction is assayed for completion by 1H NMR. A heating mantle is placed under the round-bottomed flask. The equalizing addition funnel is replaced with a pennyhead stopper. At this point the solution is dark yellow in color. A simple distillation apparatus is assembled in place of the original reflux condenser using a distillation adapter, Claisen head adapter, and a 100-mL receiving flask. The reaction mixture is concentrated by distilling CH2Cl2 (30-33 mL) and free EDA to a maximum pot temperature of 58-61 °C leaving a clear yellow viscous oil. After removal of the heating mantle the solution is cooled to room temperature using a water bath, then 4.0 g of 95-98% H2SO4 (39.2 mmol) is added by syringe directly to the stirring viscous oil through the neck containing the pennyhead stopper over a period of 1-2 minutes. The addition is only slightly exothermic, with a temperature rise of about 5 °C using a water-cooling bath, and a color change from a clear yellow oil to a cloudy yellow-orange suspension is noted. After 10 minutes, the second step is complete and ready for neutralization. With water bath cooling and rapid agitation, the acidic reaction mixture is neutralized by slow addition of 100 mL saturated NaHCO3 solution. The empty addition funnel is removed and replaced with a pennyhead stopper. The water bath is removed and replaced with a heating mantle. The aqueous mixture is azeotropically distilled, while maintaining high speed stirring in order to remove any trace of residual CH2Cl2 to a maximum pot temperature of 90 °C. Upon reaching 90 °C, the heating mantle is removed and the aqueous mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature while continuing to maintain rapid stirring. After crystallizing overnight, the crude yellow solid product is filtered using a Büchner funnel and dried to constant weight. The yield of crude material (~90% pure by NMR) is 5.99-6.08 g (84-86% uncorrected for purity).
The solutions are removed from the cathode and anode compartments and added to 200 ml. of water. The resulting mixture is extracted with four 150-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined pentane extracts are washed with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation through a short Vigreux column. The remaining pentane is removed by distillation and the residual yellow liquid is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 6.9–8.5 g. (47–58%) of 1,1-bis-(bromomethyl)cyclopropane as a colorless liquid, b.p. 65–67° (5 mm.), nD25 1.5341–1.5347.
B. 2,2,6-Trimethylcyclohexen-1-yl iodide (2). To an oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, magnetic stirring bar, and a 250-mL dropping funnel, are added 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexanone hydrazone (4.6 g, 0.03 mol), anhydrous ether (100 mL), and 2-tert-butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (1) (46.25 g, 0.27 mol). The mixture is kept under argon at ambient temperature and an ethereal solution (100 mL) of iodine (15.25 g, 0.06 mol) is added to the mixture over 40 min with vigorous stirring.. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for an additional 30 min. The ether is removed under reduced pressure and the residue is heated at 90°C for 30 min under an inert atmosphere. The reaction mixture is allowed to attain ambient temperature. Ether (100 mL) is added and the organic phase is washed twice with 2 N hydrochloric acid (30 mL), aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (30 mL), aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (30 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (30 mL). The organic phase is dried (sodium sulfate) and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to afford crude iodide (2). Purification of 2 can be achieved by flash chromatography affording pure iodide (2) (6.34 g, 85%) as a colorless oil..
B. 3,3-Dimethoxycyclopropene. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a gas-inlet tube, a thermometer, and an acetone–dry-ice condenser topped with a drying tube containing sodium hydroxide pellets. An acetone–dry-ice bath is placed under the flask, and ammonia is condensed into the flask from a commercial cylinder. When 350–400 ml. of ammonia has condensed, the inlet tube is replaced by a stopper, and a small piece (0.5 g.) of potassium metal is added to the ammonia. The cooling bath is removed, and ca. 0.05 g. of anhydrous iron(III) chloride is added. When the ammonia reaches reflux temperature, the blue color of the dissolved potassium turns to gray, and the remainder of the potassium (11.7 g., 0.300-g.-atom total) is added in 0.5-g. pieces at such a rate that a gentle relux is maintained. The stopper is then replaced by an addition funnel containing a solution of 1-bromo-3-chloro-2,2-dimethoxypropane (21.7 g., 0.100 mole) in 50 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, which is added to the gray potassium amide–ammonia suspension over a period of 15 minutes, during which time the mixture is maintained at −50° to −60° with the cooling bath. After 3 hours at this temperature, solid ammonium chloride (10.8 g., 0.20 mole) is added with stirring. Ammonia is allowed to evaporate by removing the cooling bath, and during the course of the evaporation it is replaced with 350 ml. of anhydrous ether. When the reaction temperature reaches ca. 0°, the resulting brown solution is filtered from inorganic salts and placed in a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask. The ethereal solution is then subjected to a vacuum (50–80 mm.) applied through a carbon tetrachloride–dry-ice condenser (ca. −25°), while the flask is immersed in an ice bath. After 4–5 hours, when the quantity of residue seems to remain constant, the dry-ice condenser is replaced with a distilling head. The pressure is decreased to 1–2 mm., the receiver is maintained at −78° with a cooling bath, and distillation yields 4.0–6.5 g. (40–65%) of 3,3-dimethoxycyclopropene as a clear liquid. This material has been purified further,2 but it can be used directly in the next step. If it is stored, it should be kept below 0°.
C. (3β)-3-[[(1,1-dimethylethyl)dimethylsilyl]-oxy]-Androst-5-ene-7,17-dione (4). A 200-mL, Erlenmeyer flask (24/40 joint) containing a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 3 (8.04 g, 20.0 mmol), 1 (146 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1.00 mol %), and 1,2-dichloroethane (40 mL). The suspension is sonicated for 5 min at 20 °C with occasional gentle swirling. After addition of T-HYDRO (14.3 mL, 99.5 mmol, 5.0 equiv) in one portion, the flask containing the reaction mixture is equipped with a septum containing an outlet needle and its contents are stirred at 40 °C (external temperature). The color of the solution turns from purple to dark red after about 2 min following addition of T-HYDRO. After 24 h the mixture is concentrated on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 10 mmHg). The product is purified by column chromatography. Fractions containing the product are combined, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 30 mmHg). The remaining white solid is dissolved in diethyl ether (20 mL) at room temperature. The solution is heated to 35 °C and then cooled to room temperature whereupon a white powder crystallizes from the solution. Diethyl ether is removed using a pipette. The above washing procedure is repeated twice. The resulting white powder is collected and dried overnight under reduced pressure at room temperature (60 °C, 4 mmHg) to yield 4 (5.50 g, 66 %).
When the reaction mixture has been at room temperature for 90 minutes, 300 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added slowly, followed by 500 ml. of chloroform. The resulting aqueous layer is separated and washed with three 100-ml. portions of chloroform, and the combined chloroform solutions are dried with sodium sulfate and decolorized with activated carbon. Removal of chloroform with a rotary evaporator leaves an oily residue, which is readily crystallized from 100 ml. of methanol. The colorless crystals are collected by filtration and washed with petroleum ether, giving 33.5–35.3 g. (72–77%) of 2-methylthio-2-phenyl-1,3-dithiane, m.p. 76–78°. A second crop of crystalline product may be obtained from the mother liquors.
The p-toluenesulfonyl chloride–aluminum chloride complex is quickly filtered through a glass wool plug into the addition funnel. The residue is washed rapidly with an additional 50 mL of dry dichloromethane and the funnel is quickly stoppered. The complex is added dropwise during 1 hr to the cold (0°C), magnetically stirred silylacetylene solution. On completion of the addition, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and is stirred for an additional 12 hr. The mixture is hydrolyzed by pouring it into a slurry of 20% hydrochloric acid (200 mL) and ice (200 g). The organic layer is separated, washed twice with water (150 mL), and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent in a rotary evaporator gives a brown solid that is recrystallized from light petroleum ether (bp 40–60°C) to yield 39.7–40.4 g (79–80%) of p-tolyl 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl sulfone as white crystals, mp 81–82°C.
Cold water is now placed in the water bath, while the stirrer is kept always in motion, and the temperature of the mixture is reduced to 20–22°. The mass is then filtered by suction and the sodium chloride sucked as dry as possible. This is then washed with about 800 cc. of acetone in small quantities, the washings being collected separately, and then transferred to a flask from which the acetone and water are distilled off with the use of a short fractionating column until the temperature of the vapor reaches 90°. The residue in the flask is then cooled and again filtered from a further small quantity of sodium chloride which separates during the distillation, the filtrate being added to the main product.
A. 6-Bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde cyclohexylimine (1). A 2-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a Dean–Stark trap, a reflux condenser, a magnetic stirrer, and a nitrogen inlet. The vessel is purged with nitrogen and charged with 40.0 g (0.16 mol) of 6-bromo-3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (6-bromoveratraldehyde). 22.4 mL (0.20 mol) of cyclohexylamine, and 800 mL of toluene. The mixture is refluxed for 16 hr. The solution is cooled to room temperature and the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The residual crystalline mass is recrystallized from a 3 : 1 hexane–methylene chloride mixture (1.5 L) to provide 48.4–51.4 g of the imine 1 as white crystals in two crops (mp 172–172.5°C)2.
In a glass-stoppered, wide-mouthed bottle cooled by ice water are placed 35 g. (0.42 mole) of thiophene (p. 578) and 50 cc. of benzene. With constant shaking, and cooling when necessary, 75 g. (0.35 mole) of yellow mercuric oxide and 109 g. (0.43 mole) of iodine are added alternately in small amounts during a period of fifteen to twenty minutes. The yellow mercuric oxide changes to crimson mercuric iodide. The mixture is filtered, and the residue is washed with three 25-cc. portions of ether. The ether-benzene filtrate is shaken with a dilute solution of sodium thiosulfate to remove excess iodine and then dried over 5 g. of calcium chloride and filtered. The ether and benzene are removed by distillation on a steam bath, and the residue is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure. 2-Iodothiophene distils at 73°/15 mm.; 80–81°/20 mm.; 90–94°/34–38 mm.. The yield is 63–66 g. (72–75 per cent of the theoretical amount). If the iodothiophene is still colored by traces of iodine, the color may be removed by shaking with a small amount of mercuric oxide.
A solution of 258 g. (2 moles) of heptaldoxime (p. 313) in 4 l. of absolute alcohol is heated to boiling in a 12-l. round-bottomed flask on a steam bath. The flask is equipped with a 150-cm. reflux condenser in which the inner tube is very wide (2.5 cm.). As soon as the alcohol begins to boil, the steam is shut off and the temperature is maintained by introducing strips of sodium through the top of the condenser. The total amount of sodium added is 500 g., and it should be added as rapidly as is possible without loss of alcohol. The last 150 g. of sodium melts in the hot mixture and may be added very rapidly without loss of alcohol or amine.
B. 2-[3,3'-Di-(tert-Butoxycarbonyl)-aminodipropylamine]-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, static nitrogen inlet and 1-L addition funnel is charged with cyanuric chloride (30.5 g, 0.165 mol, 1.00 equiv) and 300 mL of acetone. The resulting solution is left to stir at 0 °C for 1 h. A cooled solution of 3,3'-di-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-aminodipropylamine (54.9 g, 0.166 mol, 1.01 equivalent) in acetone (686 mL) is then added dropwise to the cyanuric chloride solution over a period of 3 h (the internal temperature remained at or below 2 °C during this addition). A white suspension forms during the course of addition. Sodium bicarbonate (13.9 g, 0.166 mol, 1.00 equiv) in water (195 mL) is added dropwise over a period of 1 h. A yellow mixture is obtained after complete addition. The resulting solution is left to stir at 0 °C for 3 h, which resulted in the formation of a white suspension. The mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature and stirred for an additional 15 h. The reaction mixture is concentrated without filtration (to approximately 200 mL) on a rotary evaporator at 31-40 °C. The resulting aqueous suspension is filtered. The solids are dissolved in 600 mL of dichloromethane. The organic phase is washed with water (3 × 250 mL), and a saturated, aqueous solution of sodium chloride (300 mL). The organic layer is dried with sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is concentrated using a rotary evaporator at 40 °C. The resulting solids are dried under vacuum to provide the product as an off-white solid (76.5 g, 0.160 mol, 96 %), mp 122.4-125.7 °C.
C. Diphenylcarbodiimide. A solution of 15.6 g. (0.1 mole) of benzohydroxamoyl chloride in 300 ml. of anhydrous benzene contained in a 500-ml. wide-mouthed Erlenmeyer flask is cooled to 5°, agitated vigorously, and treated with 10.1 g. (0.1 mole) of freshly distilled triethylamine added in one portion. The mixture is shaken continuously for 3 minutes while being cooled in an ice bath and then filtered rapidly through a Buchner funnel into a filter flask cooled in an ice bath. The residue is washed with 50 ml. of anhydrous benzene, pressed to remove as much of the adhering solution as possible, dried in an oven at 60°, and weighed. The yield of the triethylamine hydrochloride, m.p. 254–256°, is 13.4–13.6 g. (97–99%).
In a 2-l. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer and surrounded by an ice bath, is placed 143 cc. of fuming nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.52). Stirring is started, and 100 g. (0.61 mole) of barbituric acid (p. 60) is added over a period of two hours; the temperature is kept below 40° during the addition. The mixture is stirred for one hour after the barbituric acid has been added, and stirring is continued while 430 cc. of water is added and the solution is cooled to 10°. The mixture is filtered, and the residue is washed with cold water and dried on a glass tray at 60–80°. The nitrobarbituric acid is dissolved by adding it to 860 cc. of boiling water in a 2-l. flask and heating the mixture on a boiling water bath while steam is blown in until solution is complete. After filtration and cooling overnight, the crystals are removed, washed with cold water, and dried in trays in an oven at 90–95° for two to three hours. The product melts with decomposition at 181–183° when heated rapidly. The yield is 139–141 g.. On drying the product at 110–115° for two to three hours, the yield is 90–94 g. (85–90 per cent of the theoretical amount) of an anhydrous compound which melts with decomposition at 176°.
b. EQUILIBRATION OF KETONES (2). A solution of 62.4 g of crude 2 in 600 mL of ethanol, 80 mL of water, and 70.0 g (1.2 mol) of potassium hydroxide is refluxed for 3 hr. The solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of about 200 mL, and 500 mL of water is added. This aqueous solution is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with four 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and the solvent is evaporated at reduced pressure. The remaining oily liquid is distilled under reduced pressure at 0.05 mm. Three fractions are collected; the first fraction (boiling range 40–80°C) is discarded. Fraction 2 (boiling range: 80–100°C; 120°C oil-bath temperature) consists mainly of biphenyl with small amounts of ketone 2. Fraction 3 (boiling range: 100–110°C; 140°C oil-bath temperature) contains the main quantity of ketone 2. Fraction 3 and the decanted liquid of fraction 2 are combined to yield 47.3–54.5 g (79–91%) of pale-yellow oily 2.
To a solution of 100 g. (2.0 moles) of 98% sodium cyanide in 400 ml. of water, contained in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a Hershberg stirrer, is added 118 g. (2.2 moles) of ammonium chloride. The mixture is stirred at room temperature under a properly ventilated hood. When the ammonium chloride has dissolved, a solution of 212 g. (2.0 moles) of benzaldehyde in 400 ml. methanol is added in one portion. The reaction begins rapidly, the temperature rising to about 45°. Stirring is continued for 2 hours. The heterogeneous mixture, after dilution with 1 l. of water, is extracted with 1 l. of benzene, and the aqueous layer is discarded. The benzene layer is washed with three 50-ml. portions of water, and the aminonitrile is extracted, in the form of its hydrochloride, by shaking the benzene solution with 6 N hydrochloric acid, first with one 600-ml. portion and then with two 300-ml. portions.
Dry hydrogen chloride (p. 293) is passed into a solution of 100 g. (2.44 moles) of thoroughly dry acetonitrile in 113 g. (143 cc., 2.5 moles) of absolute ethyl alcohol contained in a 1-l. weighed suction flask surrounded by a freezing mixture of ice and salt, until an increase in weight of 95 g. (2.6 moles) is obtained. This requires about four hours but the time is diminished considerably if proper mechanical stirring is used. The flask is now tightly stoppered, the side arm being attached to a calcium chloride tube, and allowed to stand until the mixture has set to a solid mass of crystals. Usually this requires two or three days.
The product may be recrystallized by dissolving it in 200 ml. of hot ethanol (95%), filtering, and adding 315 ml. of hot water. The recrystallized product is washed on the filter with 200 ml. of aqueous ethanol, as before, and air-dried. The yield of white 3-carbethoxycoumarin is 79–85 g. (73–78%); m.p. 92–94°.
A 2-L filter flask is equipped with an 11-cm Büchner funnel with filter paper. The funnel is charged with Celite to a depth of 1 cm and 50.0 g of Florisil is spread evenly on top of the Celite. The above mixture is filtered through this pad of filter aid. The filter cake is rinsed with ethyl acetate, 2 × 100 mL . The resulting pale yellow filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure to yield 47.3 g (96.2%) of pale yellow crystals.
A pure product may be obtained by dissolving, with the aid of heat and stirring, 100 g. of 4-methylesculetin in a solution of 200 g. of borax in 700 cc. of water. The solution obtained is filtered while hot and then cooled, whereupon the esculetin borate separates. This is filtered off and dissolved in 1800 cc. of water, and the solution thus obtained added to 50 g. (27.2 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 500 cc. of water. 4-Methylesculetin separates and, after the mixture has been cooled, is filtered, washed, and dried. From 100 g. of the crude material, 85 g. of pure product melting at 272–274° (uncorr.) is obtained. This is generally nearly colorless but occasionally possesses a slight grayish tinge.
The condenser is again set downward, and the dropping funnel is replaced by a tube reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask. Steam is passed in, and the distillation is continued for several minutes after the boiling point reaches 100°. The distillate is discarded. The mixture in the flask is cooled, and to it is added carefully 350 ml. of 12N sodium hydroxide with stirring. The alkaline mixture is then steam-distilled until the distillate is no longer basic.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer 150 g. (1.24 moles) of technical dimethylaniline is dissolved in 750 cc. of dilute hydrochloric acid (1 part concentrated acid to 1 part water). This solution is now cooled to 0°, and a solution (previously cooled to 0°) of 90 g. (1.24 moles) of technical sodium nitrite in 150 cc. of water is added through a separatory funnel. During the addition of the nitrite solution, mechanical stirring should be employed and the flask cooled well with ice and salt, or the contents can be cooled directly by the addition of ice. The addition is made at such a rate (thirty to forty minutes) that the temperature does not rise above 5°. The precipitate of p-nitrosodimethylaniline hydrochloride is filtered off with suction, then washed with about 300 cc. of dilute (1:1) hydrochloric acid.
B. Lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two glass stoppers and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a gas inlet connected to an argon-vacuum manifold. The flask is flame-dried under vacuum, then filled with argon. After evacuating and backfilling with argon three times, the flask is charged with substituted aniline 1 (11.3 g, 63.7 mmol) and n-hexane (220 mL) under argon purge. The solution is cooled to −78 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath and a solution of n-BuLi (1.6 M in hexanes, 48 mL, 76.8 mmol) is added via the dropping funnel over 10 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 12 h during which time it is gradually warmed to room temperature; a white precipitate forms upon warming. The dropping funnel is replaced by a distillation head and condenser and all volatiles are removed under vacuum (approximately 7.5 mmHg) at room temperature without exposing the contents to the open atmosphere. Then ether (25 mL) and n-hexane (50 mL) are added to the remaining viscous liquid causing further precipitation of a white solid. The resulting suspension is kept at −30 °C under argon for 12 h. The white solids of lithium anilide etherate (2•Et2O) formed are collected by filtration under argon, washed with cold n-hexane (2 × 10 mL) and dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) to give lithium N-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-tert-butylamide etherate as colorless crystals (9.41 g, 57%). The filtrate is concentrated under vacuum to approximately half of its volume and slowly cooled to −78 °C to give a second crop of the product which is isolated by filtration under argon as described above (3.48 g, 21%).
A flame-dried, 500-mL, two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a reflux condenser attached to the argon line, and a glass stopper is charged with lithium aluminium hydride (5.12 g, 134.6 mmol) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) (150 mL). The resulting magnetically-stirred suspension is immersed in an ice bath and a solution of the crude hydrogenation product (5.93 g, 23.5 mmol) in THF (150 mL) is added dropwise over 10 min via a cannula at 0 °C. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and then refluxed under argon for 16 h. After cooling to 0 °C, diethyl ether (150 mL) is added, followed by the careful, portionwise addition of solid hydrated sodium sulfate (Na2SO4 · 10H2O) (17 g), which causes a vigorous evolution of hydrogen gas. The resulting viscous mixture is stirred for 30 min until gas evolution has ceased and the solids are removed by filtration through Celite. The filter cake is washed with CH2Cl2:MeOH (9:1) (150 mL) and the washings are combined, dried (Na2SO4), filtered and evaporated under reduced pressure to give crude diamine (3.95 g). The crude diamine is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (oven temperature 150–160 °C at 0.07 mbar) to afford 2.65 g (52% over two steps) of pure diamine as a colorless oil, having greater than 95% ee.
To a cooled and magnetically stirred solution of 23.4 g. (0.280 mole) of N-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and in 40 ml. of methanol is added 15.3 g. (0.282 mole) of sodium methoxide. The cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 minutes. The mixture is filtered rapidly through a 35-mm., coarse, sintered-glass funnel, and the filter cake is washed with 10 ml. of methanol. The filtrates are combined, refiltered, and mixed with 150 ml. of toluene.
B. 1,3-Dimethyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylazetidinone. A 250-mL Pyrex Erlenmeyer flask is charged with 1.25 g (5.0 mmol) of [(methyl)(methoxy)carbene]pentacarbonyl chromium(0)]. The flask is fitted with a rubber septum, evacuated, and filled with argon (four cycles). Dry petroleum ether (175 mL) is transferred via cannula into the flask to produce a dark-yellow solution. The solution is charged with 0.59 g (5.0 mmol) of N-methylbenzylidenimine. The flask is irradiated with six 20-W Vitalites. The solution turns brown and heterogeneous within an hour. After 3 days the solution is filtered through a bed of Celite, the precipitate is washed with dry petroleum ether, and the now lighter-yellow solution is sealed in a flask, degassed, and irradiated as before. After 5 days of further irradiation, the mixture is filtered and the filtrate is exposed to air and irradiated again until a colorless solution is obtained (ca. 1 day). Filtration through a bed of Celite and removal of solvent by rotary evaporation affords colorless crystals of essentially pure β-lactam 2. Recrystallization from hexane gives 0.67–0.76 g (65–74% yield), mp 76–77°C.
B. 2-[(1'-Ethoxy)-1-ethoxy]butanenitrile. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a condenser topped with a calcium chloride drying tube, a magnetic stirring bar, a 500-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 174 g (2.05 mol) of 2-hydroxybutanenitrile to which 0.5 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid has been added. The addition funnel is charged with 221 g (3.07 mol) of ethyl vinyl ether, which is then added dropwise to the stirring cyanohydrin at such a rate that the temperature is maintained at ca. 50°C. When the addition is complete, the mixture is heated to 90°C for 4 hr. The condenser is replaced with a distillation head and the dropping funnel and thermometer are replaced with stoppers. Direct distillation of the gold–yellow solution from the reaction flask yields 226–277 g (70–86%) of nearly pure 2-[(1'-ethoxy)-1-ethoxy]butanenitrile, bp 85–84°C (30 mm), as a colorless liquid.
A. Dimethyldioxirane (See Figure 1). A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a mixture of water (80 mL), acetone (50 mL, 0.68 mol), and sodium bicarbonate (96 g), is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure equalizing addition funnel containing water (60 mL) and acetone (60 mL, 0.82 mol). A solid addition flask containing Oxone (180 g, 0.29 mol) is attached to the reaction vessel via a rubber tube. An air condenser (20 cm length) loosely packed with glass wool is attached to the reaction vessel. The outlet of the air condenser is connected to a 75 × 350-mm Dewar condenser filled with dry ice-acetone that is connected to a receiving flask (100 mL) cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The receiving flask is also connected in series to a second dry ice-acetone cold trap, a trap containing a potassium iodide solution, and a drying tube. A gas inlet tube is connected to the reaction flask and a stream of nitrogen gas is bubbled through the reaction mixture. The Oxone is added in portions (10–15 g) while the acetone-water mixture is simultaneously added dropwise. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously throughout the addition of reagents (ca. 30 min). A yellow solution of dimethyldioxirane in acetone collects in the receiving flask. Vigorous stirring is continued for an additional 15 min while a slight vacuum (ca. 30 mm, water aspirator) is applied to the cold trap. The yellow dioxirane solution (62–76 mL,) is dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered and stored in the freezer (−25°C) over Na2SO4. The dioxirane content of the solution is assayed using phenyl methyl sulfide and the GLC method ((Note 7) and). Generally concentrations in the range of 0.07–0.09 M are obtained.
A mixture of ethyl cyanoacetate (56.6 g., 0.5 mole), freshly distilled butyraldehyde (43.2 g., 0.6 mole), 1 g. of palladium on carbon, and 80 ml. of glacial acetic acid is placed in a 500-ml. bottle suitable for attachment to a low-pressure reduction apparatus. A solution of piperidine (2.0 ml., 0.02 mole) in 20 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added, and the bottle is connected to the reduction apparatus.
The solution is then rapidly heated to boiling and carefully acidified with 250 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Diphenic acid precipitates as light brown crystals. After the solution has stood overnight the solid is removed by filtration and washed free of mother liquor while on the filter with about 50 cc. of cold water. When dried, the product melts at 222–227° (corr.) and weighs 39–40 g. (88–91 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The total yield amounts to 260–266 g. (48.5–49.5 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is contaminated by slight traces of d-glucose and possesses a very faint reducing power towards Fehling's solution. For complete purification it is recrystallized (with practically no loss and practically no change in melting point) from five parts of methyl alcohol with the use, if necessary, of decolorizing carbon.
The weight of water in the distillate is estimated, and about one-half of this amount of potassium hydroxide is added in the form of sticks, so that it will dissolve slowly. The mixture should be kept cool while the potassium hydroxide is dissolving. Bubbles of ammonia gas will be evolved. When solution of the potassium hydroxide is complete, the amine is separated and dried for several hours over solid sodium hydroxide which has been freshly broken up into small lumps. It is then filtered into a distilling flask and distilled at atmospheric pressure. If the product has been thoroughly dried, there should be no low-boiling material. All the diallylamine should come over at 108–111° and only a very small amount of higher-boiling material should remain. The yield is 62–68 g. (80–88 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The aldehyde is separated from the lower aqueous layer as a colorless liquid, dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled under reduced pressure using a Claisen distillation apparatus, yielding 92–94 g. (82–84%) of cyclohexanecarboxaldehyde, b.p. 52–53° (18 mm.), nD25 1.4484,. A purity of about 98% was established by GC analysis; the product is suitable for synthetic use without further purification.
A. t-Butyl S-methylthiolcarbonate. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel are placed 430 ml. (422 g., 5.33 moles) of pyridine, 508 ml. (395 g., 5.33 moles) of t-butyl alcohol, and 1.6 l. of chloroform. The solution is stirred while 536 g. (4.85 moles) of methyl chlorothiolformate is added dropwise over a period of 30–40 minutes, and the solution is then stirred and heated at the reflux temperature for 24 hours. The resulting solution is divided into three equal portions of about 1 l., and each portion is washed in a 2-l. separatory funnel with two 500-ml. portions of water, three 275-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid, and finally with 350 ml. of 1M sodium bicarbonate solution. The combined chloroform solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 5 hours, and the solvent is removed by distillation from a water bath at atmospheric pressure followed by the use of a water aspirator. Distillation of the residue from a 1-l. Claisen flask by means of a water or oil bath gives 419–497 g. (58–69%) of a colorless liquid, b.p. 62–65° (24 mm.), n25D 1.4525. This product is sufficiently pure for use in the preparation below but may be purified by distillation through a 30-cm. helices-packed column which gives 375–447 g. (52–62%) of the ester, b.p. 60–63° (24 mm.).
The conditions given in the preceding preparation are used for obtaining a suspension of 0.25 mole of ferrous chloride in 100 ml. of tetrahydrofuran, contained in a 250-ml. flask. The tetrahydrofuran is then removed under reduced pressure until the residue is almost dry. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, and to the residue is added a mixture of 42 ml. (0.5 mole) of cyclopentadiene and approximately 100 ml. (about 1 mole) of diethylamine. The mixture is stirred vigorously at room temperature for 6–8 hours or, conveniently, overnight. The excess amine is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is extracted repeatedly with refluxing petroleum ether. The extract is filtered hot, and the solvent is evaporated to leave ferrocene. The product is purified by recrystallization from pentane or cyclohexane or by sublimation. The yield is 34–39 g. (73–84%), m.p. 173–174°.
The base may be purified by steam distillation but distillation under reduced pressure is more satisfactory. The oil is dried over 5 g. of solid sodium hydroxide and distilled under reduced pressure. The first portion of the distillate may contain p-toluidine and must be carefully separated, as it causes rapid discoloration. The 3-bromo-4-aminotoluene is obtained as a colorless liquid of b.p. 120–122°/30 mm. or 92–94°/3 mm. It solidifies on cooling and melts at 16–18°. The loss on purification is about 15 per cent of the weight of the crude base.
A. Preparation of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP). An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen inlet, and septum, is filled with a nitrogen atmosphere and charged via syringe with 40.5 mL (33.9 g, 0.240 mol) of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and 250 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran. The rapidly stirred solution is cooled with an ice bath and 88.0 mL (0.220 mol) of 2.5 M butyllithium in hexanes is added via syringe over a 20-min period. This solution of lithium 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidide is stirred with continued ice bath cooling for a period of about 30 min while the next reaction is readied.
The trans-diol remains in the mother liquor and may be recovered by complete evaporation of the solvent followed by recrystallization of the residue from pentane. The yield of trans-1,2-cyclodecanediol is 38–45 g. (27–32%), m.p. 53–54°.
C. 2-(1,3-Dibenzoylimidazolidin-2-yl)imidazole hydrochloride.3 A 1000-mL Parr hydrogenation bottle is charged with 38.0 g (0.10 mol) of dry, unrecrystallized 2-(1,3-dibenzoyl-4-imidazolin-2-yl)imidazole hydrochloride suspended in 300 mL of 95% reagent-grade ethyl alcohol. Then 2 g of 10% palladium on carbon is cautiously added. The reaction vessel is now attached to the Parr hydrogenator and, after alternate evacuation and flushing with hydrogen gas, is shaken under a 50-psi atmosphere of hydrogen. Gas uptake ceases after absorption of 1 mol-equiv per mole of substrate; this requires ca. 2 hr. The catalyst is removed by vacuum filtration through Hyflow, the filtercake is rinsed with three portions of 95% ethyl alcohol, and the filtrate is stripped to leave solid, impure product. This is triturated with 200 mL of ice-cold acetone; filtration and rinsing of the solids with fresh acetone and ultimately with ether yield 33.2–35.8 g (87–94%) of air-dried material, mp 225–226°C. An analytically pure sample from isopropyl alcohol-ether melts at 225–226°C.
The reaction mixture is filtered through a Hirsch or Büchner funnel, and the bottle is rinsed with 50 ml. of benzene, which is also poured through the funnel. The filtrate is washed with two 50-ml. portions of 10% sodium chloride solution and three 25-ml. portions of water. The washings are extracted with three 10-ml. portions of benzene, and the combined benzene solutions are distilled under reduced pressure from a 250-ml. modified Claisen flask. The yield of ethyl n-butylcyanoacetate, b.p. 108–109°/9 mm., is 79–81 g. (94–96%, based on the ethyl cyanoacetate used).
In a 1-l. separatory funnel there are first placed 400 ml. of ether and 75 ml. of 10% phosphoric acid, and then the above amine salt is added. The mixture is shaken vigorously for a few minutes, an additional 50 ml. of 10% phosphoric acid added, and the vigorous shaking continued until all the solid has disappeared. The ether layer is separated, washed twice with 100-ml. portions of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is separated by filtration, the ether is removed at room temperature under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator, and the residue dissolved in 40–60 ml. of boiling ethanol. The levopimaric acid is collected by suction filtration, yield 26–31 g. (10–12%), m.p. 147–150°, [α]25D −265°,, and.
After stirring for 40 min at 35 °C, 3.0 mL of degassed saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution is added quickly via syringe. The color of the mixture turns from dark brown to reddish brown. The septum is replaced with a glass stopper and the reaction mixture is stirred under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) at 23 °C to remove tetrahydrofuran and dimethyl sulfide until the volume is halved.
A. Bromodiethylsulfonium Bromopentachloroantimonate ("BDSB") ( 1).An oven-dried, one-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar (egg-shaped, 45 mm length and 20 mm diameter) is purged with argon and sealed using a rubber septum and an argon inlet. 1,2-Dichloroethane (200 mL) and bromine (4.27 mL, 13.3 g, 83.3 mmol, 1.0 equiv) are syringed into the flask, which is then cooled in a −30 °C dry ice-cooled acetone bath. To this vigorously stirring dark red solution is added diethyl sulfide (9.88 mL, 8.27 g, 91.7 mmol, 1.1 equiv) via syringe over the course of 1 min. The solution instantly lightens to a yellow-orange color. Maintaining the temperature of the bath between -30 and -35 °C by occasionally adding more dry ice, an antimony pentachloride solution (100 mL, 1 M in CH2Cl2, 100 mmol, 1.2 equiv) is cannulated slowly into the reaction flask over 10 min. The color of the solution first darkens to an orange-red, and as the addition proceeds, a yellow precipitate is observed. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at -30 °C for an additional 30 min and then the acetone bath is replaced with a cold water bath (~10 °C). The water bath is heated slowly (~2 °C per min) until all of the precipitate has dissolved (bath temperature = 26-32 °C), yielding a transparent homogeneous red solution. At this time, the rubber septum and argon inlet are quickly replaced with a tightly sealed cap and the flask is moved to a 4 °C refrigerator. After 8 h at 4 °C, the flask (now containing significant amounts of orange crystals) is moved to a -20 °C freezer, where it is kept for 14 h. The crystalline product (1) is isolated by decanting the majority of the solvent and then removing any residual solvent via pipette. The crystals are then washed with cold (-20 °C) CH2Cl2 (2 × 10 mL) and dried under high vacuum (23 °C, 1 mmHg, 2 h) to afford 39.2-39.8 g (86-87%) of pure BDSB (1) as light orange plates.
C. (S)-(+)-4-Methyl-3-heptanone [(S)-4]. A 100-mL Schlenk tube, fitted with a gas inlet and Teflon stopcocks, is charged with 4.3 g (18 mmol) of crude (ZSS)-3 dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane, and cooled to −78°C (acetone/dry ice bath) under nitrogen. Dry ozone is passed through the yellow solution until a green-blue color appears (ca. 4 hr). The mixture is then allowed to come to room temperature while a stream of nitrogen is bubbled through the solution to give the yellow nitrosamine (S)-5 and the title ketone (S)-4. The solvent is removed by distillation at 760 mm (60°C bath temperature) and the residue is transferred into a microdistillation apparatus (10-mL flask, 5-cm Vigreux column, spider, collector device,). After a small forerun (3–4 pale-yellow drops), a colorless liquid distills to afford 1.6–1.7 g (56–58% overall) of ketone (S)-4; bp 63–67°C at 40 mm (110–115°C bath temperature), GLC analysis 98.2%, [α]D20 + 21.4° to + 21.7° (hexane, c = 2.2), [α]D20 + 17.88° (neat). To recycle the chiral auxiliary SAMP, see.
C. (RS,1S,2R)-(−)-2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenesulfinic Acid 1-(2,4,6-Trimethylbenzenesulfonylamino)-2-Indan-2-Yl Ester (3).2An oven-dried, 1-L three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a temperature probe and an argon inlet is charged with white crystalline 2 (20.0 g, 0.053 mol). Tetrahydrofuran (400 mL) is added via syringe at room temperature and the solution is cooled to −78 °C. After 5 min, 2-mesitylmagnesium bromide (58.4 mL, 1.0 M solution in tetrahydrofuran, 0.058 mol) is added to the solution over a 5 min period. The slightly yellow reaction mixture is stirred at −78 °C for 3 h and quenched at this temperature by addition of a saturated sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution (100 mL) via a 250-mL dropping funnel. The mixture is diluted with ethyl acetate (150 mL), warmed to room temperature with stirring, and transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The mixture is shaken, the phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure at 30 °C or lower to give 26.8 g (quantitative) of a white foam, which is impure 3. The resulting white foam is used without further purification.
For workup, an aqueous saturated ammonium chloride solution (1.6 L) is carefully added, cooling the mixture with an ice bath and. The mixture is extracted once with ethyl acetate (500 mL). After separation of the layers, the aqueous phase is extracted twice with ethyl acetate (2 × 250 mL). The combined organic layers are washed twice with brine (2 × 250 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the solvent is evaporated on a rotary evaporator at 45°C/100 mm. The resulting yellowish foam (200 g) and is dissolved in diethyl ether (100 mL) followed by the addition of ethanol (400 mL). After a few minutes a white solid precipitates that is the clathrate of the product with ethanol. After standing for several hours (or overnight), the crystals are filtered, washed with ethanol/diethyl ether (300 mL, 4:1), and ethanol (100 mL), and then dried overnight at 50°C/8 mm to give 125–130 g of colorless crystals.
In a 3-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a gas inlet tube reaching almost to the bottom, a sealed mechanical stirrer, and a gas outlet tube connected to a mercury valve, are placed 294 g. (3 moles) of cyclohexanone and 900 ml. of water. After the reaction vessel has been swept out with chlorine, the gas outlet tube is connected to the mercury valve, the flask is cooled in an ice bath, the stirrer is started, and 215 g. (slightly more than 3 moles) of chlorine is bubbled in as rapidly as the gas is absorbed (about 45 minutes).
A. 3-Methyl-2-furoic acid. A mixture of 35 g. (0.25 mole) of methyl 3-methyl-2-furoate (p.649) and 80 ml. of aqueous 20% sodium hydroxide is heated under reflux for 2 hours. The solution is cooled, acidified with about 50 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18), stirred vigorously for a few minutes to ensure freeing of the acid from its salt, then cooled to room temperature before the product is collected by suction filtration. The product is washed with about 25 ml. of water used in two portions, drained well on the funnel, then dried. The yield of essentially pure 3-methyl-2-furoic acid is 28.5–29.5 g. (90–93%), m.p. 134–135°.
A finely divided suspension and of 10.0 g. (0.056 mole) of phenanthrene in 200 ml. of dry methanol is placed in a standard ozonolysis vessel. The reaction mixture is cooled in a Dewar flask by an acetone-Dry Ice mixture to about −30° and, and ozone is passed through at a rate of about 20 l. per hour until all the phenanthrene has reacted.
A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 5-cm., glass-coated, magnetic stirring bar, a Dewar condenser connected to a static argon line, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, is sealed with a rubber septum. After flushing with argon, 30 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether and 19.5 ml. of 1.89 M (0.0368 mole) methyllithium solution are injected through the septum into the flask. A solution of 4.54 g. (0.0249 mole) of benzophenone in 35 ml. of anhydrous ether is placed in the dropping funnel and added to the reaction mixture over a 20-minute period. The mixture is allowed to stir for one half hour. The septum is removed, and the side arm is quickly adapted with Tygon® tubing leading through a tower of solid potassium hydroxide to a tank of anhydrous ammonia. After approximately 75 ml. of ammonia is slowly distilled into the flask, the tubing is removed, and 0.525 g. (0.0761 g.-atom, ca. 15 cm. added as 0.5 cm. pieces) of lithium wire is quickly added, and the flask is stoppered. After 15 minutes the dark blue color is discharged by the continuous addition of excess ammonium chloride (ca. 5 g. over a 15-minute period). The argon-inlet tube is disconnected, and the ammonia is allowed to evaporate. The residue is then partitioned between 100 ml. of aqueous saturated sodium chloride and 100 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Removal of the ether on a rotary evaporator yields 4.36–4.49 g. of crude product. Filtration of the product through 60 g. of Woelm alumina (Grade III) with 150 ml. of petroleum ether affords 4.16–4.31 g. (92–95%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, which on evaporative distillation in a Kügelrohr oven gives 4.12–4.21 g. (91–93%) of 1,1-diphenylethane, b.p. 100° (0.25 mm.), nD28 1.5691.
The residue is distilled through a 30-cm. column packed with glass beads giving 10 g. of a fraction, b.p. 85–105° (10 mm.), containing mainly p-chloroanisole, and 85–99 g. (68–80%) of p-chlorophenoxymethyl chloride, b.p. 105–108° (10 mm.), n23D = 1.5496, m.p. 28–29°,. The n.m.r. spectrum [CCl4, (CH3)4Si reference] had bands at δ 5.6 (s, 2H) and 6.6–7.3 p.p.m.
B. Acetone hydrazone. Anhydrous hydrazine is prepared by heating under reflux 100% hydrazine hydrate with an equal weight of sodium hydroxide pellets for 2 hours, followed by distillation in a slow stream of nitrogen introduced through a capillary leak. (Caution! Distillation in air can lead to explosion.) The distillate boils at 114–116° and the yield is 95–97%.
A condenser is attached to one of the side necks, and the carbon disulfide is distilled without removing the flask from the steam bath. After the removal of the solvent, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool somewhat; but while it is still warm, it is poured slowly with stirring over cracked ice to which hydrochloric acid has been added. In this way only a small amount of the aluminum chloride addition product remains in the flask. This is decomposed with ice and hydrochloric acid and added to the main product. The volume is now about 5 l. Each 2-l. portion is extracted twice with 300-cc. and 200-cc. portions of benzene or ether. The extracts are combined and washed twice with water, once with 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, and twice more with water. The final water washings should be practically colorless and the separation sharp, any precipitate being allowed to separate with the water.
Solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at reduced pressure, and the resulting crude pink solid is dried overnight under high vacuum. The yield of slightly pink solid is 176.5–180 g,.
C. (2SR,3SR)-2,4-Dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid. The crude product from the foregoing preparation (112–120 g) is dissolved in 500 mL of methanol and placed in a 2-L Erlenmeyer flask. A solution of 112 g (2 mol) of potassium hydroxide in a mixture of 500 mL of water and 500 mL of methanol is added with stirring, whereupon the reaction mixture warms to about 40°C. After stirring for 15 min crushed dry ice is added in portions to the vigorously stirring mixture until the pH is 7–8. The resulting solution is concentrated to a volume of about 500 mL with a rotary evaporator and extracted with two 300-mL portions of methylene chloride, which are discarded. The aqueous phase is then acidified to pH 1–2 by addition of 75 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid (vigorous evolution of CO2) and extracted with two 500-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are washed with 200 mL of saturated brine and dried over magnesium sulfate. After removal of the drying agent the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator to obtain 36–53 g of (2SR,3SR)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxypentanoic acid as a semisolid. Crystallization from hexane provides 30–43 g (41–60% overall yield) of pure hydroxy acid, mp 76–79°C.
The distillation is expediently carried out using a 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, an electrically heated 1.5 × 30 cm. column packed with V4A wire spirals (4 mm.), a short, air-cooled condenser, and an ice-cooled, three-necked, 250-ml. receiver flask. During the distillation, the liquid is stirred magnetically and heated with an oil bath. The first fraction, b.p. 55–58° (1 mm.), yields ca. 50 g. of isotetralin, more of which is collected when the column is heated to about 100°. The temperature in the head of the column thereby rises to 90–95°, and it is necessary to change the receiver flask. The second fraction, collected at 95–102° (1 mm.), yields ca. 108 g. of 1:1-adducts, which consists of 92% of the desired tricyclo product and 8% of the side-addition product. The residue mainly contains the 2:1-adducts. The fraction containing the 1:1-adducts is recrystallized from methanol (about 500 ml.), giving 87–97 g. (40–45%, based on isotetralin) of 11,11-dichlorotricyclo[4.4.1.01,6]undeca-3,8-diene as long, colorless needles, m.p. 88–89°.
With such an experiment as is described above, using 1000 g. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) in the solvent flask and about 150 g. in the end Wolff bottle, 1469 g. of solution is obtained in the main flask and 174 g. in the Wolff bottle, thus indicating that a total of 491 g. (89 per cent of the theoretical amount) of trimethylamine is present. There is thus obtained a 32 per cent solution in the main flask, which has a specific gravity of about 0.760 at +5°. By titration with standard hydrochloric acid, the same amounts of trimethylamine are indicated as are found by weighing. In several experiments, the yields were consistently 85–90 per cent of the theoretical amount.
A. 5-Methoxy-2-nitrophenylacetic acid, 2.3,4 A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 50-mL addition funnel, and a reflux condenser fitted with an inert gas (argon) inlet tube that is attached to a mineral oil bubbler. The system is flushed with argon, flame dried, cooled to room temperature, and maintained under a positive pressure of argon. The reaction flask is charged with 18.8 g (0.34 mol) of anhydrous powdered sodium methoxide in 60 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and 47.5 mL (0.35 mol) of diethyl oxalate is added over 5 min from the addition funnel. The ice bath is removed and the resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 15 min. At the end of this time a pale yellow, thick suspension results, to which 50 g (0.3 mol) of anhydrous powdered 3-methyl-4-nitroanisole, 1, is added, followed by 75 mL of anhydrous ether. The orange-red mixture is heated to reflux for 4 hr. After the flask is cooled to room temperature approximately 1 L of water is added to dissolve the resulting thick orange precipitate. The red solution is transferred to a 4-L beaker and kept cold using an ice-water mixture. Alternate portions of 30% hydrogen peroxide and 10 N sodium hydroxide are added to the cold red solution. Addition of hydrogen peroxide bleaches the solution and addition of sodium hydroxide restores the red color. This procedure is repeated 3 to 4 times until further addition of 10 N sodium hydroxide solution does not result in a color change. The yellow brown solid is collected by filtration; it is impure starting material (wt 6–10 g). The filtrate is poured into a 4-L beaker, cooled to 0°C, and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid to precipitate 5-methoxy-2-nitrophenylacetic acid. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with cold water until the filtrate is neutral, and then dried to give 45.3–48.5 g (70–75%) of an almost colorless product, mp 172–176°C. Two recrystallizations in methanol give colorless product, mp 175–176°C.
B. 2-Cyclohexyloxyethanol. A well-dried, 3-l. three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a condenser to whose top is attached a calcium chloride drying tube. The flask is charged with 242 g. (1.81 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride powder and is immersed in an ice-salt bath. Anhydrous ether (25–50 ml.) is added dropwise through the dropping funnel, stirring is begun as soon as possible, and an additional 450–475 ml. of ether is added rapidly (total volume of ether added: 500 ml.). The mixture is stirred for approximately 30 minutes and becomes a light gray solution. During this period a mixture of 16.7 g. (0.44 mole) of lithium aluminum hydride and 500 ml. of anhydrous ether is vigorously stirred in a 1-l. round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting suspension is added to the ethereal aluminum chloride solution through the dropping funnel. The resulting mixture, a gray slurry, is stirred for at least 30 minutes.
B. 1-(Hydroxymethyl)cycloheptanol. To a 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and a reflux condenser are added 1-[(methoxymethoxy)methyl]cycloheptanol (3.90 g, 20.7 mmol), methanol (50 mL), and hydrochloric acid (12.1 N, 0.75 mL). The reaction mixture is heated to 55°C for 1.5–2 hr. After completion of the reaction, as indicated by TLC, the reaction mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and carefully diluted with 35 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and stirred for 30 min. The methanol is removed under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator and the remaining aqueous mixture is extracted with three 40-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed once with 15 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to afford 2.9 g of crude product as a pale yellow oil. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on a 40-mm diameter column packed with 70 g of silica gel, using 40% ethyl acetate-hexane to elute the product. The desired fractions are combined and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to provide 1-[hydroxymethyl)cycloheptanol (2.3–2.4 g, 76–80% yield) as a white solid (mp 52–53°C).
A. 2-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)-N,N-dimethylacetamidine . An oven-dried, 250-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a 3-cm magnetic stirring bar is charged with 7.96 g (0.045 mol) of (3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)acetonitrile and 4.95 g (0.050 mol) of copper(I) chloride, fitted with a septum, flushed with argon, and maintained under a static pressure of argon using a gas bubbler. Using a 20-mL gas-tight syringe, 45 mL (0.067 mol) of a 1.5 M ethanolic solution of dimethylamine is added successively in three 15-mL portions at room temperature with vigorous stirring. The heterogeneous pale brown mixture is then heated at 70°C for 24 hr, during which time it becomes brown-red. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and poured with vigorous stirring into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 70 mL of aqueous 30% sodium hydroxide and 100 mL of diethyl ether; the mixture was stirred vigorously for 3 min. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 75-mL portions of diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate and filtered through a sintered glass funnel layered with 2 cm of Celite. The solid residue is washed with diethyl ether (20 mL). The combined filtrate and washings are concentrated by rotary evaporation followed by drying under reduced pressure (0.1 mm) for 1.5 hr to provide 9.1-9.4 g (93-96% yield) of a dark brown oil,(Note 7). The compound is stored under argon at −18°C until used in step B.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a reflux condenser are placed 144 g. (1 mole) of β-naphthol and 400 ml. of glacial acetic acid. Through the dropping funnel is then added a solution of 320 g. (2 moles) of bromine in 100 ml. of acetic acid. The flask is shaken gently during the addition, which requires 15–30 minutes. The β-naphthol dissolves during this period, and heat is evolved; the mixture is cooled somewhat towards the end of the addition to avoid excessive loss of hydrogen bromide. One hundred milliliters of water is then added, and the mixture is heated to boiling. It is then cooled to 100°, 25 g. of mossy tin is added, and boiling is continued until the metal is dissolved. A second portion of 25 g. of tin is then added and dissolved by boiling, and finally a third portion of 100 g. (a total of 150 g., 1.27 gram atoms) of tin is introduced. The mixture is boiled for 3 hours, cooled to 50°, and filtered with suction. The crystalline tin salts which are thus removed are washed on the funnel with 100 ml. of cold acetic acid, the washings being added to the main portion of the filtrate.
A. Tetramethyl 3,7-dihydroxy-1,5-dimethylbicyclo[3.3.0]octa-2,6-diene-2,4,6,8-tetracarboxylate. A freshly prepared solution (pH 8.3) of 5.6 g of sodium bicarbonate in 400 mL of water, 70 g (0.40 mol) of dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate, and a magnetic stirring bar are placed in a 1-L Erlenmeyer flask. The resulting solution is stirred rapidly as 17.2 g (0.20 mol) of biacetyl is added in one portion. Stirring is continued for 24 hr, during which time white crystals separate. The solid is collected by suction filtration and dried under reduced pressure to afford 60–62 g, mp 155–158°C. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath, acidified to pH 5 (pHydrion paper) with dilute hydrochloric acid, and extracted with three 100-mL portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined, washed with saturated sodium chloride, and dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure gives another 2–4 g of crude product. Recrystallization from hot methanol gives 58–60 g (73–75%) of the tetraester, mp 155–157°C, in two crops.
To a freshly prepared solution of 11.3 g. (0.10 mole) of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonic acid in 64 ml. of cold water there is added 24 ml. (24 g., 0.30 mole) of pyridine. The mixture is heated at about 90° on a steam bath for 20 minutes. It is then cooled to room temperature with stirring, and 13.8 g. (0.10 mole) of potassium carbonate is added. The water and excess pyridine are removed from the mixture by heating it at 30–40° in a rotatory evaporator in conjunction with a water aspirator. The residue is treated with 120 ml. of ethanol, and the insoluble precipitate of potassium sulfate is removed by filtration.
A solution of 80 g. (2 moles) of sodium hydroxide in about 500 ml. of water is prepared in a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a gas inlet tube reaching nearly to the bottom of the flask, a gas outlet tube, and a mechanical stirrer. The flask is placed in a water bath at 15–20°, and, after the contents have cooled to this temperature, 74 g. (96 ml., 1 mole) of tert-butyl alcohol is added together with enough water (about 500 ml.) to form a homogeneous solution. With constant stirring, chlorine is passed into the mixture for 30 minutes at a rate of approximately 1 l. per minute and then for an additional 30 minutes at a rate of 0.5–0.6 l. per minute.
B. 1,3-Dimethyl-5-oxobicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-carboxylic acid. A mixture of 11.2 g (53.4 mmol) of the foregoing crude ester in 40 mL of methanol and 8.0 g (143 mmol) of potassium hydroxide in 16 mL of water is refluxed under argon until the ester is no longer present when monitored by TLC. This takes about 1 day. Methanol is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the remaining dark solution is extracted with ether (2 × 50 mL), acidified to pH 1 with dilute sulfuric acid, and extracted with dichloromethane (4 × 50 mL). The organic layer is filtered through 100 g of silica gel and eluted with ether to remove most of the dark impurities. Concentration under reduced pressure gives 10.0 g of acid mixture. Distillation in a Kugelrohr apparatus at 180°C, 0.03 mm and one recrystallization from ether-pentane gives 7.0 g (67%) of pure bicyclic acid (isomeric purity >98%) as white crystals, mp 130–131°C.
B. Glycine t-butyl ester. In the center neck of a 500-ml. suction filtration flask is placed a gas-inlet tube which is connected to a nitrogen cylinder, and on the side arm of the flask there is attached an exit tube leading to a suitable ventilation duct. The flask is placed on a magnetic stirrer, and a solution of 28.9 g. (0.18 mole) of t-butyl azidoacetate in 150 ml. of methanol and 0.7 g. of 5% palladium-on-charcoal catalyst is added to the flask. A stream of nitrogen is swept over the surface of the stirred suspension for 5 minutes, the nitrogen cylinder is replaced by a hydrogen cylinder, and hydrogen is passed over the magnetically stirred mixture for 10 hours. The hydrogen is displaced from the flask by a sweeping with nitrogen, the catalyst is removed by filtration and is washed with 5 ml. of methanol. The filtrate is transferred to a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask, 15 g. (0.18 mole) of phosphorous acid is added, and the mixture is warmed gently to dissolve the phosphorous acid. The solution is cooled to room temperature, 150 ml. of ether is added slowly, and the solution is cooled at 0° for 12 hours. The precipitated glycine t-butyl ester phosphite is filtered, washed with ether, and dried in a vacuum oven at 70°, yield 29–32 g. (75–82%), m.p. 144–147° (dec.) and.

A 500-mL single-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a 250-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a Y-connector joint with one line fitted with a nitrogen inlet adaptor and the other with a rubber septum is charged with (S)-valinol (10.32 g, 0.10 mol, 1.0 equiv, Note 1), followed by ethanol (30 mL, Note 2) and carbon disulfide (18 mL, 0.26 mol, 2.6 equiv). The addition funnel is flushed with nitrogen and charged with a 2.25 M KOH (15.2 g, 0.27 mol, 2.7 equiv) in 1:1 EtOH/H2O solution (120 mL), which is added dropwise at room temperature over 15-20 min. The addition funnel is replaced by a Graham condenser fitted with a nitrogen adaptor, and the reaction mixture is stirred and heated at reflux for 72 h under a nitrogen atmosphere. After cooling, the volatiles are removed with a rotary evaporator. The resulting liquid is acidified with 0.5 M aqueous HCl (550 mL), added slowly at room temperature, and the mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The slightly acidic mixture is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over 5 g of MgSO4, then vacuum filtered (water aspirator, ~20 mmHg) through a cotton plug into a side-arm flask. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator to give 14.92-15.05 g (92-93% yield) of (S)-4-isopropyl-1,3-thiazolidine-2-thione (1) as a yellowish solid (mp 68-69 °C), which is used in the next step without further purification.
In a 5-l. flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 1.8 kg. (1.6 moles) of fresh 3 per cent hydrogen peroxide solution, 100 g. of 25 per cent potassium hydroxide solution, and 57 g. (0.35 mole) of veratronitrile (p. 622). The mixture is warmed slowly to 45°, with stirring, and the source of heat is then withdrawn. The reaction proceeds with evolution of oxygen, and the temperature continues to rise. The amide soon begins to separate; in about fifty minutes the reaction is complete and the temperature begins to fall. The mixture is cooled to 3–5° and allowed to remain in the cooling bath for one and one-half to two hours. The white crystalline product is filtered with suction and dried in the air. The veratric amide melts at 162.5–163.5° and weighs 55–58 g. (87–92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The united filtrate is evaporated on the steam bath until the volume amounts to 200 cc., at which point crystals should have already begun to separate from the hot solution. After standing at room temperature for twenty-four hours or longer, the crystals are filtered by suction as free from mother liquor as possible and recrystallized from an equal weight of distilled water. The filtrate from this recrystallization is evaporated on the steam bath and the second crop of dl-tartaric acid filtered and recrystallized as before. The yield is 65–75 g. (29–33.4 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask having a central 34/45 standard taper neck and two 24/40 standard taper necks are added 120 g (0.75 mol) of methyl hydrogen hexanedioate, 250 mL of methanol, 4.1 g (0.075 mol) of sodium methoxide, 10 mL of pyridine, and a magnetic stirring bar. The electrode assembly is inserted so that the platinum electrodes are immersed in the solution. A thermometer and reflux water condenser are attached. The mixture is heated to 60°C and stirred until the sodium methoxide dissolves.

A 50-g portion of L-asparagine monohydrate (0.33 mol) is added with stirring, followed by the addition of 43.6 mL of pivalaldehyde (34.4 g, 0.4 mol) with vigorous stirring, after which the mixture becomes homogeneous. At the end of 6 hr, the solution is chilled in an ice bath and 28.0 g of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, 0.33 mol) is added, followed by 25.8 mL of methyl chloroformate (0.33 mol). After 1 hr of vigorous stirring at ice temperature, an additional 8.5 g of NaHCO3 (0.11 mol) and 7.5 mL of methyl chloroformate (0.11 mol) are added. The ice bath is removed and the solution is allowed to warm to room temperature for 2 hr. Precipitation of heterocycle 1 is accomplished by slow addition of 125 mL of 10% hydrochloric acid (0.44 mol). The resulting solids are collected by vacuum filtration, rinsed with 225 mL of ice water and dried in a vacuum desiccator yielding 62.1–67.1 g (72–79%) of heterocycle 1 as a white solid, mp 201°C (dec), [α]D-108.5° (CH3OH, c 2.05).
A. (−)-Dibenzyl tartrate. A 300-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, Dean-Stark trap, and a reflux condenser.

The mixture is heated under reflux in an oil bath (about 130°C) for 13 hr. During this period the theoretical amount of water (0.62 mL) is collected. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, diluted with ether, and poured into 50 mL of aqueous, saturated sodium bicarbonate. The organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted twice with 20 mL of ether. The combined organic phases are dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the resulting crude product is triturated with hexane-ether (20:1, 210 mL) to give white crystals of (−)-dibenzyl tartrate. The precipitate is collected by filtration and washed with hexane-ether (20:1). The filtrate is further concentrated to give a second crop. The total yield is 6.2 g (94%), mp 49–50°C.
The flask is swirled, washing the crystals, and the pentane is withdrawn. The flask is connected to a vacuum (water pump) via the nitrogen inlet and warmed to room temperature. The crude cycloadduct 2 (6.1–7.3 g., 40–48%) is isolated as colorless needles, m.p. 43.5–45°, from the first recrystallization. Pure 2α,4α-dimethyl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1]oct-6-en-3-one (2) can be obtained by recrystallization from pentane at −78° with minimal loss, m.p. 45–46°.

A mixture of 170 g. of anhydrous sodium iodide and 1.2 l. of methyl ethyl ketone is heated on a steam bath for 1 hour with occasional shaking in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a water-cooled reflux condenser. 2-Chloroethyl benzoate (162 g., 0.88 mole) is added to the mixture, and heating is maintained for an additional 22–24 hours with occasional shaking. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and filtered through a 15-cm. Büchner funnel with suction. The inorganic salts on the filter are washed with 200 ml. of methyl ethyl ketone, and the filtrate is concentrated by distillation of about 1 l. of the solvent. The residue is poured into 1 l. of water contained in a separatory funnel, which is shaken, and the lower layer is withdrawn. The latter is washed successively with 200 ml. of 10% sodium bisulfite solution, 200 ml. of 5% sodium bicarbonate solution, and 100 ml. of water. It is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate (5–7 g.) and fractionated under reduced pressure. The yield of material boiling at 133–136°/2.5 mm., nD15 1.5820, is 190–196 g. (78–81%).
The resulting mixture is saturated with sodium chloride. The organic phase is separated, washed with three 50-ml. portions of saturated brine solution, dried over sodium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residue through a 7-cm. Vigreux column separates 15.34–15.99 g. (75–80%) of phenyl heptyl ketone, b.p. 118–120° (0.60 mm.) nD26 1.5034.

Freshly distilled cyclohexene (82 g., 1.0 mole) is added slowly from a dropping funnel over a period of 20–30 minutes while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained between 40° and 45° by cooling with an ice bath and by controlling the rate of addition. The reaction mixture is kept at 40° for 1 hour after all the cyclohexene has been added, and then it is allowed to stand overnight at room temperature.
A solution of 11.5 g. (0.5 g. atom) of sodium is prepared in 150 ml. of absolute ethanol in a 500-ml. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, a condenser, and a dropping funnel. While this solution is refluxing with stirring, a mixture of 37.8 g. (0.25 mole) of 4-chlorophenylacetonitrile and 50.8 g. (0.31 mole) of ethyl phenylacetate is added through the dropping funnel over a period of 1 hour. The solution is refluxed for 3 hours, cooled, and poured into 600 ml. of cold water. The aqueous alkaline mixture is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of ether and the ether extracts discarded.

B. 5-Benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-3-methylpentanoic-2-13C acid. A 50-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, a condenser connected to a nitrogen inlet, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The apparatus is purged with nitrogen and dried, and the flask is charged with 1.79 g (2.4 mL, 0.0177 mol) of freshly distilled diisopropylamine and 6.5 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath while 7.22 mL (0.0169 mol) of 2.34 M butyllithium in hexane is added from the dropping funnel over 30 min. After 30 min a solution of 0.439 g (0.00720 mol) of acetic acid-2-13C in 3 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added by syringe over ca. 10 min. The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice bath for 3.5 hr, after which 1.30 g (0.0073 mol) of 4-benzyloxy-2-butanone in 4 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added by syringe over 15 min. Stirring is continued for 2 hr at 0°C and 18 hr at room temperature.

(103 ml., 1 mole) of redistilled cyclohexanone, and 110 g. (120 ml., 1.5 moles) of ethyl formate is placed in a 5-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, stopper, and vent tube. The reaction is initiated by the addition of 5 ml. of ethyl alcohol to the stirred mixture, which is then placed in a cold water bath. Stirring is continued for 6 hours. After standing overnight, 25 ml. of ethyl alcohol is added, and the mixture is stirred for an additional hour. After the addition of 200 ml. of water, the mixture is shaken in a 3-l. separatory funnel.

The drying agent is removed by suction filtration, and the ether is evaporated on the steam bath. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure using a 6-inch Vigreux column. After a small fore-run there is obtained 88–94 g. (70–74%) of 2-hydroxymethylenecyclohexanone, b.p. 70–72°/5 mm., nD25 1.5110.
B. Mono(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)tartaric acid. In a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 6.1 g (18.5 mmol) of dibenzyl tartrate, 100 mL of dry dichloromethane, 4 mL (28.8 mmol) of triethylamine and 50 mg (0.4 mmol) of 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine. The stirred mixture is cooled to 0°C and 3.65 g (18.2 mmol) of 2,6-dimethoxybenozyl chloride is added portion-wise over 1 hr. The reaction mixture is then warmed to room temperature and refluxed for 12 to 18 hr (the reaction is easily monitored by TLC). The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool down to room temperature and poured in 100 mL of water, The aqueous phase is extracted with 2 × 75 mL of dichloromethane. The organic phases are combined, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give a viscous oil. This is purified by column chromatography on silica gel using a mixture of hexane, ether and dichloromethane (3:1:5) as eluent to afford 7.1–7.5 g (78–82%) of a clear oil identified as dibenzyl mono(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)tartrate. A 200-mL, pressure bottle is flushed with dry argon and charged with 5.8 g (11.7 mmol) of the above tartrate, 100 mL of ethyl acetate, and 580 mg of 10% palladium on charcoal. The argon is then replaced by hydrogen and the reaction mixture is shaken on a Parr apparatus at 20 psi and room temperature for several hours. The mixture is filtered through a pad of Celite and the filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator, and dried completely under vacuum (80°C, ≤ 1 mm, overnight) to afford 3.5 g (97%) of mono(2,6-dimethoxybenozyl)tartaric acid as colorless solid, mp 184–186°C. This material is practically pure and is used in Parts C, D without purification.
The aqueous distillate is treated with 650 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated on a steam bath, under reduced pressure, until the residual liquor becomes a syrupy mass. This is desiccated further by adding 150 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol and evaporating under reduced pressure. Two or three such treatments with alcohol dry the crystalline material sufficiently so that it no longer sticks to the sides of the flask. The crude product is dried in a vacuum desiccator over calcium chloride. The pale yellow, dry, crystalline solid weighs 200–215 g. (77–83 per cent of the theoretical amount). The dried product may be purified by dissolving it in an equal weight of boiling absolute ethyl alcohol and then chilling in an ice bath. The yield of pure white crystals melting at 81–82° is 180–190 g. (69–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Phenylsulfenyl chloride. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a nitrogen inlet, a pressure-equalizing 125-mL dropping funnel, and a magnetic stirring bar, is charged with thiophenol (21 mL), dry triethylamine (0.25 mL), and dry pentane (100 mL) under a blanket of nitrogen. The remaining neck of the flask is stoppered and the nitrogen is allowed to sweep gently through the flask and out of the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask and its contents are cooled to 0°C with an ice bath and stirring is begun. The dropping funnel is charged with sulfuryl chloride (19 mL). The sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise over a 1-hr period to the chilled thiophenol solution with stirring. During this addition, a thick layer of white solid forms. It gradually dissolves as it is broken down. After the addition is complete, the ice bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to stir for 1 hr longer while slowly warming to room temperature. During the course of the addition and subsequent stirring, the clear, pale-yellow solution becomes dark orange-red. The dropping funnel is replaced with an outlet adapter connected to a vacuum pump and the nitrogen inlet is exchanged for a ground glass stopper. The pentane and excess sulfuryl chloride are removed under reduced pressure at room temperature. The outlet adapter is replaced by a short-path distillation apparatus adapted for use under reduced pressure. The oily red residue is distilled to give phenylsulfenyl chloride as a blood-red liquid (26 g, 87%), bp 41–42°C (1.5 mm). This compound is stored under nitrogen until used in Part B.

A mixture of 100 cc. of water, 136 cc. (250 g., 2.5 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84), and 457 cc. (370 g., 5 moles) of commercial n-butyl alcohol is cooled to 0° and by means of the separatory funnel is introduced slowly beneath the surface of the nitrite solution, with stirring. The alcohol solution is added slowly enough so that practically no gas is evolved, and the temperature is kept at ±1°. This usually requires from one and one-half to two hours.
B. 4-Methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin (II). A mixture of 286 g. (1.6 moles) of crude, dry 4-methyl-7-hydroxycoumarin and 572 g. (5.6 moles) of acetic anhydride is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted to a reflux condenser by a ground-glass joint. The mixture is refluxed for 1.5 hours, cooled to about 50°, and poured with vigorous stirring into a mixture of 4 kg. of cracked ice and 4 l. of water. The precipitate is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with five 50-ml. portions of cold water, and spread on absorbent paper to dry. The drying is completed by placing the product in a steam oven for 10 hours. The yield of crude 4-methyl-7-acetoxycoumarin is 320–340 g. (90–96%). It may be purified by recrystallization from 95% ethanol (5 g. of compound to 20 ml. of solvent) and forms fibrous needles melting at 150–151°. The crude oven-dried product is finely powdered and used in the next step.
In the flask is placed 2.5 l. of absolute alcohol, and then there is added gradually 115 g. (5 atoms) of metallic sodium cut into pieces. This requires three to four hours. After all the sodium has dissolved, 650 g. (5 moles) of ethyl acetoacetate is added. The stirrer is started and the solution heated to gentle boiling. To the boiling solution 750 g. (5.47 moles) of n-butyl bromide is added over a period of about two hours. The refluxing and stirring are continued until a sample of the solution is neutral to moist litmus paper. The time varies from six to ten hours.
B. 3-Amino-3-pyrazoline sulfate. In a 2-l. four-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a mechanical stirrer with four blades is placed 308 g. (169 ml., 3.0 moles) of 95% sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.834). Absolute ethanol (450 ml.) is added dropwise over 20–30 minutes. The internal temperature is maintained at 35° by cooling. A solution of 85.1 g. (1.00 mole) of β-cyanoethylhydrazine in 50 ml. of absolute ethanol is added with vigorous stirring over 1–2 minutes without further cooling. The mixture warms spontaneously to 88–90° and is kept at this temperature for 3 minutes until the product begins to crystallize. The temperature of the stirred mixture is gradually lowered during the next hour to 25° by cooling with water, and the mixture is then allowed to stand at room temperature for 15–20 hours. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed three times with 80 ml. of absolute ethanol and finally with 80 ml. of ether. After being dried at 80° the product weighs 177–183 g. (97–100%), m.p. 143–144°. The product is sufficiently pure for use in the following step; it may be recrystallized from methanol to give white needles, m.p. 144–145°.
A solution of 134 g. (0.81 mole) of chloral hydrate in 400 ml. of ether is placed in a 2-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and an efficient mercury-sealed stirrer. A solution of 12 g. of potassium cyanide in 220 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.9) is added through the dropping funnel over the course of 15 minutes at a rate sufficient to cause the ether to reflux vigorously. Stirring is continued for an additional 20 minutes. The layers are separated, and the ether layer is washed once with 75 ml. of water and once with 75 ml. of 10% aqueous sulfuric acid solution. (These washings are retained and used again later.) The aqueous layer from the reaction mixture is extracted with three 75-ml. portions of ether, and each ether extract is washed successively with the same water and sulfuric acid solutions used previously. The combined ether extracts are dried with 40 g. of sodium sulfate, the ether is removed by distillation, and the residue is recrystallized from 200 ml. of benzene. The solid is removed by filtration with suction and washed with two 25-ml. portions of cold benzene. The yield is 66–76 g. melting at 97.5–99.5° (cor.). Concentration of the filtrate gives 1–5 g. of material with a slightly lower (96–97° cor.) melting point, making the total yield 67–81 g. (65–78%).
Chlorotrifluoroethylene is introduced at such a rate, controlled by the needle valve, that it is essentially all absorbed in the reaction tube C, as indicated by the escape of little or no gas through tube G. At this rate, 233 g. (2 moles) is absorbed in 2–2.5 hours, during which the temperature rises to the point of reflux.
A. Diethyl (dichloromethyl)phosphonate, 1. An oven-dried, 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask (or a 1-L, three-necked flask with a Claisen head fitted in a side neck) is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, reflux condenser with a bubbler, and a 200-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel with a nitrogen inlet. Under a gentle flow of nitrogen the flask is charged with 400 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). The addition funnel is charged with a 1.9 M solution of isopropylmagnesium chloride in diethyl ether (83 mL, 0.158 mol). The mixture is cooled to −78°C with a dry ice/acetone bath, and isopropylmagnesium chloride is added over a few minutes with stirring. At this temperature, a solution of diethyl (trichloromethyl)phosphonate (38.3 g, 0.150 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (50 mL) is added dropwise over 15 min. The resulting solution is stirred for an additional 15 min at −78°C producing a clear orange solution. Anhydrous ethanol (12 g, 0.260 mol) in tetrahydrofuran (15 mL) is added dropwise at −78°C, producing a clear yellow solution. The resulting mixture is stirred for a few minutes, then allowed to warm slowly to −40°C. The reaction mixture is poured into a beaker containing a stirred mixture of 3 M hydrochloric acid (70 mL), and an equal volume of crushed ice and dichloromethane (70 mL). The yellow color initially dissipates, but the solution becomes yellow orange upon warming to room temperature. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 60 mL). The extracts are combined and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After the filtration, the solvents are evaporated on a rotary evaporator. The bright yellow, crude liquid (36.3 g) is transferred to a pear-shaped flask fitted with a 10-cm Vigreux column and distilled under reduced pressure to give 26.6 g (80%) of diethyl (dichloromethyl)phosphonate, 1, as a pale yellow liquid, bp 115–119°C/9 mm, >90% pure by 1H, 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy and.
B. 2,3-Dibromo-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-propene. To a solution containing 25.4 g (0.14 mol) of 1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1,2-propadiene in 100 mL of acetic acid in a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a dropping funnel is added 8.0 mL (0.14 mol) of bromine over a period of 30 min. The solution is stirred at room temperature for 8 hr, poured into 200 mL of water, and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL). The dichloromethane layer is washed with 50 mL of a 1.0 M aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, water (2 × 100 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL). The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered under reduced pressure through a 60-mL fritted funnel containing 4.0 g of Celite topped with 6.0 g of silica gel. The mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure to give 41.5 g (87%) of 2,3-dibromo-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-propene, which is used in the next step without further purification.
The crude product is usually yellow or orange in color. The color may be readily removed by dissolving the crude product in 200 cc. of hot ethyl alcohol and treating this solution with 5 g. of zinc dust and about 5 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). This solution is then filtered and the p-bromobiphenyl allowed to crystallize. This gives a white product melting at 89.5–90°. The yield is 20–21 g. (34–35 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer are placed 48.5 g. (0.22 mole) of the sodium sulfinate and 60 ml. of a mixture of 75 ml. of ethylene glycol and 120 ml. of carbitol or methyl carbitol. The mixture is stirred and heated in an oil bath until solution is complete, after which 31.5 g. (0.2 mole) of 4-chloronitrobenzene (m.p. 76–78°) is added. The mixture is heated for 3.5 hours at 141–143° (thermometer in the mixture), with continued stirring, and then is allowed to cool overnight. After the addition of 20 ml. of water, the pasty lumps are broken up, and the solid is filtered with suction and washed with 50–75 ml. of hot water. The solid is then transferred to a 1-l. flask and refluxed with 250 ml. of 95% ethanol for 15 minutes. After cooling, the p-nitro-p'-acetylaminodiphenylsulfone is filtered with suction and washed on the funnel, first with 25 ml. of ethanol and then with 25 ml. of ether. After drying in the air, the tan-colored solid weighs 32–33 g. (50–52%) and melts at 226–228°.
In a 500-ml. beaker equipped with a mechanical stirrer are placed 27 g. (0.2 mole) of p-aminoacetophenone, 100 g. of chopped ice, and 53 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). To the stirred mixture is added, over a period of 5 minutes, a solution of 13.8 g. (0.2 mole) of sodium nitrite dissolved in 75 ml. of water. The stirring is continued for 15 minutes, during which all the insoluble amine hydrochloride reacts to form the soluble diazonium compound.
A 2-l. flask containing 1.0 l. of anhydrous ether is fitted with a stopper bearing an inlet tube dipping below the surface of the ether and an outlet tube protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. After the ether has been cooled thoroughly in an ice-salt bath, the flask is placed on a balance and cold methyl bromide is introduced through the inlet tube until the gain in weight is 200 g. (2.1 moles).
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a reflux condenser the upper end of which is protected by a calcium chloride tube, are placed 146 g. (6 gram atoms) of dry magnesium turnings and about 250 cc. of dry ether.
Into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask are placed 45.9 g. (0.298 mole) of 7,7-dimethoxybicyclo[2.2.1]heptene, 75 ml. of 5% aqueous sulfuric acid, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is stoppered, and the mixture is stirred vigorously with a magnetic stirrer for 20 hours. The mixture is extracted with three 40-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration, and the solvent is distilled through a 12-in. Vigreux column. Fractional distillation of the residual oil yields 28.9 g. (90%) of colorless bicyclo[2.2.1]hepten-7-one, b.p. 96–100° (115 mm.), n25D 1.4786 and.
The stirrer is started, and hydrogen chloride is introduced through T2 at the rate of 6–10 bubbles a second. The acid in C is allowed to drop slowly into B, and the gaseous methyl nitrite is introduced through T1 into the reaction mixture. The solution in A develops a brown-red color, and after about ten minutes the ether begins to reflux gently. The rate of evolution of methyl nitrite is then adjusted so that the ether continues to reflux gently. About four hours is required for addition of the methyl nitrite. Stirring and addition of hydrogen chloride are continued for thirty minutes longer; at the end of this time the solution has ceased boiling and has assumed a clear yellow color.
B. 2-Bromoallylamine. Crude 2-bromoallylhexaminium bromide (204 g., 0.60 mole) is dissolved in a warm solution prepared from 400 ml. of water, 2 l. of ethanol, and 480 ml. (5.8 moles) of 12N hydrochloric acid. A white precipitate of ammonium chloride forms within an hour. The reaction mixture is allowed to stand for 24 hours, and the precipitate is removed by suction filtration. The mother liquor is concentrated to a volume of 600 ml., and the precipitate is removed by suction filtration. The mother liquor is evaporated to dryness, and the residue is dissolved in 300 ml. of water. The solution is cooled in an ice bath and made strongly alkaline (pH 13) with 6N sodium hydroxide solution.
B. (1R,2S,6R,7S)-1,10,10-Trimethyl-4-oxo-5-aza-3-oxatricyclo[5.2.1.0]decane , 3. A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 8.06 g (0.048 mmol) of crude (2S)-(−)-3-exo-aminoisoborneol (2), 70 mL of toluene , and 55 mL (0.12 mol) of 12.5% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution. The reaction flask is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, the dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 50 mL (0.095 mol) of triphosgene (1.9 M in toluene ), and the triphosgene solution is slowly added over 40 min with vigorous stirring to the two-phase reaction mixture. After the reaction is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 0°C for 1 hr and diluted with 130 mL of ethyl acetate . The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, and the layers are separated. The organic layer is washed successively with 150 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and 150 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to give 8.07 g of crude (1R,2S,6R,7S)-1,10,10-trimethyl-4-oxo-5-aza-3-oxatricyclo[5.2.1.0]decane (3) as a waxy pale yellow solid that is suitable for further reaction without purification.
A solution of 600 ml. of approximately 17% aqueous sodium hydroxide is placed in a 2-l. beaker and heated almost to the boiling point. At the end of the 45-minute period, the ammoniacal solution is added to the hot sodium hydroxide solution, and the mixture is heated rapidly to the boiling point. After it has boiled vigorously for 5 minutes, the stirred solution is cooled in an ice bath to room temperature. With the temperature held below 30°, concentrated hydrochloric acid is added with stirring until the solution is strongly acid. The heavy, yellow, microcrystalline solid which separates after stirring and cooling for about an hour is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed twice with water, and dried at 80°. The yield of bright yellow 6-hydroxynicotinic acid, m.p. 299–300° (dec., uncor.), is 29–37 g. (72–91%).
In a well-ventilated hood a 500-ml., three-necked flask is immersed in an oil bath and fitted with a condenser and a mechanical stirrer; a T-piece is inserted through a rubber stopper placed in the top of the condenser. One lead of the T-piece is connected to a nitrogen supply and the other to a gas bubbler. cis-3,4-Dichlorocyclobutene [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 6, 422 (1988)], 20 g. (0.16 mole), and 125 ml. of anhydrous benzene are added to the flask, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. Diiron nonacarbonyl, 25 g. is then added, the flow of N2 is stopped, and the mixture is heated to 50–55°, with stirring. After about 15 minutes the initial rapid evolution of carbon monoxide becomes greatly diminished and an additional 8 g. of the nonacarbonyl is added; additional 8-g. quantities are added at intervals (approximately 15 minutes), governed by the rate of carbon monoxide evolution. The addition is continued until no more carbon monoxide is liberated, and the reaction mixture is stirred at 50° for an additional hour. Approximately 140 g. of diiron nonacarbonyl is required for the complete conversion of the dichlorocyclobutene, the total reaction time being about 6 hours.
C. Methyl α-(bromomethyl)acrylate. In a dry, 250-mL three-necked flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and an addition funnel, 20 g (0.077 mol) of methyl β,β'-dibromoisobutyrate5,6 in 50 mL of anhydrous benzene7 is stirred vigorously. Triethylamine8 and (7.7 g, 0.076 mol) in 50 mL of benzene is introduced dropwise at a rate of about 3 mL per min. After the addition is complete the mixture is stirred for an additional 1 hr at room temperature, refluxed for 1 hr, and then cooled to 20°C. The reaction mixture is filtered with suction and the amine salt washed twice with 20 mL of benzene. The filtrate and washings are combined in a round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at 30–35°C to remove most of the benzene. The residue is transferred to a small distillation apparatus and fractionally distilled at reduced pressure using an oil bath at 50–55°C. The yield of ester collected at bp 35–37°C (1.3 mm) is 11.0 g (80%),(Note 19),(Note 20),(Note 21).
To prepare a purer product, the crude dibromoanthracene is extracted with carbon tetrachloride in an apparatus similar to that described on p. 375, the extraction is carried to the point at which crystals just begin to separate from the boiling solvent, and a fresh quantity of carbon tetrachloride is then taken. About eight extractions are necessary, 1 l. being used each time. The 9,10-dibromoanthracene so purified consists of brilliant yellow needles melting at 221–222° (corr.). A further quantity of pure product may be obtained by concentrating the mother liquor and recrystallizing the second crop so obtained. The recovered solvent may be employed for further extractions. The yield amounts to 400–420 g. (83–88 per cent of the theoretical quantity based on anthracene of 85 per cent purity).
The ice bath is removed after addition of the sodium cyanide, and the mixture is stirred for 4 hours. The organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 500-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts and organic layer are washed with two 100-ml. portions of cold water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The ethereal solution is filtered, and the ether is removed at atmospheric pressure. The residue is transferred to a vacuum distillation system and distilled under reduced pressure (Caution! See). The yield of α-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenylacetonitrile boiling at 88–90°/1.9–2.1 mm. is 842–844 g. (87–88%) and.
A. 9-Tetradecylcarbazole (1). A single-necked 500-mL, round-bottomed, side-armed flask equipped with a glass stopper and a magnetic stirring bar is connected to a nitrogen-vacuum manifold. After evacuating and backfilling with nitrogen three times, the flask (with stopper removed), in which a positive flow of nitrogen is maintained throughout the entire procedure, is sequentially charged with carbazole (12.5 g, 0.072 mol), 1-bromotetradecane (24.3 mL, 0.079 mol), THF (60 mL) and DMF (20 mL). To the stirred solution, NaH (60% in oil, 4.32 g, 0.11 mol) is added to the solution in small portions within 20 min, avoiding vigorous bubbling and heating. The flask is capped with a glass stopper and the resulting suspension is stirred for 2 h at room temperature under nitrogen. Methanol (30 mL) is slowly added to the reaction mixture within 5 min to quench the remaining NaH. The solution is transferred to a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and then is concentrated by rotary evaporation (15–20 mmHg, water bath temperature 50–55 °C) to afford a solid residue, which is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic layers are sequentially washed with 2 N aq HCl (2 × 100 mL), H2O (2 × 100 mL), then are dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated by rotary evaporation. The crude product is purified by column chromatography [silica gel, 80 × 250 mm, hexanes] to afford carbazole 1 as a white solid (25.8 g, 98%).
The product is obtained in the form of bright yellow crystals, m.p. 103–105°. The yield is 68–71 g. (69–72% based on p-toluenesulfonylanthranilic acid). This material is dissolved in 1 l. of hot 95% ethanol, treated with 15 g. of Norit, and filtered. The hot solution is diluted with 700 ml. of hot water and cooled. After a second recrystallization, the yield of hexagonal yellow plates is 47 g.; m.p. 105–106°. Another 6 g. of pure aminoketone can be recovered from the filtrate. The total yield of recrystallized 2-aminobenzophenone is 53 g. (54%).
4,4-Dimethyl-3-oxo-2-benzylpentanenitrile (1). A 250-mL two-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a rubber septum and a reflux condenser connected to an inert gas supply is flushed with inert gas for five minutes by venting through a needle in the rubber septum. The rubber septum is removed and the flask is charged with 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanenitrile (5.82 g, 46.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv.), Ru(PPh3)3(CO)H2 (0.21 g, 0.23 mmol, 0.005 equiv.), Xantphos (0.13 g, 0.23 mmol, 0.005 equiv.), piperidinium acetate (0.34 g, 2.3 mmol, 0.05 equiv.), anhydrous toluene (50 mL) and benzyl alcohol (4.82 ml, 5.03 g, 46.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv.). The rubber septum is replaced and the equipment flushed with inert gas for a further five minutes before replacing the rubber septum with a glass stopper. While still under an inert gas atmosphere, the solution is stirred and heated to reflux using an oil bath. Heating is continued for 4 h after which the reaction is deemed to be complete by monitoring the consumption of starting material via TLC. The resulting mixture is cooled to ambient temperature and transferred to a one-necked 250-mL round-bottomed flask. Solvent evaporation using a rotary evaporator affords crude (1) as a yellow oil. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to yield the product as a pale yellow oil (8.37 g, 84%).
The receiver is changed and the excess diethyl oxalate is distilled under reduced pressure in the range of 76–82°/15 mm.. The residue in the reaction flask, a viscous, red-brown mass, consists of the sodio derivative of ethyl α-ethoxalylstearate. To it is gradually added, without cooling, 66 g. (1.1 mole) of glacial acetic acid. As the mixture is stirred by hand, 1 l. of water is added. Finally, the mixture is stirred mechanically for a few minutes, then allowed to separate into layers. The organic (upper) layer is taken up in 300 ml. of ether and washed well with sodium bicarbonate solution and with water; then the ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath.
A. trans-2,3-Diphenyl-1-phthalimidoaziridine. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer is charged with a mixture of 19.5 g (0.120 mole) of N-aminophthalimide, 108 g. (0.600 mole) of (E)-stilbene, and 300 ml. of dichloromethane. To the resulting suspension is added 60 g. (ca. 0.12 mole) of lead tetraäcetate over a period of 10 minutes, at room temperature with vigorous stirring. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes, after which time the mixture is filtered through Celite®, which is washed twice with 50-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined filtrates are transferred to a 4-l. beaker, and 1.5 l. of pentane is added with gentle stirring and cooling in an ice bath. The yellow precipitate that forms after 15 minutes is suction filtered and redissolved in 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution obtained is swirled for 5 minutes with 20 g. of silica gel, filtered through Celite®, which is washed with two 100-ml. portions of dichloromethane. To this dichloromethane solution is added 1.5 l. of pentane, with cooling. The precipitate that forms after 0.5 hour is dried under vacuum (10 mm.) at room temperature for 5 hours, yielding 16–21 g. (39–51%) of product, m.p. 175°, which is of sufficient purity for use in the next step.
C. (−)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-Phenylcyclohexanol. A 500-mL, three-necked Morton flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pH probe (connected to a pH controller,), and a base inlet (connected to a syringe pump regulated by the pH controller and a calibrated 250-mL reservoir of 1 N sodium hydroxide) is charged with 106.0 g (0.419 mol) of racemic trans-2-phenylcyclohexyl chloroacetate, 10 mL of pH 7 buffer, and 90 mL of deionized water. This heterogeneous mixture is rapidly stirred and heated to between 45° and 50°C using a constant temperature bath. The pH is adjusted to 7.5 with 1 N sodium hydroxide and after a steady pH reading is achieved, 1 g of lipase (P. fluorescens,) is added. Immediately 1 N sodium hydroxide begins to flow into the reaction mixture as the pH begins to drop (indicating hydrolysis of the chloroacetate). The pH controller regulates the addition of base so as to maintain the pH between 7.5 and 7.8. After 2 hr, an additional 1.5 g of lipase is added to the reaction mixture and the rate of hydrolysis becomes noticeably faster. After 45 hr, ca. 200 mL (~ 95% of theory) of 1 N sodium hydroxide has been added and the rate of hydrolysis has become very slow. After ca. 50 hr, 210 mL of 1 N sodium hydroxide (0.21 mol, 100% of theory) has been added to the mixture and the rate of base addition has nearly stopped. The mixture is cooled to room temperature and extracted with three 200-mL portions of ether. The organic layer is filtered through a small pad of Celite to remove traces of enzyme emulsion and the Celite is rinsed with three 100-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and after filtration are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (35°C) and finally dried at 0.5 mm for 1 hr to give 93 g of a colorless oil. Fractional crystallization from 100 mL of petroleum ether (30–60°C) at −20°C (freezer) overnight affords 19.8 g (53.5% of theory,) of (−)-(1R,2S)-trans-2-phenylcyclohexanol as colorless needles, mp 63–65°C, [α]D25 −54.3° (methanol, c 18). An additional 15.8 g of the (−) alcohol is obtained by chromatography of the mother liquors (vide infra) to afford a total of 35.6 g (96.2% of theory, and).
A 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and an addition funnel with drying tube. The flask is charged with 100 g (0.4 mol) of Boc-L-leucine hydrate, 458 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 1.8 L of methylene chloride. A clear solution results on stirring, which is cooled to −20° ± 2°C by immersing the flask in a dry ice–2-propanol bath. N-Methylpiperidine, 48.8 mL (0.41 mol), is placed in the addition funnel and added rapidly to the mixture, while the temperature is allowed to rise to −12° ± 2°C. Methyl chloroformate, 31 mL (0.4 mol), is then placed in the addition funnel and added rapidly to the mixture with good stirring, while the temperature is kept at −12° ± 2°C. Two minutes later the solution of N,O-dimethylhydroxylamine, prepared as described earlier, is added. The cooling bath is removed and the clear solution allowed to warm to room temperature over 4 hr. The solution is again cooled to 5°C and extracted with two 500-mL portions of aqueous 0.2 N hydrochloric acid and two 500-mL portions of aqueous 0.5 N sodium hydroxide. The solution is washed with 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator at a bath temperature of 30–35°C. The residue is further evacuated on an oil pump to constant weight. The residual colorless syrup weighs 100–102 g (91–93%), [α]D23 −24 to −25° (1.5% in methanol).
A. 2-(2'-Lithio-4',5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethyl chloride. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, low-temperature thermometer, and a three-way stopcock having a vertically oriented tube capped with a rubber septum and a horizontal tube connected to a source of dry nitrogen and vacuum, is charged with 10.0 g (37.9 mmol) of 2-(2'-bromo-4',5'-methylenedioxyphenyl)ethyl chloride. The assembled apparatus is evacuated and refilled with nitrogen three times. Freshly distilled diethyl ether (200 mL) is added to the flask by means of a double-ended needle (0.5 m in length) inserted through the vertical tube of the stopcock while a slight vacuum is applied to the apparatus. A slightly positive pressure of nitrogen is then maintained in the apparatus throughout the course of the reaction. The solution is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath. The glass jacket (or styrofoam cup), which surrounds the addition funnel, is filled with powdered dry ice, and 33 mL of a 2.3 M solution of tert-butyllithium (76 mmol) in pentane is added to the addition funnel by means of a syringe. After 10 min the lithium reagent is added dropwise to the flask over a period of 1 hr, while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained below −60°C. The solution of the resulting aryllithium reagent 1 is then used in either of the two reactions described below.
A. Ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl)glycinate. A 1-L. three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and two stoppers, is charged with 25 g (0.117 mol) of (1S,2R)-1,2-diphenyl-2-hydroxyethylamine, 29 g (0.176 mol) of ethyl bromoacetate and 455 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF). To the stirred mixture, 24 g (0.234 mol) of triethylamine is added dropwise via the addition funnel. After stirring vigorously for 20 hr at room temperature, the solids are removed by filtration and washed three times with THF. The clear yellowish filtrate and washes are concentrated on a rotary evaporator (to remove solvent, excess triethylamine, and ethyl bromoacetate) to afford an off-white solid, which is collected with a Buchner funnel, then washed with water to dissolve residual salts. The residue is air-dried in the filter funnel with water aspirator vacuum. The crude product is dissolved in 117 mL of boiling absolute ethanol (EtOH) and stored at room temperature overnight. White crystals are collected by filtration, washed with ice-cold (0°C) absolute EtOH carefully, and dried at 50°C. The above described procedure is done in duplicate, providing ethyl (1'S,2'R)-N-(1',2'-diphenyl-2'-hydroxyethyl)glycinate in yields of 29.01 g and 28.96 g, (average yield: 83%).
A. 2-Oxazolidinone. A 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, magnetic stirring bar, and a Vigreux column fitted with a distillation head is charged with 305 g (5.0 mol) of freshly distilled 2-aminoethanol, 730 g (6.2 mol) of diethyl carbonate, and 2.5 g (0.05 mol) of sodium methoxide. The mixture is stirred and the flask is heated in an oil bath maintained at 125–130°C. Ethanol begins to distill off when the internal temperature reaches 95–100°C. After heating for about 8 hr, the internal temperature reaches 125°C and ethanol ceases to distill. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to 60–70°C and is poured into 1 L of cold chloroform. The resulting solution is chilled thoroughly in an ice–water bath and the precipitated product is recovered by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated to 250 mL and chilled to give a second crop. The combined crops are dried in a vacuum oven at 50°C to give 320–339 g (74–78%) of white crystals, mp 86–88°C [lit.2 mp 87–89°C].
The resulting solution (about 9 l.) is divided into two portions and each is extracted three times, 600 ml. of ether being used each time. The combined extracts are concentrated to about 1 l. and dried overnight over 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration and evaporation of the ether, there remains 137–160 g. (58–65%) of a slightly colored product, melting with decomposition at 227–229°. It is sufficiently pure for most purposes and.
D. Triethyl 1,2,4-triazine-3,5,6-tricarboxylate. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a 500-mL addition funnel, and a nitrogen inlet. A solution of ethyl oxalamidrazonate (11.6 g, 88.0 mmol) in absolute ethanol (350 mL) is added dropwise (40–45 mi) to a stirring solution of diethyl dioxosuccinate (23.1 g, 114.0 mmol) in absolute ethanol (86 mL) at 25°C under nitrogen. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred at 25°C (16 hr). A reflux condenser is fitted onto the three-necked, round-bottomed flask and the reaction mixture is warmed at reflux for 2.0 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. Purification of the product is effected by gravity chromatography on a 5.20 × 40.0-cm column of silica gel (10–40% ether–hexane gradient elution), collecting 100-mL fractions. The fractions are analyzed by thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (40% ether–hexane eluant). The fractions containing product are combined and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to afford 14.70 g (56%) of pure triethyl 1,2,4-triazine-3,5,6-tricarboxylate as a viscous, yellow oil2,5.
The main fraction melts at 41–43°, and the other two fractions usually melt about a degree or two lower. The product is pure enough for most purposes; it may be recrystallized from the minimal volume of ethanol necessary for solution at 45–50°. The solution is cooled to about 35°; any oil that precipitates is brought back into solution by cautious addition of ethanol. The saturated solution is seeded, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then kept in a refrigerator for at least 4 hours. In this manner, 20–21 g. of flat, colorless needles is obtained; the product melts at 42–43.5°.
A. (R,R)-trans-β-Methylstyrene oxide.2 A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 5-cm, egg-shaped, Teflon-coated stir bar and two addition funnels is cooled in an ice-bath. The flask is charged with trans-β-methylstyrene (5.91 g, 50.0 mmol), 500 mL of a 2:1 mixture of dimethoxymethane and acetonitrile (CH3CN), 300 mL of potassium carbonate-acetic acid buffer solution, tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate (0.375 g, 1.1 mmol), and the chiral ketone 1 (4.52 g, 17.5 mmol, 35 mol%). One addition funnel is charged with a solution of Oxone (46.1 g, 75.0 mmol) in 170 mL of aqueous 4 × 10−4M disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (Na2EDTA) solution and the other addition funnel is charged with 170 mL of 1.47M aqueous potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution. The two solutions in the addition funnels are added dropwise at the same rate over 2.5 hr to the cooled reaction mixture which is stirred vigorously at 0°C. The resulting suspension is stirred at 0°C for an additional hour and then 250 mL of pentane is added. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 250-mL portions of pentane, and the combined organic phases are dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at 0°C. The resulting oil is loaded onto 50 g of Whatman 60 Å (230-400 mesh) silica gel packed in a 5-cm diameter column. The silica gel is first washed with 200 mL of hexane to remove trace amounts of unreacted olefin, then the product is eluted with 200 mL of 10:1 hexane:ether to afford 6.02-6.31 g (90-94%) of trans-β-methylstyrene oxide.
To a cold (0–5°) solution of 302 g. of potassium hydroxide sticks in 2720 cc. of distilled water is added slowly, with stirring, 96.6 g. (30.8 cc., 0.6 mole) of bromine. This solution is chilled to 0°, and 59.4 g. (0.6 mole) of succinimide (p. 562) is added with hand stirring. The mixture is warmed in a water bath to 55–60°, when it becomes colorless, and is held at that temperature for two hours. After standing overnight at room temperature, it is acidified to Congo red with concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 380 cc., sp. gr. 1.18) and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath under reduced pressure. The residue is treated with 1 l. of warm 95 per cent alcohol; the undissolved potassium bromide is filtered and washed with 150–200 cc. of cold alcohol in small portions. The filtrate and washings are combined and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure, and the residue is extracted with 100 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol. The resulting solution is again evaporated to dryness and the residue finally extracted with 140 cc. of hot absolute alcohol. After distilling the bulk of the alcohol, this extract is diluted with about 200 cc. of distilled water and shaken out twice with 80-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are discarded.
In a 250-ml. two-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a drying tube, a magnetic stirrer, and a heated dropping funnel with a pressure-equalizing side arm are placed 23.1 g. (0.088 mole) of triphenylphosphine, 8.5 g. (0.081 mole) of benzaldehyde, and 10 ml. of anhydrous 2,2'-dimethoxydiethyl ether (diglyme). A solution of 18.3 g. (0.12 mole) of dry sodium chlorodifluoroacetate is prepared by stirring the finely divided salt in 50 ml. of anhydrous diglyme at 70° for about 5 minutes. This warm solution is placed in the dropping funnel which is heated to 60°. The system is purged with dry nitrogen. The solution in the flask is stirred and heated in an oil bath held at 160°, while the contents of the dropping funnel are added dropwise over a period of 1.5–2 hours. The diglyme and product are flash-distilled at 1 mm and a bath temperature of 100° into a receiver cooled with dry ice. The distillate is fractionated through a spinning-band column (18 in. × 6 mm. I.D.); the yield of product collected at a head temperature of 52–54° (40 mm.) is 7.6–8.9 g. (67–79%), n20D 1.4939.
In a high-pressure autoclave, arranged for agitation by shaking or rocking, are placed 286 g. (336 ml., 4.08 moles) of crotonaldehyde, 294 g. (5.06 moles) of methyl vinyl ether, and 1.1 g. of hydroquinone and. The autoclave is heated to 200° and held there for 12 hours. The autoclave is cooled and vented, and the black product is distilled through a 1 by 60 cm. helix-packed column. The yield of 3,4-dihydro-2-methoxy-4-methyl-2H-pyran is 270–297 g. (52–57%), b.p. 42–50° /19 mm., n25D 1.4349–1.4374,, and.
In a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer is placed 78 g. (70 ml., 1 mole) of 2-mercaptoethanol. Into the dropping funnel is poured 67 ml. (54.3 g., 1 mole) of acrylonitrile, and after the addition of about 3 ml. of the nitrile, with stirring, the contents are warmed with a water bath to about 35–40° for 5 minutes. The remainder of the acrylonitrile is then added dropwise during 10 minutes. The temperature soon mounts to about 65° and is kept between 55° and 60° by intermittent short cooling with water until it only slowly increases or remains stationary at 55–60°. Forty milliliters of acrylonitrile is then added all at once, cooling being applied if necessary, and the contents are stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. The product is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask after removal of excess acrylonitrile under reduced pressure. The yield of nitrile distilling at 178–180°/14 mm., n25D 1.5101, as a colorless viscous liquid is 121–123 g. (92–94%).
If the ketene is not to be used at once, drying tubes should be attached to the trap, which should then be stored at −80°. Ketene can be kept for as long as 2 weeks in this way, although some transformation to high-boiling material occurs. However, pure ketene can be readily obtained from a partially decomposed mixture by simple distillation from the trap and. Caution! Do not store ketene under pressure, as an explosion may result.
In a 5-l. flask, provided with a reflux condenser and an S-tube attached to a dropping funnel, are placed 2 kg. (2.3 l., 25.6 moles) of benzene, which has been dried by distilling until the distillate comes over clear, and 10 g. of amalgamated aluminum turnings. The benzene is heated to boiling on a steam bath, the steam is turned off, and 500 g. (3.96 moles) of benzyl chloride is added at such a rate as to cause the solution to boil. The hydrogen chloride is absorbed in water or allowed to pass out-of-doors. When all the benzyl chloride has been added (one hour), the mixture is warmed for ten to fifteen minutes, or until the evolution of hydrogen chloride ceases. When cool, the benzene solution of diphenylmethane is decanted from the small amount of tarry material and washed with 5 per cent sodium hydroxide solution and then with water. After a partial drying with calcium chloride, the benzene is distilled from a steam bath and the residue fractionated under diminished pressure. The fore-run is collected up to 125°/10 mm., the main product at 125–130°/10 mm., and an after-run up to 150°/10 mm.. Redistillation of the fore-run and after-run yields a small amount of material which is added to the main fraction. The latter is chilled and a small amount of oil is decanted from the crystals. The yield of material melting at 24–25° is 330–350 g. (49.5–52.5 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A mixture of 98 g. (1 mole) of maleic anhydride, m.p. 52–54°, 230 g. of commercial phthaloyl chloride, and 2 g. of anhydrous zinc chloride is placed in a 500-ml. three-necked round-bottomed flask.

The mixture is heated under reflux for 1 hour, cooled, then neutralized, and finally made basic with 15% potassium hydroxide solution. The lower layer of N-ethyl-p-chloroaniline is separated, and the aqueous layer is saturated with potassium carbonate and extracted with two 200-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined with the bulk of the product, washed with two 100-ml. portions of water, and then dried over calcium chloride. After the ether has been removed by distillation, the residue is distilled at reduced pressure from a 125-ml. Claisen flask. N-Ethyl-p-chloroaniline is collected at 108–110°/5 mm. or 149–150°/40 mm., nD25 1.5650–1.5661, weight 52–55 g. (87–92%).
To the distillate, consisting of a yellow oil with a small lower water layer, powdered sodium carbonate (about 10 g.) is added, and the mixture is shaken until the water layer is alkaline and nearly saturated. The layers are separated, and the oil is refluxed for about sixteen hours with 20 g. of powdered potassium carbonate and 5 cc. of water. The oily layer is again separated and dried over about 6 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride or potassium carbonate. It is then placed in a flask containing 2 g. of dry sodium carbonate and distilled through an efficient column. The yield of methyl isopropyl ketone boiling at 92–94° is about 102 g. (59 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is slightly yellow.
The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath and slowly poured into 1 l. of 10 per cent acetic acid cooled to 0° (ice-salt mixture). The toluene layer is separated, washed once with water, twice with cooled 7 per cent sodium carbonate solution, and again with water. The toluene is removed by distillation at ordinary pressure, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield is 115–127 g. (74–81 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product boiling at 83–88°/5 mm. or 79–84°/3 mm. and.
A. Preparation of 2-Pyridyltriolborate. A three-necked, 500-mL round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer (PTFE blade, 15 × 46 mm), a Claisen adapter with an internal thermometer and pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a reflux condenser to which a nitrogen inlet and an oil bubbler are attached, and the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. The flask is charged with 300 mL of THF and 2-bromopyridine (1) (9.7 mL, 100 mmol). The mixture is cooled to -78 °C and 40.0 mL of n-butyllithium solution (2.5 M in hexane, 100 mmol) is added dropwise at a rate of 1 mL/min using the addition funnel. The mixture is stirred for 45 min while maintaining the internal temperature at -78 °C. Triisopropylborate (23 mL, 100 mmol) is then added using the additional funnel (2 mL/min). The mixture is stirred for 1 h at -78 °C and then is allowed to warm to room temperature. The Claisen adapter is removed, and 1,1,1-tris(hydroxymethyl)ethane (12 g, 100 mmol) is added in one portion. The neck is tightly sealed with a glass stopper. The mixture is refluxed for 0.5 h and is cooled to room temperature. The mixture is poured into 1 L of hexanes. The solid product is isolated by filtration through a 17G3 fritted-glass funnel (Iwaki Glass, Co.), washed with hexanes (100 mL) and dried under vacuum to afford 19.8 g (93%) of 2-pyridyltriolborate (2) as a white solid, which is used in step B without purification.
If a dry solution of diazomethane is required, the ether solution is allowed to stand for three hours over pellets of pure potassium hydroxide. For extremely dry solutions, further drying is effected with sodium wire.
This product is light brown and melts at 75–80°. After one recrystallization from petroleum ether the melting point is 80–81°.
The crude carbanilide (symmetrical diphenylurea) is practically pure, and may be obtained in large colorless needles melting at 235° by recrystallization from alcohol with the use of decolorizing carbon; 1 l. of alcohol is required for every 25 g. of product. The weight of the crude carbanilide is 122–128 g. (38–40 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. Trihexylborane. A dry, 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which is attached a rubber septum cap, and a three-way, parallel sidearm connecting tube fitted with a thermometer and an inlet tube (containing a stopcock), permitting introduction of a dry nitrogen atmosphere. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 27.8 g. (0.331 mole) of 1-hexene and 150 ml. of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran with a hypodermic syringe, and 103 ml. (0.110 mole) of a 1.07 M solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran is added dropwise over a 20-minute period to the stirred solution, while the reaction temperature is maintained below ca. 20° with an ice bath. After the addition, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional one hour at room temperature. The resulting solution of trihexylborane is ready for use in the next step.
A. Active calcium. Freshly cut lithium (41.7 mg, 6.01 mmol) and biphenyl (1.020 g, 6.61 mmol) in freshly distilled tetrahydrofuran (THF, 15 mL) are vigorously stirred at room temperature under argon until the lithium is completely consumed (approx. 2 hr). The preformed lithium biphenylide is transferred via a cannula at room temperature to a well-dispersed suspension of calcium bromide (CaBr2, 1.213 g, 6.07 mmol) in freshly distilled THF (15 mL). The reaction mixture is stirred for 1 hr at room temperature prior to use.
The oil bath is heated to 170° and maintained at that temperature for six hours during which time ammonia gas is passed through at the rate of three to four bubbles per second. After the mixture has cooled, the solid is broken up by means of a glass rod and mixed with 100 cc. of water; the mixture is then heated to boiling and filtered while hot. The residue is dissolved in 500 cc. of boiling alcohol, and water is added (about 150 cc.) until the solution becomes turbid. Heat is applied until the turbidity disappears and then the solution is allowed to cool. After standing overnight, the crystals are filtered and dried. The yield is 31–35 g. (68–76 per cent of the theoretical amount) of 2,4-dinitroaniline, melting at 175–177° and. For further purification the product is recrystallized in the same manner from alcohol and water, using 20 cc. of alcohol per gram of solid. Ninety per cent of the crude material is recovered as recrystallized product melting sharply at 180°.
A. Geraniol trichloroacetimidate (1). A dry, 250-ml., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a nitrogen inlet tube. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen and charged with 410 mg. (0.0103 mole) of sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil and 15 ml. of hexane. The suspension is stirred, and the hydride is allowed to settle. The hexane is removed with a long dropping pipette, 60 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether is added, and a solution of 15.4 g. (0.0993 mole) of geraniol in 15 ml. of anhydrous ether is added over 5 minutes. After the evolution of hydrogen ceases (less than 5 minutes), the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 15 minutes. The clear solution is then cooled to between −10 and 0° in an ice–salt bath. Trichloroacetonitrile (10.0 ml., 14.4 g., 0.0996 mole) is added dropwise to the stirred solution, while the reaction temperature is maintained below 0°. Addition is completed within 15 minutes, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature. The light amber mixture is poured into a 250-ml., round-bottomed flask, and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator. Pentane [150 ml., containing 0.4 ml. (0.01 mole) of methanol] is added, the mixture is shaken vigorously for 1 minute, and a small amount of dark, insoluble material is removed by gravity filtration. The residue is washed two times with pentane (50 ml. total), and the combined filtrate is concentrated with a rotary evaporator, yielding 27–29 g. (90–97%) of nearly pure imidate 1.
One kilogram of dry finely ground vegetable ivory waste is added gradually to 1250 g. of 85 per cent sulfuric acid in an 8-l. (2-gallon) enameled vessel at such a rate as to keep the temperature at 30–35° (one to two hours). The mass is well kneaded and then kept at about 25° for fifteen hours. A mixture of 1 l. of acetone-free methyl alcohol and 250 cc. of pure concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is kneaded into the soft mass, which is then transferred to a 12-l. flask. The flask is adjusted on a large steam bath; 6 l. of absolute methyl alcohol is added; and the mixture is refluxed eight hours.
A. 3-Ethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-5-methylisoxazole. A slurry of lithium aluminum hydride (21.0 g., 0.553 mole) in anhydrous diethyl ether is prepared by cautiously adding the powdered reagent to 2.5 l. of freshly prepared anhydrous ether in a 5-l., three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a 500-ml. pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and a strong mechanical stirrer. The contents of the flask are then placed under a nitrogen atmosphere via a gas-inlet tube attached to the top of the condenser. Ethyl 3-ethyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolecarboxylate (124 g., 0.678 mole), dissolved in 300 ml. of dry ether, is placed in the addition funnel and added dropwise over 4 hours to the lithium aluminum hydride slurry. The reaction is refluxed gently for 4 hours, then placed in an ice bath. Quenching of excess reagent and hydrolysis of aluminate salts is effected by cautious, slow addition of 20 ml. of water, followed by 30 ml. of aqueous 10% sodium hydroxide and another 30 ml. of water. The ether layer is filtered from granular aluminum salts, poured into a 2-l. separatory funnel, and washed with 250 ml. of saturated brine. The organic extract is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and filtered, and the solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator. The residual oil is distilled, yielding 76–82 g. (80–86%) of 3-ethyl-4-hydroxymethyl-5-methylisoxazole, b.p. 99–101° (0.15 mm.); nD23 1.4835; IR: 3450, 1640 cm.−1; 1H NMR (CCl4): δ 1.2 (t, 3H, CH2CH3), 2.2 (s, 3H, C=CCH3), 2.6 (q, 2H, CH2CH3), 4.2 (s, 2H, CH2O).
The triazine is purified by recrystallizing it from 250 ml. of dioxane, using 2 g. of decolorizing carbon and filtering hot. The recrystallized triazine is dried for 5 hours at 60° (1–5 mm. pressure) in a vacuum oven. It then weighs 31–33 g. (44–47%), m.p. 142–143°.
When all the apparatus has been set up and tested the flask is connected to the reaction assembly, and 175 ml. of water, 105 g. (0.38 mole) of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate, 0.5 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, and 6 g. (0.04 mole) of o-nitrobenzaldehyde (see p. 641) are introduced in the order given. The stirrer is then started, and the flask is heated by means of the steam bath. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 90°, 25 ml. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide is added in one portion, and at 2-minute intervals three 10-ml. portions of ammonium hydroxide are added. Stirring and heating are continued throughout. The total reaction time is 8–10 minutes.

A 200-ml., three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a heating mantle, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a glass stopper, and a continuous water separator (a Dean-Stark trap,) fitted with a condenser and a nitrogen inlet tube. The reaction vessel is flushed with nitrogen, and 61.5 g. (0.853 mole) of isobutyraldehyde is added to the reaction flask. An additional amount of isobutyraldehyde is added to the continuous water separator, filling the water-collecting trap. A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout the reaction and distillation. To the reaction flask is added, dropwise and with stirring over 5 minutes, 60.6 g. (0.852 mole) of pyrrolidine. After addition is complete, the dropping funnel is replaced with a glass stopper and the reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for 3.5 hours during which time about 15 ml. (0.83 mole) of water collects in the water separator. The water separator and condenser are replaced with a distillation head, and the reaction mixture is distilled under reduced pressure, yielding 99.1–100.7 g. (94–95%) of the enamine as a colorless liquid, b.p. 92–106° (115–118 mm.), n25D 1.4708–1.4738.
A 500-mL, two-necked flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and a drying tube, is charged with 240 mL of anhydrous ethanol. The solvent is preheated to 70°C and a 12-g portion of this finely powdered dry product is added all at once. The resulting suspension is refluxed for 2–3 min when almost all of the solid has dissolved. The hot solution is filtered as quickly as possible through a sintered-glass funnel (porosity 3) and the filtrate is chilled to 0°C for 30 min. Isolation of the crystalline deposit and washing with 20 mL of ether provides 7.8 g of pure product. Recrystallization of three 12-g portions furnishes 23.4 g (44%) of O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine, mp >140°C, with decomposition.
The reaction mixture is then heated at reflux for 3.5 hr and allowed to cool to 25°C. The benzene is removed at 25°C on a rotary evaporator to afford a dark-brown oil. This was diluted with 50 mL of ether, filtered through a 3-cm × 14-cm column of silica gel, and eluted with an additional 175 mL of ether. Removal of the ether under reduced pressure yields ca. 21 g of an oily orange solid that consists of a mixture of diastereomeric 1-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-3-methylcyclopropanes.
In a 12-l. round-bottomed flask, arranged so that the contents can be mechanically stirred, is placed 4600 g. (5750 cc., 79 moles) of technical acetone. The flask is then well cooled with an ice and salt mixture, until the temperature of the acetone is between 0° and 5°. Stirring is started, and 4160 cc. of commercial concentrated sulfuric acid is run in at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture never rises above about 10°. This addition is accomplished in about five to ten hours. The stirring is continued for three to four hours longer, while the flask still remains immersed in the original freezing mixture to which no further amount of ice is added. The mixture is then allowed to stand at room temperature for eighteen to twenty-four hours.
2. This compound is commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Inc. Alternatively, it can be made very cheaply and simply by mixing benzyl chloride (1 equiv) with triethylamine (2.5 equiv). The mixture is allowed to stand for 4–7 days at room temperature. Filtration of the solid and drying in vacuum give triethylbenzylammonium chloride suitable for use in nearly quantitative yield.
A solution of 600 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride in 1.8 l. of water warmed to 40° is added slowly with rapid mixing to the hot sodium malonate solution. A cheese-like precipitate of calcium malonate is formed immediately and becomes coarsely crystalline on standing for twenty-four hours. After the supernatant solution is decanted, the calcium malonate is washed by decantation four or five times with 500-cc. portions of cold water. It is then transferred to a filter, sucked as dry as possible, and dried in the air, or at 45–50°, to constant weight. The yield is 800–900 g.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a separatory funnel, are placed 615 g. (3.3 moles) of ethylene dibromide, 1250 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, and 450 cc. of water. The stirrer is started and the mixture heated to boiling. To the well-stirred boiling mixture a solution of 125 g. (1 mole) of anhydrous sodium sulfite in 450 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel over a period of about two hours. The solution is boiled under a reflux condenser for two hours after all the sulfite solution has been added. The condenser is then set for distillation, and the alcohol and the ethylene bromide are distilled. The remaining water solution is poured into a large evaporating dish and evaporated to dryness on the water bath. The sodium 2-bromoethanesulfonate is extracted from the sodium bromide and unchanged sodium sulfite with 2 l. of boiling 95 per cent alcohol. On cooling the solution, most of the salt crystallizes; the mother liquor is used for a second extraction of the residue. The yield is 165–190 g. (78–90 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product may be further purified by recrystallizing from alcohol and drying in an oven at 110°. The recovery on recrystallization is 75–80 per cent.
This procedure should be conducted in a good hood. The slurry is stirred while being heated on a steam bath, and solid sodium hydrosulfite is added until the red color of the nitroso compound is completely bleached. Then an additional 30 g. of sodium hydrosulfite is added; the light tan suspension is stirred with heating for 15 minutes more and is allowed to cool. The dense diaminouracil bisulfite is filtered from the cooled solution, washed well with water, and partially dried.
OPTICAL PURITY ENHANCEMENT. A 1-L, three-necked flask equipped as described above is charged with 28.4 g (0.175 mol) of ethyl (S)-2-fluorohexanoate (81% ee), 300 mL of deionized water and 300 mL of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The pH is adjusted to 7.0 with a few drops of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution and 36 mg of Pseudomonas lipase enzyme (P-30, Amano International) is added to the mixture. The hydrolysis is allowed to proceed at 5°C. The pH is kept at 7.0 by adding adequate 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution via the syringe pump. The hydrolysis is discontinued when 131.3 mL (75% conversion) of 1 N aqueous sodium hydroxide solution has been added (total reaction time: 4 hr). The mixture is quickly extracted with ethyl ether (3 × 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and concentrated at 35°C/70 mm to provide 5.66 g of nearly racemic ethyl 2-fluorohexanoate. The aqueous phase is acidified to pH 2.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl ether (4 × 500 mL). The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated at 35°C/70 mm to give 16.8 g (71% yield; 95.5% of theory) of (S)-2-fluorohexanoic acid. This acid is distilled at 67°C/0.4–0.5 mm to give 14.2 g of enantiomerically pure (S)-2-fluorohexanoic acid as a colorless oil: [α]D25 −13.8° (CHCl3, c 1.7) and.
After six to seven hours, the temperature at the head of the column begins to rise above 95° and finally reaches 98°, at which point practically no more guaiacol passes over with the distillate. This requires about one hour more, after which the heating is stopped. The increase in weight of the absorption bottle amounts to 400–500 g. (57–72 per cent of the theoretical amount of methyl bromide); the water collected weighs 550–560 g..
Thirty milliliters of a solution of sodium isopropoxide, prepared from 1 g. of sodium and 100 ml. of isopropyl alcohol, is placed in a 250-ml. Claisen flask arranged for heating in a water bath. The flask is provided with a dropping funnel, a condenser, and a receiver cooled in a Dry Ice bath; this receiver is connected to a second one containing 20 ml. of anhydrous ether; the inlet tube of the second receiver should dip below the surface of the ether.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer for reading low temperatures is placed 790 ml. (7 moles) of 48% hydrobromic acid. The flask and contents are cooled to 10–20° in an ice-salt bath, and 150 g. (1.59 moles) of 2-aminopyridine is added over a period of about 10 minutes. While the temperature is kept at 0° or lower, 240 ml. (4.7 moles) of bromine is added dropwise. A solution of 275 g. (4 moles) of sodium nitrite in 400 ml. of water is added dropwise over a period of 2 hours, the temperature being carefully maintained at 0° or lower. After an additional 30 minutes of stirring, a solution of 600 g. (15 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 600 ml. of water is added at such a rate that the temperature does not rise above 20–25°. The nearly colorless reaction mixture is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. The extract is dried for 1 hour over 100 g. of solid potassium hydroxide and is then distilled through a Vigreux column 15 cm. in length. 2-Bromopyridine distils at 74–75°/13 mm., and the yield is 216–230 g. (86–92%).
A. 2,4,4,6-Tetrabromo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one. A mixture of 66.2 g. (0.200 mole) of 2,4,6-tribromophenol, 27.2 g. (0.197 mole) of sodium acetate trihydrate, and 400 ml. of glacial acetic acid is placed in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask and warmed (ca. 70°) until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is magnetically stirred and cooled to room temperature to produce a finely divided suspension of the phenol, to which a solution of 32 g. (0.20 mole) of bromine in 200 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise over 1 hour. The resulting mixture is kept at room temperature for 30 minutes, then poured onto 2 kg. of crushed ice. The yellow solid which separates is removed by suction filtration after the ice has melted, and the damp crystals are dissolved in the minimum of warm chloroform. The upper aqueous layer is removed with a pipet fitted with a suction bulb. The dienone crystallizes from the chloroform solution upon cooling, yielding 50–55 g. (61–67%) of crystals, m.p. 125–130° (dec.), sufficiently pure for use in the next step and.
Before finally assembling the apparatus, the various units are charged as follows: A is one-third filled with water to serve as a bubble counter. Generator B is about one-quarter filled with dry arsenious oxide, pea size or powdered. Drying towers G and H are filled with anhydrous calcium chloride. (It is well to place a wad of glass wool in front of the entrance and exit tubes.) In each of the two absorption bottles, J and K, is placed 200 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl malonate. Dish L is filled with an ice-salt freezing mixture.
(Caution: The final washings must be alkaline to avoid the liberation of hydrogen cyanide in the subsequent step.) The organic layer is washed twice with 500 mL of 10% aqueous sodium cyanide solution, once with 500 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and twice with 500 mL of water.
The concentrated mixture is diluted with degassed toluene (200 mL) and filtered through a pad of silica gel with toluene as eluent. The vermilion filtrate is collected into a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and concentrated on a rotary evaporator under reduced pressure (10 mmHg) at 40 °C. To remove 1,2-dichlorobenzene the bath temperature is raised to 80 °C until solid just begins to appear on the inside wall of the flask. Nitrogen is added while the vacuum is broken, and the flask is removed from the rotary evaporator. Degassed methanol is added gently against the inside wall of the flask. As methanol mixes with the product, the solution becomes cloudy and a precipitate forms. The addition is continued until precipitation is complete. The total amount of methanol required is approximately 400 mL. The precipitate is collected by filtration on a Buchner funnel and washed with methanol (5 × 10 mL) and hexane (3 × 10 mL). The product is dried under reduced pressure (1 mmHg) for 12 h at room temperature to obtain red microcrystals of the title compound (2.08 g, 2.61 mmol) in 94% overall yield and 91% purity (determined by HPLC analysis). The product can be used as is for further transformations, or it can be purified by preparative HPLC.
B. 4,4'-Dimethyl-1,1'-biphenyl. A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser protected by a drying tube, a mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer, and a gas-inlet tube is charged with 101 g. (0.356 mole) of thallium(I) bromide and 400 ml. of anhydrous benzene. The slurry is stirred vigorously while a stream of dry nitrogen is passed through the apparatus. The reflux condenser is temporarily removed, and the solution of (4-methylphenyl)magnesium bromide is added to the flask as rapidly as possible through a large filter funnel fitted with a loose plug of glass wool. A black solid precipitates almost immediately from solution. The reflux condenser is replaced, and the contents of the flask are refluxed with stirring for 4 hours under a nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture is then cooled, filtered, and the metallic thallium washed with 200 ml. of diethyl ether. The organic layer is washed once with 100 ml. of 0.1 N hydrochloric acid and once with 100 ml. of water, then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate.
A 2-l. round-bottomed flask having standard-taper, ground-glass fittings is equipped with a bulb condenser and an efficient Hershberg stirrer. To this are added with stirring 600 g. (2.0 moles) of 33% sulfuric acid, 20 g. (0.06 mole) of finely divided 1,5-naphthalenedisulfonyl chloride (p. 693 ), and 100 g. (1.5 g. atoms) of zinc dust amalgam at room temperature. The zinc dust amalgam is added directly after the disulfonyl chloride in the course of 2–5 minutes. The mixture is heated to reflux, held there for about 6 hours, and allowed to cool overnight without agitation.
The mother liquor and the filtrate from the first resolution (see above) are combined and concentrated to dryness to give 9.0 g of solid material ((R)-BINAPO and (−)-DBT) after being dried at 80°C (0.05 mm) for 3 hr, mp 228–230°C (dec). This solid is treated with 150 mL of 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and extracted with two 150-mL portions of chloroform. The combined extract is washed with 70 mL of 0.75 N sodium hydroxide, two 100-mL portions of water, and dried over sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is evaporated to give 7.7 g of colorless solid, which is dried at 80°C overnight to afford 5.9 g (9.0 mmol) of crude (R)-BINAPO, mp 249–251°C, [α]D20 +304° (benzene, c 0.522). This recovered (R)-BINAPO is dissolved in 350 mL of refluxing chloroform, and to this added is added with stirring a solution of 3.4 g (9.0 mmol) of (+)-DBT monohydrate in 280 mL of warm ethyl acetate. The mixture is stirred at reflux temperature for 5 min and then allowed to stand at room temperature overnight. The white precipitates are collected on a sintered-glass funnel, washed with two 20-mL portions of cold ethyl acetate, and dried at 70°C (0.05 mm) for 12 hr to give 7.5 g [92% yield based on the initially used (R)-BINAPO] of the (R)-BINAPO-(+)-DBT-complex, mp 235–236°C (dec), [α]D25 +172° (ethanol, c 0.527).
The resulting rather stiff paste is chilled in an ice-water mixture for 1 hour. The solid is collected on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with 25-ml. portions of absolute ethanol until it is white and until the filtrate becomes colorless (100–200 ml. of ethanol is required). The fluffy material, after it is dried in a vacuum desiccator over flake sodium hydroxide, weighs 66 g. (40%).
B. t-Butyl azodiformate. In a 500-ml. Erlenmeyer flask is placed a solution of 23.2 g. (0.1 mole) of crude t-butyl hydrazodiformate (m.p. 124–126°) in 175 ml. of methylene chloride and 7.9 g. (0.1 mole) of pyridine. The solution is cooled by a stream of running tap water while 18.2 g. (0.102 mole) of N-bromosuccinimide is added during 6–7 minutes with swirling. The resulting solution is allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 minutes and is washed with two 100-ml. portions of water followed by one 100-ml. portion of 10% sodium hydroxide. The solution is dried for 30 minutes over magnesium sulfate, filtered into a large evaporating dish, and allowed to evaporate. The yellow-orange crystalline residue, m.p. 90–91.5°, which amounts to 20.7–21.8 g. (90–94.5%), is recrystallized by covering the dry solid with 35–40 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 30–60°) and adding ligroin (b.p. 60–90°) to the boiling solution until the solid dissolves. t-Butyl azodiformate, 19.8–20.0 g., m.p. 90.7–92°, separates from the cooled solution as large lemon-yellow crystals. Evaporation of the filtrate gives an additional amount of yellow solid which is recrystallized as before, yielding 0.4–0.7 g. of pure material, m.p. 90–92°. The total yield is 20.2–20.7 g. (88–90%).
To the salt and 200 ml. of water in a 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with an efficient magnetic stirrer and cooled in ice is added 400 ml. of 50% sodium hydroxide solution. The resulting mixture is continuously extracted with tetrahydrofuran for 4 days. The extract is concentrated to dryness at reduced pressure, and 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaäzacycloöctadecane (6) is recrystallized from acetonitrile (30 ml. per g.), giving 19–22 g. (49–50%) of long, white needles, m.p. 147–150°.
The crude product is dissolved in five times its weight of water, and, after clearing with a little Norite, the solution is diluted with one and one-half volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. The product separates in well-formed, snow-white crystals, and after standing for several days in an ice chest is collected with suction on a Büchner funnel. The yield of purified histidine monohydrochloride is 75–80 g.. The compound melts at 251–252°, with decomposition. The amino acid is not racemized by the procedure employed, and it shows the characteristic optical activity, [α]D26° = +8.0°, in the presence of three moles of hydrochloric acid. The recrystallized product is usually analytically pure and shows the correct Van Slyke amino nitrogen content. Occasionally a second recrystallization is necessary to obtain analytically pure material.
A. 2,3-Dihydro-5-furyllithium . A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and a nitrogen inlet is charged with a solution of 2,3-dihydrofuran (3.15 g, 3.4 mL, 45 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 6.13 g, 6.9 mL, 90 mmol). The magnetically stirred solution is cooled in a liquid nitrogen-ethyl acetate cooling bath to an internal temperature of −85°C whereupon tert-butyllithium (26.5 mL, 45 mmol, 1.7 M solution in pentane) is added dropwise via a syringe during 10 min. After the addition the yellow semi-solid mixture is placed in an ice bath, stirred at 0-3°C for 30 min and diluted with 20 mL of diethyl ether to give a thick yellow suspension of 2,3-dihydro-5-furyllithium .2
The solid is separated by filtration and the filtrate is extracted with three 150-ml. portions of ether. (Caution! Gloves should be worn when handling this solution because of the large amount of cyanide it contains.) The solid is dissolved in ether and this solution is combined with the extracts. The combined ethereal solutions are washed with water and dried over 5 g. of sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent by distillation leaves crude ferrocenylacetonitrile as a solid or as an oil that crystallizes on being scratched. The nitrile is dissolved in about 200 ml. of boiling technical grade hexane. The hot solution is decanted from a small amount of insoluble black tar and is cooled to room temperature. Ferrocenylacetonitrile is deposited as bright yellow crystals, m.p. 79–82°. The yield of the nitrile is 24–26 g. (71–77%).
A. 2-Pyrrolyl trichloromethyl ketone. A 3-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser with a calcium chloride drying tube is charged with 225 g. (1.23 moles) of trichloroacetyl chloride and 200 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether. The solution is stirred while 77 g. (1.2 moles) of freshly distilled pyrrole in 640 ml. of anhydrous ether is added over 3 hours; the heat of reaction causes the mixture to reflux. Following the addition, the mixture is stirred for 1 hour before 100 g. (0.724 mole) of potassium carbonate in 300 ml. of water is slowly added through the dropping funnel. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is dried with magnesium sulfate, treated with 6 g. of Norit, and filtered. The solvent is removed by distillation on a steam bath, and the residue is dissolved in 225 ml. of hexane. The dark solution is cooled on ice to induce crystallation. The tan solid is collected and washed with 100 ml. of cold hexane, giving 189–196 g. (77–80%) of the ketone, m.p. 73–75°.
A. 1,2-Bis(trimethylsilyloxy)cyclobutene. Method 1. A 1-l., three-necked, creased flask is fitted with a stirrer capable of forming a fine dispersion of molten sodium, a reflux condenser, and a Hershberg addition funnel and maintained under an oxygen-free, nitrogen atmosphere. The flask is charged with 250–300 ml. of dry solvent and 9.6–9.8 g. (~0.4 g.-atom) of freshly cut sodium,. The solvent is brought to gentle reflux, and the stirrer is operated at full speed until the sodium is fully dispersed. The stirrer speed is then reduced, and a mixture of 17.4 g. (0.100 mole) of diethyl succinate and 45–50 g. (~0.4 mole) of chlorotrimethylsilane in 125 ml. of solvent is added over 1–3 hours. The reaction is exothermic, and a dark purple precipitate appears within a few minutes. The solvent is maintained at reflux during and after the addition. After five hours of additional stirring, the contents of the flask are cooled and filtered through a 75-mm., coarse sintered-disk funnel in a nitrogen dry-box. The precipitate is washed several times with anhydrous diethyl ether or petroleum ether.
The crude product is dissolved in benzene-hexane (1:1) and applied to a column containing 125 g. of silicic acid. Elution with the same solvent gives traces (less than 5 mg. each) of the two fast-moving components in fractions 2 and 4 (125-ml. fractions) and chromatographically pure cholane-24-al in fractions 5–8. Evaporation of the pooled fractions yields 870 mg. (84%) of the pure crystalline aldehyde, m.p. 102–104°. Recrystallization from 5 ml. of acetone raises the melting point to 103–104°.
The crude naphthoquinone is precipitated by pouring the reaction mixture into 6 l. of water. The yellow precipitate is filtered, washed with 200 ml. of water, and dried in a desiccator. The product can be crystallized from 500 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 80–100°) and separates in the form of long yellow needles, m.p. 124–125°. The yield is 14–17 g. (18–22%).
The reaction mixture is cooled and treated carefully with 750 cc. of chilled 6 per cent hydrochloric acid. The contents of the flask are kept cool by the occasional addition of ice while the acid is being introduced. As soon as all the solid has dissolved, the upper oily layer of hexaldehyde acetal is separated. The acetal is hydrolyzed by distilling it with a solution of 100 g. (55 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 700 cc. of water. The free aldehyde distils rapidly, and the distillation is complete when a sample of fresh distillate contains 5 per cent or less of immiscible oil. The distillate is collected in a solution of 100 g. (1 mole) of sodium bisulfite in 300 cc. of water. The mixture is shaken vigorously for several minutes; the oily layer remaining undissolved in the bisulfite solution is principally n-amyl alcohol and is discarded. To remove the remainder of the amyl alcohol and other impurities the bisulfite solution is steam-distilled until 200 cc. of distillate has been collected.
Drying under reduced pressure yields 39.1–43.1 g.. (72–80%) of crude, crystalline ε-benzoylamino-α-chlorocaproic acid, m.p. 138–140°. The product is dissolved in 320 ml. of hot 95% ethanol, 480 ml. of boiling water is added, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool slowly. The crystals are collected, washed with cold water, and dried, yielding 26.1–28.2 g. (48–52%) of pure ε-benzoylamino-α-chlorocaproic acid, m.p. 143–144°.
A 250 mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a rubber septum and gas inlet, is flame-dried under vacuum, filled with argon, and charged with a solution of diisopropyl squarate (5.94 g, 30 mmol) in dry tetrahydrofuran (150 mL). The solution is cooled to −78°C and cannulated rapidly into the reaction flask. After completion of the addition, the mixture is stirred for 2 hr at 0°C, then for an additional 15 hr at room temperature. Following recooling to 0°C, 180 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution is added via syringe, the ice bath is removed, and stirring is continued for an additional 7 hr.
A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and gas-outlet tube is charged with 470 g. (255 ml., 4.8 moles) of 96% sulfuric acid, 100 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, and 13.6 g. (0.100 mole) of adamantane.2 The well-stirred mixture is cooled to 17–19° in an ice bath, and 1 ml. of 98% formic acid is added. Then a solution of 29.6 g. (38 ml., 0.40 mole) of t-butyl alcohol in 55 g. (1.2 moles) of 98–100% formic acid is added dropwise; the rate of addition and the cooling are regulated so that the addition requires 1–2 hours, and the temperature of the reaction mixture is kept at 17–25°. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes and poured onto 700 g. of crushed ice. The layers are separated, and the upper, acid layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of carbon tetrachloride.
In a 12-l. earthenware crock equipped with an efficient stirrer and a strong motor are placed 375 g. (2.5 moles) of mandelic acid (p. 336) and 500 cc. of water. The stirrer is started, and a cool solution of 110 g. (2.8 moles) of sodium hydroxide (or 115 g. of technical sodium hydroxide) in 500 cc. of water is added. This is followed by the addition of 2000 g. of cracked ice and then after a few minutes by 275 g. (1.74 moles) of finely ground u.s.p. potassium permanganate in portions over a period of one-half hour. The mixture is stirred for one and one-half hours, the temperature being maintained at −2° to −4°. About 5 kg. of ice is necessary. At the end of one and one-half hours the mixture is tested for excess permanganate by placing a drop on a piece of filter paper; a black or brown center of manganese dioxide is formed, a greenish ring around this, and an outer ring which is colorless in the absence and pink in the presence of excess permanganate. Any excess is removed by adding ethyl alcohol, generally about 200–300 cc.
A 2-l. round-bottomed flask, surrounded by an ice-water bath and provided with a stirrer, a separatory funnel, and an outlet tube, is set up in a good hood. To the flask are added 500 g. (160 cc., 3.1 moles) of bromine and 50 cc. of water. To the stirred mixture is added gradually a solution of 170 g. of sodium cyanide (3.5 moles) in 1.2 l. of warm water. The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 30°. When the reaction is complete (about two hours or less) the cyanogen bromide is distilled from a steam bath, using a 500-cc. flask as a receiver. The distillate is warmed with about 100 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride, filtered, and again distilled, preferably with the distilling flask used as a receiving vessel connected directly to the flask from which the cyanogen bromide is being distilled. The product boils at 60–62°. It is melted in the receiver (Hood) and poured into a warm tared bottle. The yield of white crystalline solid melting at 49–51° is 239–280 g. (73–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. [3-(Dimethylamino)-2-azaprop-2-en-1-ylidene]dimethylammonium chloride. A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a Claisen adapter, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and mineral oil bubbler. The flask is charged with cyanuric chloride (73.8 g, 0.4 mol), N,N-dimethylformamide (175.4 g, 2.4 mol), and 1,4-dioxane (100 mL). The resulting solution is stirred and heated (at approximately 85°C) for 2–3 hr while a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is evolved. When gas evolution is minimal, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature; the product rapidly solidifies. The flask that contains the solid product is connected to an isopropyl alcohol–dry ice trap and the solvent is removed by evacuating the system to approximately 0.05 mm pressure. The crude product weighs 186–187 g (95%) and melts at 95–103°C,,.
A solution of 50 g. (0.13 mole) of dihydrocholesterol in 500 cc. of benzene is added slowly with cooling to a solution of 68 g. (0.23 mole) of crystalline sodium dichromate, 50 cc. of glacial acetic acid, and 90 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 cc. of water in a 3-l. flask. The mixture is agitated thoroughly in a shaking device or by efficient stirring for six hours at 25–30°.
The ether is distilled on a steam bath and the residue fractionated under reduced pressure by means of a 20-cm. column (p. 130). After three fractionations, there is obtained 32–44 g. of a product boiling up to 100° /25 mm., which is mainly unchanged dibromopropene (b.p. 42–43° /18 mm.), and 123–130 g. (60.5–64 per cent of the theoretical amount, not taking into account recovered dibromopropene) of cyclohexylbromopropene boiling at 100–105° /25 mm. This material is satisfactory for most purposes. On redistillation it boils at 88–89° /14 mm.
This concentrate is added to a previously prepared and filtered solution of sodium bisulfite in 40% ethanol contained in a 4-l. beaker provided with a mechanical stirrer. The mixture is stirred for 3 hours, and the addition product then is filtered with suction on an 18-cm. Büchner funnel and washed, first with two 150-ml. portions of ethanol and then with 150 ml. of ether. The yield of air-dried product is 350–360 g. (72–74%, based on the selenious acid used).
After the mixture has been cooled (preferably in an ice bath), the mother liquor is removed from the solid by decantation through a Büchner funnel; if necessary, a wire gauze is used to retain the solid in the flask. To the solid is then added a solution of 150 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 1.5 l. of water. When the excess sodium nitrite has been decomposed, the solid is transferred to a Büchner funnel and washed first with water and then with a small amount of alcohol. The yield of crude, dry tribromobenzene is 250–260 g. (74–77 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product is reddish brown and melts at 112–116°.
The clear, light yellow benzene solution is subjected to rapid steam distillation in the same 5-l. flask, and when no more benzene passes over the flask is cooled under the tap with shaking. The residual oil solidifies to light brown pellets. These are collected, separated from water as much as possible, and dissolved in 2250 cc. of boiling alcohol. Five grams of decolorizing carbon is added; the hot solution is filtered with suction and allowed to cool. The best results are obtained if the alcoholic solution is stirred slowly with a mechanical stirrer while cooling to room temperature. Stirring is stopped when the mixture becomes semi-solid, and the mass is then allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. The fine, colorless needles are filtered on a 15-cm. Büchner funnel and pressed as dry as possible. The yield of thoroughly air-dried, colorless material melting at 91–92° amounts to 125–140 g. (76–85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
C. Hydroxylation of camphor: 1,7,7-trimethyl-3-hydroxybicyclo[2.2.1]-heptan-2-one. A solution of lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) is prepared as follows: A 250-mL, three-necked flask and magnetic stirrer are flame-dried under a slow stream of nitrogen. After cooling, the flask is charged with 40 mL of approximately 1.5 M butyllithium in hexane under nitrogen flow using a syringe. The flask is cooled in a dry ice–acetone bath and 9.2 mL (66 mmol) of diisopropylamine is added by syringe, followed by 40 mL of dry THF. The resulting LDA solution is allowed to reach room temperature under a slow flow of nitrogen. For titration, 0.312 g (2 mmol) of menthol is dissolved in 5 mL of dry THF with a few crystals of phenanthroline under nitrogen flow at −70°C. The LDA solution is added dropwise (using a nitrogen-purged syringe) to the stirred menthol solution until the yellow color of menthoxide–phenanthroline turns to the rust color of LDA–phenanthroline (2.67 mL of LDA solution is needed, 0.75 M).
D. (1R,2S,5R)-5-Methyl-2-(1-methyl-1-phenylethyl)cyclohexanol (3). In a 500-mL round-bottomed reaction flask, fitted with a reflux condenser and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, 12.8 g (41 mmol) of 5 (48%) is dissolved in a solution of 300 mL of ethanol, 40 mL of water, and 46 g (82 mmol) of potassium hydroxide. This solution is refluxed for 2 hr. The solution is concentrated at reduced pressure to a volume of ca. 50 mL and 200 mL of water and 100 mL of ether are added. After the ether layer is separated, the aqueous phase is saturated with sodium chloride and extracted with three 50-mL portions of ether. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent is evaporated. Kugelrohr distillation of the cloudy residual oil yields 8.9–9.2 g (92–97%) of 3, bp 105–115°C at 0.01 mm; [α]D20 −26.4° ± 0.1° (ethanol, c 1.97).
To the isopropyl alcohol filtrate is added another 150-g. portion of benzophenone, and the solution is exposed to sunlight as in the first reduction. The benzopinacol which separates is filtered and dried. The yield in the second and subsequent runs is 142–143 g. (94–95 per cent of the calculated amount). This procedure can be repeated with the same filtrate until six or seven portions (900–1050 g.) of benzophenone have been reduced.
At the end of the heating period the reaction mixture is cooled to about 100–110° (at lower temperatures a gelatinous precipitate separates) and is then poured into 150 ml. of water contained in a 1-l. Erlenmeyer flask. An additional 100 ml. of water is used to rinse the reaction flask. The diluted mixture is acidified to Congo red by slow addition of 6N hydrochloric acid as the mixture is stirred vigorously to ensure conversion of any precipitated potassium salt to the free acid. The mixture is then cooled by tap water for at least 30 minutes. The white precipitate is collected by suction filtration, transferred to a beaker, and is heated with about 250 ml. of water until the solid has melted. As the mixture is cooled, it is stirred vigorously by hand until the oil has resolidified. After the mixture has been cooled again, the precipitated acid is collected by suction filtration, washed with water, and dried. The yield of hendecanedioic acid, m.p. 110.5–112°, is 28.5–30.6 g. (87–93%).
The 2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine may be recovered from the aqueous distillate in two ways: (a) the distillate can be extracted continuously with ether;2 or (b) the distillate can be acidified with hydrochloric acid and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure to give crude 2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine hydrochloride. The base is then liberated by adding an excess of saturated aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The oily layer is separated. The aqueous layer and salt are extracted several times with ether, which is combined with the amine. In either case the ether solution is dried thoroughly over anhydrous potassium carbonate.
B. Benzyl carbamate. A measured aliquot (suitably 10 ml.) of the solution of benzyl chloroformate, prepared as described above, is added slowly and with vigorous stirring to 5 volumes of cold concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90), and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. The precipitate is filtered with suction, washed with cold water, and dried in a vacuum desiccator. The yield of practically pure benzyl carbamate, melting at 85–86°, is 7.0–7.2 g. (91–94% based on the benzyl alcohol used in A). Pure benzyl carbamate melting at 87° is obtained by recrystallizing the slightly impure material from 2 volumes of toluene.
A. N-(2,2,2-Trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)-acetamide (1). A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stir bar and fitted with a glass stopper and a condenser, is charged with 2,2,2-trifluoro-1-methoxyethanol (14.75 g, 102 mmol), acetamide (6.0 g, 102 mmol) and 1,4-dioxane (100 mL). The resulting solution is heated to reflux and stirred in an oil bath under argon for 2 h. The reaction mixture is then cooled to ambient temperature and transferred to a single-necked flask. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue dried under vacuum (25 °C, 1 mmHg) for 1 h to give 16.8 g of a colorless solid residue. This product is dissolved in tert-butyl methyl ether (20 mL) in a one-necked, round-bottomed flask. Silica gel (10 g) is added to the solution and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting adsorbate is added on top of a silica gel column (approximately 180 g), which is eluted with hexanes/ethyl acetate (3:2). The fractions containing the product are combined and evaporated to give N-(2,2,2-trifluoro-1-hydroxyethyl)acetamide (1) as a colorless solid (8.98 g, 56%).
The flask is heated in a Wood's metal bath at 160–170° until the mixture is completely homogeneous. The temperature of the bath is then lowered to 120–130°, and 60 cc. (1 mole) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol is added to the solution through the condenser. The mixture is allowed to reflux for two hours. At the end of this period an additional 20-cc. portion of ethyl alcohol is poured into the solution and refluxing is continued for two hours longer.
B. N-Benzyl-N-methoxymethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine. A 25-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar is charged with 6.0 g (74 mmol) of a 37% aqueous formaldehyde solution. The solution is cooled to 0°C and 10.0 g (51.7 mmol) of N-benzyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine is added dropwise with stirring. After the solution is stirred for 10 min at 0°C, 6 mL (0.15 mol) of methanol is added in one portion. Potassium carbonate (4.0 g) is added to the mixture to absorb the aqueous phase. The mixture is stirred for 1 hr, the nonaqueous phase is decanted, an additional 2.0 g of potassium carbonate is added, and the mixture is stirred at 25°C for 12 hr. Ether is added to the mixture and the solution is dried over potassium carbonate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to give 6.8–8.6 g (54–69%) of N-benzyl-N-methoxymethyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)methylamine as a colorless liquid, bp 77–80°C (0.5 mm).
C. Bicyclopropylidene . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser is charged under nitrogen with 109 g (0.971 mol) of potassium tert-butoxide, and 1 L of dimethyl sulfoxide. The solution is vigorously stirred as 105 g (0.65 mol) of neat 1-bromo-1-cyclopropylcyclopropane is added over a period of 2 hr under nitrogen. The temperature is maintained between 20°C and 25°C with a water bath. The mixture is stirred under a blanket of nitrogen at 20°C for an additional 24 hr. The reflux condenser and the dropping funnelare removed. The flask is immersed in a water bath and connected via a 90° angle glass tube to a 200-mL trap cooled with acetone-dry ice. All the volatile material is bulb-to-bulb distilled into the cold trap under reduced pressure (0.1 mm) at a maximurn temperature of 35°C to 40°C inside the flask. The contents of the cold trap are allowed to warm to 20°C, transferred into a 150-mL separatory funnel, washed with four 50-mL portions of ice-cold water, and then transferred into a preweighed bottle containing 2-3 g of 4 Å molecular sieves. The yield is: 44 g (84%) of bicyclopropylidene.
Finely ground barium hydroxide is added gradually to the well-stirred water solution until the material is slightly alkaline to litmus, in order to remove the excess of arsenic acid; when this point is reached, the solution becomes pink. If the procedure is carried out properly, 700–800 g. of Ba(OH)2·8H2O should suffice. The time required by this method is greater than when a hot solution of barium hydroxide is used, but the method is more convenient and does not cause such a great increase in volume. After removal of the barium arsenate by filtration, the mother liquor and washings are treated with sulfuric acid until the solution contains neither barium nor sulfate ions. When the barium sulfate has been separated and thoroughly washed, the filtrate is concentrated on a steam bath to about 3 l., neutralized to litmus with sodium hydroxide, filtered, evaporated until the solution becomes well coated with crystals, and then treated with 2.5 volumes of alcohol. After the mixture has cooled in an ice box, the sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is separated, washed with alcohol, and dried in an oven at 80°. A second crop may be secured from the filtrate by concentrating it further and precipitating with alcohol. The total yield of anhydrous sodium p-hydroxyphenylarsonate is 252 g. (33 per cent of the theoretical amount). By proper manipulation, it is possible to obtain as much as 240 g. in the first crop and to have it free from sulfate, arsenate, and sodium o-hydroxyphenylarsonate which is one of the by-products formed in this reaction.
C. (2Z,6E,10E)-Ethyl 7,11,15-Trimethyl-3-diethylphosphoryloxy-6,10,14-trienoate. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, two rubber septa, and a nitrogen inlet connected to a mineral oil bubbler, is charged with a 60% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil (1.62 g, 40.6 mmol). The mineral oil is removed by washing with hexanes (3 × 10 mL) allowing the sodium hydride to settle and withdrawing the supernatant solvent with a syringe. Diethyl ether (150 mL) is added, and the mixture is stirred and cooled at 0 °C with an ice-bath. β-Keto ester 3 (11.7 g, 35.3 mmol) in 50 mL of diethyl ether is added slowly via cannula over 20 min, and the reaction mixture is stirred at rt for 20 min or until gas evolution ceases. The clear orange solution is then cooled to 0 °C, and neat diethyl chlorophosphate (9.13 g, 7.67 mL, 52.9 mmol) is added by syringe over 5 min. The mixture is stirred at 0 °C for 15 min, after which time the reaction is quenched by adding saturated aqueous NH4Cl (300 mL). The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 150 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed sequentially with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 (2 × 200 mL) and brine (2 × 200 mL), dried over anhydrous MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporator and vacuum drying to give the crude enol phosphate 4 (16.9 g) as a yellow oil.
B. N-tert-Butoxycarbonyl-2-trimethylsilylpyrrole. A solution of N-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2-bromopyrrole (13.5 g, 54.9 mmol) in 40 mL of hexane is added to 200 mL of tetrahydrofuran in a dry, 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and a three-way stopcock attached to a balloon of nitrogen. The flask is evacuated and purged with nitrogen. The stirred mixture is cooled to −78°C and 34.3 mL of 1.6 M butyllithium in hexane is added slowly via syringe over a 10-min period, during which time the colorless solution becomes brown. After an additional 10 min, 13.4 g (124 mmol) of chlorotrimethylsilane in 10 mL of tetrahydrofuran is added via syringe over a 10-min period. Stirring is continued and the mixture is allowed to warm to −30°C over a 1-hr period. The reaction mixture is quenched with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (10 mL) at which point a dark red-purple color develops. After warming to 0°C, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the product is extracted into 300 mL of hexane. The organic layer is washed twice with 150 mL of water and then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled twice using a Kugelrohr oven at 85°C and 0.15 mm to give the pure product 2 (10.5–11.1 g, 80–85%).
The mixture is then chilled in an ice bath for at least 3 hours, and the olive-brown precipitate of the sparingly soluble copper complex of imidazole derivatives is filtered. The product is washed with about 500 ml. of cold water, suspended while moist in 1 l. of water, and rendered just acid to litmus by the addition of concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 40 ml.). Hydrogen sulfide is then passed into the suspension, with frequent shaking, until precipitation of the copper is complete (2–3 hours). The precipitate is filtered and extracted with 500 ml. of hot water in two or three portions. The clear, light-brown to reddish brown filtrate and washings are boiled for 15 minutes, and then 60 g. (0.26 mole) of picric acid is added with stirring; heating is continued until solution is complete.
B. Ethyl α-chlorophenylacetate. Ethyl mandelate (135 g., 0.75 mole) is dissolved in 98 g. (59 ml., 0.82 mole) of thionyl chloride contained in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser capped with a drying tube. The apparatus is allowed to stand in a hood overnight (about 16 hours), at the end of which time the solution is heated under reflux for 30 minutes on a steam bath. The solution is then poured into 750 ml. of ice water contained in a 2-l. separatory funnel, and the mixture is extracted with two 300-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with two 250-ml. portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution and one 250-ml. portion of water. The washed extracts are dried over 45 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated by distillation. The residue is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask at reduced pressure. The yield of ethyl α-chlorophenylacetate is 121–127 g. (81–85%), b.p. 134–136°/15 mm., n20D 1.5149.
The precipitated potassium sulfate is filtered by passing the solution through a 12-cm. Büchner funnel. The light-yellow or yellowish green filtrate is transferred to a 5-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a Claisen head containing a capillary ebulliator tube and a thermometer, and connected to a water-cooled condenser. The condenser is connected through a vacuum adapter to a 3-l., one-necked, round-bottomed flask, cooled in ice, to act as a receiver. About 2.3 l. of pure, unchanged nitromethane is removed by distillation at aspirator pressure and a water-bath temperature of 40–50°. The distillation takes about 6–7 hours.
As soon as the sodium has dissolved, the contents of the flask are cooled and diluted with 5 l. of water. The flask is equipped at once with a condenser set for distillation, and the distillate is carried below the surface of a solution of 300 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 300 cc. of water in a 12-l. flask. The distillation is continued as long as any basic material passes over. When frothing interferes toward the end of the distillation an additional 3 l. of water is added to the distillation flask. The total distillate is 8–9 l.
C. 1-Hexanol. To a solution of trihexylborane in a 500-ml. three-necked flask [prepared from 25.3 g. (0.301 mole) of 1-hexane in 150 ml. of tetrahydrofuran and 84 ml. of a 1.20 M solution of borane in tetrahydrofuran, as described in Section A] is added 34 ml. (0.1 mole) of a 3 N solution of sodium hydroxide. This is followed by the dropwise addition of 36 ml. (0.35 mole) of 30% hydrogen peroxide at a rate such that the reaction temperature is maintained at approximately 35° (water bath). After being stirred at room temperature for one hour, the mixture is poured into 100 ml. of water. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with 50 ml. of diethyl ether. The combined organic extracts are washed with three 50-ml. portions of saturated brine solution and dried over Drierite. After the bulk of the solvent is removed by distillation, the residue is fractionated with a 24-in., Teflon spinning band column, yielding 7.7–8.2 g. (25.1–26.7%) of 1-hexanol of 95% purity, b.p. 145–153° and 10.1–15.4 g. (33.3–50.3%) of pure 1-hexanol, b.p. 153–155°. The total yield of material with >95% purity is 58.4–77%.
The ether layer is separated, and the solvent is removed by distillation under atmospheric pressure, and the dark-colored residue is fractionated under reduced pressure through a 25-cm. column packed with glass helices. The fraction boiling at 37–38.5°/6 mm. is collected; it weighs 44–45 g. (64–65%); nD25 1.4626; d425 1.404.
A. Dimethylsulfoxonium (S)-2-oxo-3-(Boc-amino)-4-phenylbutylide (2). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a large stir bar, a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen outlet, and a rubber septum through which is inserted a temperature probe. The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min and is then charged with trimethylsulfoxonium iodide (33.0 g, 150 mmol), which is added through a neck that is temporarily opened, and 150 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran, which is added by syringe through a septum. A 1.0 M solution of potassium tert-butoxide in tetrahydrofuran (150 mL, 150 mmol) is added via syringe through a septum, after which the mixture is heated at reflux for 2 h. The resulting solution of dimethylsulfoxonium methylide (containing precipitated potassium iodide) is cooled to 0 °C. The reflux condenser is replaced with a 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel containing a solution of Boc-L-phenylalanine 4-nitrophenyl ester (1) (19.3 g, 50.0 mmol) in 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran and capped with a nitrogen outlet. The solution is added dropwise over 20 min so that the internal temperature does not exceed 5 °C. The mixture is stirred for 1 h at 0 °C. The flask is briefly opened by temporary removal of the addition funnel to allow addition of 50 mL of water and stirring is continued for 15 min at 0 °C. After warming to room temperature, the mixture is filtered through a short pad (3 mm) of Celite on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg). The concentrated mixture is rinsed into a 1-L separatory funnel with 200 mL of water and extracted with one 200-mL portion and two 100-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined extracts are washed with one 50-mL portion of water and two 50-mL portions of brine. (In some cases solid product separates during the first extraction, but it redissolves when the organic phases are combined.) The solution is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg) to afford 2 as a light yellow solid (15.3–15.4 g, 90–91%), which is carried on to the next step without further purification.
To the stirred benzylmagnesium chloride is then added 616 g. (522 cc., 4 moles) of freshly distilled diethyl sulfate. The addition of diethyl sulfate is so regulated that gentle refluxing takes place throughout the reaction. Once reaction is started with a few cubic centimeters of diethyl sulfate, it is necessary to cool the reaction flask by ice water in order to complete addition within about one hour. When all the ester has been added, stirring is continued with gentle boiling for fifteen minutes.
To the hot solutions is now added about one-third of their volume of concentrated hydrochloric acid (2 l. to each portion), and the mixtures are cooled, first in running water, then in a freezing mixture, to 0°. The phenylhydrazine hydrochloride precipitates in the form of slightly yellowish or pinkish crystals which may be filtered off and dried.
C. Cyclohexanecarbonitrile (3). A 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a thermometer, a magnetic stirring bar, and an addition funnel is charged with 2.7 g. (0.050 mole) of sodium methoxide and 25 ml. of methanol. The solution is cooled in ice and stirred while a solution of 17.3 g. (0.0887 mole) of diazene 2 in 10 ml. of methanol is added dropwise at a rate that maintains the solution temperature at 0–10°. Stirring is continued for an additional 30 minutes at ambient temperature, and the mixture is poured into 70 ml. of water. The resulting solution is extracted with five 20-ml. portions of pentane, and the combined organic extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, concentrated, and distilled to provide 8.6–9.4 g. (78–86%) of carbonitrile 3, b.p. 117–119° (90 mm.).
C. Methyl 1-(1-(benzyloxycarbonyl)piperidin-4-yl)-2-oxoindoline-5-carboxylate (6). A 500-mL 3-necked round-bottomed flask equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) is fitted with a reflux condenser with a gas inlet adapter connected to a nitrogen line and a gas bubbler. The other two necks are capped with rubber septa; a thermocouple probe is inserted through one of the septa. The flask is charged with benzyl 4-(2-chloro-N-(4-(methoxycarbonyl)phenyl)acetamido)-piperidine-1-carboxylate (5, 20.0 g, 44.6 mmol, 1 equiv), palladium acetate (1.01 g, 4.5 mmol, 0.1 equiv), 2-(di-t-butylphosphino)biphenyl (2.74 g, 9.2 mmol, 0.2 equiv), 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (130 mL), and 2-propanol (32 mL). The light brown suspension is sparged subsurface with nitrogen gas for 15 min. Triethylamine (6.93 g, 68 mmol, 1.5 equiv) is added via a 12-mL syringe and the mixture is sparged for an additional 5 min. The flask is placed in an oil bath at 80 °C and heated to an internal temperature of 74-76 °C for 2 h. The hot mixture is vacuum-filtered through a pad of Celite (25 g, pre-wetted with 2-MeTHF) in a 150-mL medium-porosity sintered glass funnel into a 1-L round-bottomed flask. The flask employed to carry out the reaction is rinsed with hot (75 °C) 2-MeTHF (100 mL) and used to wash the Celite pad. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (bath temperature: 40 °C; 40 mmHg) to give an orange-brown solid (34 g). The flask is equipped with a PTFE-coated magnetic stirring bar (3 x 1 cm) and 2-propanol (270 mL) is added. The stirred suspension is heated to a gentle reflux with a heating mantle to dissolve all solids, generating a nearly black solution. The heating mantle is turned off and the contents are allowed to cool to ambient temperature over 2 h with stirring to give thick crystallization. The suspension is stirred for 4 h, then vacuum-filtered using a 150-mL medium-porosity sintered-glass funnel, washed with 2-propanol (2 x 30 mL, Note 22), then dried in a vacuum oven (70 mmHg) at 40 °C for 2 days to afford oxindole 6 as a gray solid (15.9 g, 87% yield).
D. 2-Methyl-3-[(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]-2-cyclopenten-1-one. In a flame-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with an addition funnel under a nitrogen atmosphere are placed 20.0 g (58.8 mmol) of 2,3-dibromo-1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-propene and 7.0 mL (60.0 mmol) of 3-methyl-2,4-pentanedione in 300 mL of methanol. The flask is cooled using an ice-water bath. To this mixture is added 140 mL (70.0 mmol) of a 0.5 N methanolic solution of sodium methoxide dropwise over 30 min. The solution is stirred at 25°C for 5 hr and cooled to 0°C. Another 140-mL (70.0 mmol) portion of the 0.5 N methanolic solution of sodium methoxide is added over 20 min. After being stirred at 25°C for 10 hr, the reaction is quenched by the addition of 50 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator at aspirator vacuum and the resulting residue is taken up in 100 mL of water and 200 mL of dichloromethane. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 200 mL). The organic layer is washed with water (100 mL) and brine (100 mL) and then dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and concentration, the residue is recrystallized from ethyl acetate to give 6.5 g (44%) of 2-methyl-3-[(phenylsulfonyl)methyl]-2-cyclopenten-1-one,.
B. o-Eugenol. The allyl ether (70 g.) is cautiously brought to boiling in a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, refluxed for 1 hour, and cooled. The oil is dissolved in 100 ml. of ether, and the solution is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of 10% sodium hydroxide. The combined alkaline extracts are then acidified with 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid diluted with 100 ml. of water, and the mixture is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are dried with 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate and evaporated, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of o-eugenol boiling at 120–122°/12 mm. is 56–63 g. (80–90%).
A. 4-Methyl-4-nitrovaleric acid. In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer and reflux condenser is placed a solution prepared from 118 g. (1.78 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide pellets and 500 ml. of water. A thermometer may be so placed in the third neck that the bulb extends below the surface of the solution. To this solution is added 300 g. (1.71 moles) of methyl 4-methyl-4-nitrovalerate.2 The mixture is stirred and gently heated and. After hydrolysis has started, as indicated by changes in appearance of the hazy reaction mixture, the external source of heat is removed. The reaction is complete when the cloudy mixture has changed to a clear solution. This requires about 20–25 minutes.
After filtration of the ether solution from the mixture of solid potassium carbonate and dark solids which have settled out, the ether is removed by distillation on a steam cone from a 50-ml. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. column. Usually suction must be applied to remove the last traces of ether. The residue is distilled at 4 mm. and a bath temperature of 200°. There is a small fore-run of 1–1.5 g. of a very pale yellow liquid which distils at 155–157°. The main fraction, boiling at 157–159°, is practically colorless and weighs 19–22 g. When the temperature of the thermometer in the flask starts to drop, the bath temperature is gradually raised to 240°. In this way, 3–4 g. more of light orange-yellow dianisyl is obtained. The yield based on the three fractions is 23–27.5 g. (66–78%). The fractions usually crystallize spontaneously; if they do not crystallize, they are cooled and scratched.
When the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred overnight at room temperature, maintaining a nitrogen atmosphere. Excess sodium hydride is destroyed by slow addition of 10 ml. of water. The N,N-dimethylformamide is evaporated at 40° (0.01 mm.), and the residue is diluted with 800 ml. of toluene and 800 ml. of water. After thorough shaking, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is discarded, and the toluene layer is washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, and filtered. Removal of toluene under reduced pressure leaves a yellow oil, which crystallizes on standing.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with reflux condenser, mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and nitrogen gas inlet is placed a solution of 80.0 g. (43.5 ml., 0.82 mole) of concentrated sulfuric acid in 3 l. of water. The solution is stirred under nitrogen, and 740.0 g. (2.49 moles) of reagent mercuric sulfate is added to form a suspension of deep-yellow, basic mercuric sulfate. The mixture is stirred and heated to 55° under nitrogen, and 82.0 g. (101 ml., 1.0 mole) of cyclohexene is added at once. A temperature of 55–65° is maintained for 1 hour. During this time the color of the reaction mixture changes from a deep yellow to the cream color of the cyclohexene-mercuric sulfate complex.
B. Preparation of (η5-(S)-2-(4-methylethyl)oxazolinylcyclo-pentadienyl)-(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt. A flame-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an air condenser, stirring bar and an argon inlet. The flask is flushed with dry argon and then charged with (η5-carbomethoxycyclopentadienyl)-(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt (10 g, 18.6 mmol), lithium iodide (4.95 g, 37.2 mmol), and 100 mL of 2,4,6-collidine by temporarily removing the condenser. The resulting solution is warmed to reflux. After 16 h, the solution is cooled to room temperature and diluted with 50 mL of methylene chloride. This solution is washed with 150 mL of 2 N aqueous hydrochloric acid, and the aqueous layer is extracted with 150 mL of methylene chloride. The combined organic phases are then washed with 2 N aqueous hydrochloric acid (4 × 150 mL), dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to provide (η5-carboxycyclo-pentadienyl)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt as an orange solid, which is used directly in the next transformation.
B. Diethyl [(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)methyl]phosphonate. A mixture of 33.63 g (0.2 mol) of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate, 21 g (0.25 mol) of dihydropyran, and 150 mL of diethyl ether is placed in a stoppered flask, and 20 drops of phosphorus oxychloride is added while the contents are swirled manually. After 3 hr at room temperature the reaction is monitored by TLC. The mixture is diluted with diethyl ether, transferred into a separatory funnel, and shaken successively with 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, 100 mL of water, and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution. The ether solution is dried over MgSO4, filtered, and the ether is removed with a rotary evaporator. Kugelrohr distillation of the residue (110°C, 0.05 mm) gives 42.4–46.9 g (84–93%) of material of sufficient purity for use in homologation reactions and.
In a 125-cc. distilling flask, provided with a water-cooled side arm to act as reflux condenser, is placed 56 g. (33.4 cc., 0.47 mole) of thionyl chloride. This is heated on a water bath, and to it is added during the course of one hour 35.2 g. (0.4 mole) of n-butyric acid by means of a separatory funnel attached to the neck of the flask. The evolved gases are absorbed in water.
C. 4-Methoxy-4'-nitrobiphenyl (3). A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, magnetic stirring bar, nitrogen gas inlet, and rubber septum is charged sequentially with 300 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide, 15.0 g (55.4 mmol) of 4-nitrophenyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (1), 27.8 g (70.0 mmol) of tributyl(4-methoxyphenyl)stannane (2), 7.5 g of dry lithium chloride, and 1.6 g (4 mol percent) of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride. The rubber septum is replaced with a Teflon stopper and the yellow mixture is heated at 100–105°C for 2.5 hr. After approximately 20 min, the reaction turns dark brown.
A solution of 72 g. (0.60 mole) of mesitylene in 375 ml. of dry methylene chloride is placed in a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a stirrer, and a dropping funnel. The solution is cooled in an ice bath, and 190 g. (110 ml., 1.0 mole) of titanium tetrachloride is added over a period of 3 minutes. While the solution is stirred and cooled, 57.5 g. (0.5 mole) of dichloromethyl methyl ether2 is added dropwise over a 25-minute period. The reaction begins (as indicated by evolution of hydrogen chloride) when the first drop of chloro ether is added. After the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for 5 minutes in the ice bath, for 30 minutes without cooling, and for 15 minutes at 35°.
The amine hydrochloride solution is evaporated nearly to dryness on a steam bath and transferred with about 300 ml. of water to a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer,2 separatory funnel, and condenser. The stirrer is started, and the acid solution is cooled to 0° by immersing the flask in an ice bath. The amines are liberated by adding slowly 100 g. of sodium hydroxide dissolved in 250 ml. of water.
N-[1-phenyl-3-(trimethylsilyl)-prop-2-ynylidene]-benzenamine. A flame-dried, 200-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2.5-cm football-shaped stir bar, sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. The flask is charged with anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (80 mL, Note 1) and cooled to 0 °C (external temperature) in an ice-bath. Vigorous stirring is commenced and (trimethylsilyl)acetylene (13.3 mL, 9.41 g, 95.8 mmol, 2.70 equiv, Note 2) is added to the flask via syringe. Butyllithium (40.6 mL, 95.8 mmol, 2.36 M, 2.70 equiv, Note 3) is added to the THF solution of (trimethylsilyl)acetylene over 10 min via syringe as the mixture was kept at 0 °C. After 5 min, the colorless solution of the lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide is removed from the ice-bath and allowed to warm to ambient temperature and kept at this temperature for an additional 40 min. During this time, another flame-dried, 300-mL, single-neck round-bottomed flask is equipped with a 2.5-cm football-shaped stir bar, charged with solid copper(I) bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (19.71 g, 95.84 mmol, 2.700 equiv, Note 2), sealed with a rubber septum under an argon atmosphere, and fitted with an argon-filled balloon through a syringe needle. The flask containing copper bromide is charged with tetrahydrofuran (80 mL, Note 1) and the mixture is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath (−78 °C, external temperature). The lithium (trimethylsilyl)acetylide solution at ambient temperature is slowly transferred via cannula over 5 min to the cold (−78 °C, external temperature) flask containing copper bromide. The bright-yellow solution is maintained at −78 °C for an additional 5 min. The flask containing the yellow copper acetylide solution is moved from the dry ice-acetone bath to an ice-water bath and maintained for 20 min prior to use.
The reaction mixture is poured into a 4-l. separatory funnel and washed with 1 l. of cold water. The chloroform layer is washed with 6 N hydrochloric acid until the amine bases are removed and the wash remains acidic The chloroform extracts are washed successively with 5% aqueous sodium hydroxide and saturated brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, and the product is distilled under vacuum, yielding 122–130 g. (68–71%) of ethyl 3-ethyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolecarboxylate, b.p. 72° (0.5 mm.), nD23 1.4615.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer are placed 170 g. (1.2 moles) of phosphorus pentoxide, 187 g. (2 moles) of chloroacetamide2, and 800 ml. of dry technical trimethylbenzene. The mixture is refluxed gently with vigorous stirring for 1 hour. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to about 100° with continuous stirring, and the reflux condenser is replaced with a distilling adapter fitted with a thermometer and a water-cooled condenser.
A. 2-Bromo-2-cyclopentenone. In a well-ventilated hood, a solution of 18.98 g (231.2 mmol) of 2-cyclopentenone in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added to a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and an addition funnel. The solution is chilled to 0°C with an ice bath and a solution of 40.5 g (253.4 mmol, 13.0 mL) of bromine in 150 mL of carbon tetrachlorideis added dropwise during 1 hr. Then a solution of 35.1 g (346.8 mmol, 48.3 mL) of triethylamine in 150 mL of carbon tetrachloride is added dropwise over 1 hr with vigorous stirring while the reaction is held at 0°C. Stirring is continued for an additional 2 hr at room temperature; the resulting dark suspension is filtered with suction and the filtercake washed with carbon tetrachloride. The filtrate and washings are combined and washed with two 100-mL portions of 2 N hydrochloric acid, one 100-mL portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, one 100-mL portion of water, and one 100-mL portion of saturated sodium chloride solution. The resultant solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent removed under reduced pressure. Distillation of the resultant oil (69–78°C, 1.0 mm) afforded 23.7 g (147.2 mmol, 64%) of a white crystalline solid, mp 36–37°C, (lit.2 mp 39–39.5°C).
C. Saponification. The ester is saponified by refluxing for 5 hours with 75 ml. of a 10% sodium hydroxide solution containing 3 ml. of ethanol; it is then poured into 150 ml. of water and decolorized with Norit. Upon acidification of the alkaline solution with dilute hydrochloric acid, 18–19 g. (40–43%) and of acid is obtained, melting at 191–193° (cor.).
A 3-l. three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser protected from the air by a calcium chloride tube, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer is mounted on a steam bath. In the flask are placed 48 g. (2 moles) of magnesium turnings, 150 cc. of anhydrous ether and 100 g. of bromomesitylene (p. 95). The reaction starts slowly, and sometimes it is necessary to add some iodine or use Gilman's catalyst. After the reaction starts, it proceeds smoothly and the remaining 298 g. of bromomesitylene (a total of 2 moles) in about 700 cc. of dry ether is added at such a rate that the ether boils briskly. After the last of this ether solution has been added, the mixture is heated on the steam cone until practically all the magnesium has dissolved.
The resulting green sirupy emulsion is diluted with an equal volume of water, whereupon 220–225 cc. of an oil containing the desired ester, slowly separates. This oil is washed three times with water, separated, and treated with a few grams of anhydrous sodium sulfate in order to remove most of the water. It is now distilled slowly through a large, efficient fractionating column. The fraction boiling at 150–170° is collected, and should amount to 170–175 cc. It is washed with five 15-cc. portions of 60 per cent sulfuric acid (sp. gr. about 1.5), is then washed free of acids with dilute sodium hydroxide, and finally washed free of alkali with cold water. It is rapidly dried, as before, with sodium sulfate, and fractionated through the same distilling column. The fraction boiling at 162–166° (uncorr.) consists of n-butyl n-butyrate, containing a small percentage of residual butyl alcohol. The yield is 96–110 g. (41–47 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. (4R,5S)-3-(1-Methoxyethyl)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolidinone . A 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, thermometer, and a reflux condenser is charged with (4R,5S)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolidinone (20.0 g, 84 mmol), (±)-10-camphorsulfonic acid (9.7 g, 42 mmol), and acetaldehyde dimethyl acetal (700 mL). The mixture is heated at gentle reflux in an oil bath (bath temperature 80°C) for 5 hr. The mixture is allowed to cool to ambient temperature, then concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. Ethyl acetate (100 mL) is added to the residue, and the ethyl acetate solution is transferred to a beaker. The solution is neutralized with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), and transferred into a separatory funnel. The two layers are separated, and the lower aqueous layer is extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The organic layers are combined, washed with brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , filtered, then concentrated under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator. The residue is stirred with 2-propanol-hexane (1 : 1, 60 mL) for several minutes. The solid product is collected by filtration. The filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator, and the residue is again stirred with 2-propanol-hexane (1 : 1, 5 mL). The precipitate is collected by filtration. The two lots of the products are dried in a desiccator over phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5) under reduced pressure for 12 hr. (4R,5S)-3-(Methoxyethyl)-4,5-diphenyl-2-oxazolidinone (22.2 g, 89.3%) is obtained as a diastereomeric mixture. In some runs, small amounts of impurities remained after trituration. These impurities can be carried through the next step without a problem although final yields will be reduced.
A. Bromomethanesulfonyl bromide. A 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalized dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 100 g (0.73 mol) of sym-trithiane suspended in 600 mL of water. Bromine (1136 g, 7.1 mol) is added with stirring while keeping the flask temperature around 40°C. After the addition of half of the bromine, 600 mL of water is added and bromine addition is continued. After all of the bromine has been added, the reaction mixture is stirred for 0.25 hr. The mixture is transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel, the lower organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 200-mL portions of methylene chloride. The organic extracts are combined, washed with one 100-mL portion of cold 5% sodium bisulfite solution and with 100 mL of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated at room temperature with a rotary evaporator to a light-yellow oil. Distillation using a short Vigreux column affords 218–249 g (42–48%) of bromomethanesulfonyl bromide as a light-yellow oil, bp 68–69°C (0.55 mm) and.
A 1-l., three-necked flask is equipped with a nitrogen-inlet tube fitted with a stopcock, a glass joint fitted with a rubber septum, a 125-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a thermometer, and a glass-covered magnetic stirring bar. After the apparatus has been dried in an oven, 20 mg. of 2,2'-bipyridyl is added to the flask and the apparatus is thoroughly flushed with anhydrous, oxygen-free nitrogen. A static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the reaction vessel throughout subsequent operations involving organometallic reagents. An ethereal solution containing 0.40 mole of methyllithium is added to the reaction vessel with a hypodermic syringe. The diethyl ether is removed by evacuating the apparatus while the solution is stirred and the flask is warmed with a water bath (40°). The reaction vessel is refilled with nitrogen and 400 ml. of 1,2-dimethoxyethane (b.p. 83°, freshly distilled from lithium aluminum hydride) is transferred to the reaction vessel with a hypodermic syringe or a stainless steel cannula. The resulting purple solution of methyllithium and the methyllithium bipyridyl charge-transfer complex is cooled to 0–10° before 29.3 g. (0.190 mole) of 2-methyl-1-cyclohexen-1-yl acetate is added, dropwise and with stirring, over a period of 35–45 minutes while the temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 0–10° with an ice bath. After the addition of the enol acetate, the reaction solution must still retain a light red-orange color indicating the presence of a small amount of excess methyllithium. To this cold (10°) solution is added rapidly (10–15 seconds) and with stirring, 68.4 g. (0.400 mole) of freshly distilled benzyl bromide [b.p. 78–79° (12 mm.), nD25 1.5738]. The resulting yellow solution is stirred for 2–2.5 minutes (during which time the temperature of the reaction mixture rises from 10° to about 30°), poured into 500 ml. of cold (0–10°), saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate, and extracted with three 150-ml. portions of pentane. The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and concentrated with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure, separating 31–41 g. of forerun fractions, b.p. 71–89° (20 mm.) and 41–87° (0.3 mm.), and 20.7–22.2 g. (54–58%) of 2-benzyl-2-methylcyclohexanone as a colorless to pale yellow liquid, b.p. 87–93° (0.3 mm.), nD25 1.5322–1.5344 and.
B. exo-cis-Bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2-carboxylic acid. A mixture of 100 g. (0.440 mole) of 2-(trichloromethyl)bicyclo[3.3.0]octane and 500 ml. of 85% phosphoric acid is put into a 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer. The mixture is stirred and heated at 150° for 16 hours, during which time it evolves hydrogen chloride and darkens. The product is then allowed to cool and is poured into a separatory funnel. One liter of water is added and the resulting mixture is extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is then extracted with four 250-ml. portions of 2% aqueous sodium hydroxide, and the resulting alkaline extract is washed with 100 ml. of ether to remove any neutral material. The alkaline extract is acidified (to pH 2–3) with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and the oil which precipitates is extracted with three 250-ml. portions of ether. The resulting ether extract is dried with 15 g. of magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at 50° (30 mm.). The residue is then distilled at reduced pressure to obtain 29–32 g. (43–47%) of exo-cis-bicyclo[3.3.0]octane-2-carboxylic acid, b.p. 91–96° (0.15 mm.), n25D 1.4839–1.4847.
D. Bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane. Finely powdered 2,3-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene (83 g., crude product from above) is placed in a 500-ml., one-necked, round-bottomed flask. The flask is heated at 130–140° in an oil bath to completely remove any traces of pentane. A 25-cm. unpacked Hempel column is installed and connected directly to a 100-ml. receiver flask having a side arm to which is attached a drying tube packed with silica gel. The receiver is cooled in a dry ice-acetone bath. The azobicyclic is pyrolyzed by heating the oil bath to 180–195°. At the preferred rate of pyrolysis, the starting material condenses about one fourth of the way up the column. Occasional flaming of the column may be necessary to prevent plugging of the column by the solidifying starting material. At the end of the pyrolysis (8 hours) only a small, black, nonvolatile residue remains: The condensed bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane is allowed to warm to room temperature, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the drying agent removed by filtration through glass wool into a 100-ml. distillation flask. (Caution! Bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane is a very volatile hydrocarbon and requires appropriate handling for high yields.) Distillation leaves a residue of about 1 g. of the starting azobicyclic and affords 53.5–55.5 g. (90.0–93.5%) of bicyclo[2.1.0]pentane, b.p. 45.5°, n20D 1.4220.
(A) Preparation of Cuprous Cyanide Solution.—Cuprous chloride prepared from 1250 g. (5 moles) of crystallized copper sulfate, according to the directions given on p. 170, is suspended in 2 l. of cold water in a 15-l. crock fitted with a mechanical stirrer. A solution of 650 g. (12.7–13 moles) of sodium cyanide (96–98 per cent) in 1 l. of water is added and the mixture stirred, whereupon the cuprous chloride enters into solution with considerable evolution of heat. The mixture is then cooled by surrounding the crock with cold water.
The pentane solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and fractionated with an efficient spinning-band column. After foreruns of pentane and glyme containing t-nitrosobutane are removed, 26–27 g. (42–43%) of red di-t-butyl nitroxide, b.p. 59–60° (11 mm.), is obtained.
D. 2-(3-Bromophenyl)-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (4). A 20-mL microwave vial is charged with azirine (3) (2.20 g, 6.45 mmol) dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane (11 mL). A stir bar is added, the vial is sealed, and the resulting orange solution is heated for 1 h in a Biotage Initiator Eight Microwave Reactor held at a constant temperature of 175 °C. Only trace starting material remained as determined by TLC: product (4) Rf = 0.35 (9:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate). A total of 6.60 g (3 × 2.20 g, 19.3 mmol) of (3) is treated in this manner and the resulting solutions are combined and concentrated in vacuo (40 °C, 20 mmHg). Celite (7 g) and methylene chloride (40 mL) are added and concentrated by rotary evaporation (35 °C, 20 mmHg). The adsorbed material is loaded onto a column and purified using silica gel chromatography (120 g silica gel, 25 cm × 3 cm, start 20:1 hexanes:ethyl acetate to 3:1 gradient, 40 mL/min, 30 min, 1.2 L total solvent volume) to give (4) (6.08 g, 92%) as a yellow powder.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 100 g. (0.33 mole) of benzalacetone dibromide (p. 105), 30 g. (0.37 mole) of anhydrous sodium acetate, and 250 ml. of 95% ethanol, and the mixture is refluxed vigorously for 4 hours in the absence of direct sunlight. The precipitate of sodium bromide is removed by filtration, and the alcohol is removed from the filtrate by distillation under reduced pressure. The residual salt-oil mixture is extracted with two 50-ml. portions of ether, and the ether solution is transferred to a 250-ml. separatory funnel(Caution!).
B. [1.1.1]Propellane (2). A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that has been flame dried under reduced pressure and purged with argon, is equipped with a vacuum adapter equipped with an argon balloon, an efficient mechanical stirrer, and a pressure-equalizing, 150-mL addition funnel equipped with a rubber septum. The flask is charged with a 25-g (0.085 mol) portion of material obtained from part A, and 25 mL of pentane. A diethyl ether solution of methyllithium, 132 mL of a 1.4 M (0.185 mol) solution, is transferred to the addition funnel via cannula under a flow of argon. The reaction flask is cooled to −78°C and the methyllithium is added over 15 min with vigorous stirring. The reaction mixture is maintained at −78°C for 10 - 15 min; then the −78°C cooling bath is replaced with an ice-water bath (0°C), and the addition funnel is replaced with a rubber septum equipped with an argon balloon. Stirring is continued for an additional hour; then the volatile materials are transferred under reduced pressure to a flame-dried flask that is cooled to −196°C. Based on the recovery of the thiophenol adduct, the yield of [1.1.1]propellane is between 75 and 88%.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask immersed in an ice bath and provided with a stirrer, thermometer, and dropping funnel are placed 168 ml. (200 g.) of concentrated (37–38%) hydrochloric acid (2 moles) and 240 g. of paraformaldehyde (effectively 8 moles of formaldehyde). While the temperature is maintained below 10°, 452 ml. (6.9 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid is added dropwise at such a rate that gaseous hydrogen chloride is not lost from the mixture. This requires about 5.5 hours. The mixture is stirred for 4 hours in the melting ice bath and comes to room temperature. It may be allowed to stand overnight. The layers are separated, and the product (upper layer) is washed twice with ice water. Ice is added to the product, and 250 ml. of 40% sodium hydroxide is then added to the mixture slowly with vigorous agitation until the aqueous phase is strongly alkaline. The product is separated and dried rapidly over potassium carbonate and then over potassium hydroxide, keeping the product cold during drying. After separation of the drying agent by filtration, 350–370 g. (76–81%) of product sufficiently pure for many purposes is obtained. On distillation there is obtained 330–350 g. (72–76%) of bischloromethyl ether, boiling at 100–104°. Approximately 95% boils at 101–101.5°, n25D 1.4420.
The distillate is cooled to about 0° and washed three times with 50-cc. portions of concentrated sulfuric acid cooled to 0°; it is then shaken with 25 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate until the odor of hydrobromic acid disappears. It is distilled through a 1-m. fractionating column at atmospheric pressure collecting the portion boiling at 91–93° (88.5–90.5°/728 mm.), or under reduced pressure through a 70 by 2-cm. total reflux, adjustable take-off, adiabatic column, b.p. 41–43°/135 mm. The product weighs 525–570 g. (55–60 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(Z)-3,7-Dimethyl-2,6-octadienal. A 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with the following order of the reagents: acetonitrile (28 mL), (Z)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-ol (nerol) (5.70 mL, 32.5 mmol), aqueous pH 7.0 buffer solution (8 mL), 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO) (490 mg, 3.24 mmol), and iodobenzene diacetate (IBD) (11.49 g, 35.71 mmol). The reaction mixture is stirred at 0 °C until nerol is no longer detectable by TLC analysis. The reaction mixture is diluted with diethyl ether (100 mL) and transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The orange mixture is washed with saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate (2 × 50 mL). The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 35 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate (40 mL) and then with saturated aqueous sodium chloride (40 mL). The organic layer is dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated with a rotary evaporator (35 °C, 70 mmHg). The residue is purified by column chromatography on silica gel, using a 1:9 mixture of diethyl ether and hexanes as eluent to afford 4.30–4.39 g (87–89%) of (Z)-3,7-dimethyl-2,6-octadien-1-al (neral) as a colorless oil. The material is homogenous by TLC, IR, 1H and 13C-NMR.
The acetone filtrate is concentrated to 700 ml. and cooled to 0–5°. An additional 4–8 g. (6–11%) of slightly less pure benzil, m.p. 198–201°, crystallizes from solution.
Methyl indole-4-carboxylate. To a threaded glass, 200-mL reaction vessel, equipped with a Teflon stirring bar, is added methyl 2-ethenyl-3-nitrobenzoate (10.35 g, 50.0 mmol), triphenylphosphine (3.23 g, 12.3 mmol) and 100 mL of acetonitrile. The mixture is stirred for 10 min to dissolve the reagents. Palladium acetate (0.673 g, 3.00 mmol) is added; a yellow precipitate is immediately formed. The tube is attached to a pressure head and the solution is saturated with carbon monoxide (four cycles to 59 psi of CO). The reaction mixture is heated to 90°C (oil bath temperature) under CO (59 psi) for 50 hr. A red-brown solution forms after heating for a few minutes. In order to remove carbon dioxide that is formed and to monitor the progress of the reaction, the vessel is removed from the oil bath for 15 min, carefully vented, and repressurized with CO every 10-12 hr. After 50 hr, the reaction mixture is cooled and concentrated using a rotary evaporator at water aspirator pressure, giving a dark brown/black oil. The crude product is purified by chromatography on a pre-packed 40 × 4 cm silica column using 7:3 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (0.80 L), then 1:1 hexanes:CH2Cl2 (2.80 L) as eluents affording methyl indole-4-carboxylate (7.95 g, 44.75 mmol, 91%) as a pale yellow solid.
B. 2-Bromo-3-methylbenzoic acid. Caution! This procedure must be carried out in a hood with a good draft, because poisonous hydrogen cyanide is evolved. In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 90 g. of potassium cyanide, 900 ml. of 2-ethoxyethanol, 850 ml. of water, and the moist 2-bromo-4-nitrotoluene obtained above. A reflux condenser is attached, and the mixture is boiled for 16 hours. To the hot, dark-red solution is then added 1.5 l. of water, and the mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. (Caution! Hydrogen cyanide is evolved.) The acidified mixture is boiled for 15 minutes to expel hydrogen cyanide and then allowed to cool to 35–40°. Five grams of diatomaceous earth is stirred in, and the mixture is filtered through a Büchner funnel precoated with a little diatomaceous earth. The solid is discarded, and the filtrate is extracted three times with 200-ml. portions of chloroform. The chloroform extracts are combined and extracted with three 100-ml. portions of 5% ammonium carbonate solution. The basic extracts are combined, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and cooled in an ice bath. The oil which first forms soon crystallizes.
A. Lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide. A dry, 500-ml., three-necked flask, fitted with a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel in the center neck and a stopcock in each side neck, is equipped for magnetic stirring and maintained under a static nitrogen pressure by attaching a nitrogen source to one stopcock and a mercury bubbler to the other. In the flask is placed 153 ml. of a hexane solution containing 0.250 mole of n-butyllithium, and stirring is started. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath, and 42.2 g. (0.263 mole) of hexamethyldisilazane is added dropwise over a period of 10 minutes. The ice-bath is removed, and the solution is stirred for 15 minutes longer. The hexane is removed under reduced pressure by replacing the mercury bubbler with heavy rubber tubing connected to a dry-ice condenser and an oil pump. During this step, the flask is immersed in a water bath at 40–50°, and stirring is continued as long as possible. After complete evaporation of the hexane, white crystals of lithium bis-(trimethylsilyl)amide appear. The flask is again subjected to a static pressure of nitrogen, and 225 ml. of tetrahydrofuran is added to dissolve the crystals.
B. 1-Bromo-2-fluorobenzene. Caution! This step should be carried out in a hood because the PF5 evolved on thermal decomposition of the diazonium salt is poisonous. The apparatus consists of a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a condenser, a magnetic stirrer (optional), and a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask that is attached by means of a short rubber Gooch connecting tube. The dry powdered hexafluorophosphate salt is placed in the Erlenmeyer flask, and 300 ml. of heavy mineral oil is placed in the round-bottomed flask. The mineral oil is heated to 165–170° by means of an oil bath or electric heating mantle and maintained at this temperature while the salt is added rapidly in portions over a period of 30 minutes. The flask is cooled rapidly to room temperature, the side flask is removed, and 400 ml. of 10% aqueous sodium carbonate is added slowly through the condenser. The mixture is steam-distilled until no more oil is visible in the distillate.
B. Atropaldehyde diethyl acetal. A mixture of 18.7 g (0.100 mol) of 1,1-dichloro-2-phenylcyclopropane, 16 g (0.40 mol) of sodium hydroxide, and 160 mL of ethanol is placed in a 250-mL flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The mixture is heated under reflux for 24 hr. Some bumping may occur. Water (200 mL) is added, and the mixture is extracted with three 30-mL portions of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, dried as above with magnesium sulfate, concentrated in vacuo, and distilled through a 20-cm Vigreux column. The acetal begins to distill at about 70°C (0.5 mm), and the product (14–15 g) is collected until the temperature reaches about 100°C. Gas chromatographic analysis of the product shows it to be about 85% pure (yield 58–62%).
The oil, which is heavier than water, is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 50-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The oil and extracts are combined, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled from a Claisen flask with an indented neck. Colorless 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene is collected at 58–59°/17 mm. or 156–157°/760 mm.; weight 45–47 g. (73–75% based on o-bromoaniline); nD25 1.5320–1.5325.
C. 3',5'-Di-O-benzoyl-2'-O-[(3-trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-5-methyluridine . In an oven-dried, 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum is placed 1,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-2-O-[(3-trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-α-D-ribofuranose (5.6 g, 8.8 mmol) and 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)-5-methylpyrimidine (2.16 g, 7.1 mmol) in 100 mL of acetonitrile. At this stage, the reaction may appear as a white suspension. The stirred reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C and tin(IV) chloride (13.75 g, 52.8 mmol) is added dropwise over 15 min with vigorous stirring. Upon addition of tin(IV) chloride, the reaction becomes homogeneous. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 6 hr. The reaction is then quenched by pouring the mixture into a 1-L separatory funnel containing 250 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate and 200 g of ice. Upon quenching the reaction, voluminous white precipitates appear. Ethyl acetate (200 mL) is added, the separatory funnel is cautiously swirled, and the layers are allowed to separate. The aqueous layer, which now appears milky white, is further extracted with ethyl acetate (2 × 100 mL). The combined extracts are washed with brine (2 × 200 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate . After filtration, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil. Purification by flash column chromatography ( 100 g of silica gel) eluting with 25% ethyl acetate in hexanes gives 3',5'-di-O-benzoyl-2'-O-[(3-trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-5-methyluridine as a white solid (3.52 g, 62% yield), mp 92-95°C,.
The cold cuprous cyanide solution is now chilled to 0–5° by the addition of ice, and 1 l. of benzene is poured on the surface. To this mixture is slowly added the cold neutralized diazonium solution. During the addition, which occupies about thirty minutes, such vigorous stirring is maintained that the benzene on the surface is constantly drawn to the stirrer, and the temperature is maintained at 0–5° by occasionally adding ice. As soon as the diazonium solution comes into contact with the cuprous cyanide, a dark yellow, oily precipitate is formed which at once begins to give off nitrogen; the resulting nitrile is taken up by the benzene as soon as it is formed. When all has been added, the temperature is held at 0–5° for thirty minutes longer, and then is allowed to rise to that of the room (20–25°), which usually requires about three hours.
A 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer and a reflux condenser, is placed on a steam cone. In the flask are placed 250 g. (208 ml., 2 moles) of nitrobenzene, 2.5 l. of methanol, and a solution of 325 g. (8.1 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 750 ml. of distilled water. To the mixture is added 265 g. (4.1 moles) of zinc dust, the stirrer is started, and the mixture is refluxed for 10 hours. The mixture is filtered while hot, and the precipitate of sodium zincate is washed on the filter with a little warm methanol. All the methanol is distilled from the filtrate, the residue is chilled, and the crystalline azobenzene is filtered.
C. Cyclohexylmethyl N-tosyloxycarbamate (5). A 500-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask containing the oily residue obtained from procedure B (15.9 g) is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet. The system is flushed with nitrogen for 30 min and maintained under nitrogen atmosphere. Diethyl ether (200 mL) is added via cannula and the solution is cooled with an ice bath. The system is quickly opened to add p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (20.2 g, 106 mmol). Triethylamine (13.4 mL, 96.4 mmol) is introduced into the addition funnel using a syringe and is added dropwise over a 15-minute time period to the ethereal solution. The addition funnel is rinsed with diethyl ether (10 mL) and the solution is stirred in the ice bath for 1.5 h. Distilled water (75 mL) is added to the white suspension and the resulting clear mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. After vigorous shaking, the organic layer is separated and washed with a saturated sodium chloride solution (75 mL), dried over MgSO4 (15 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg and 20 mmHg) until the residue becomes solid and then at 0.5 mmHg for 12 h to afford a yellowish solid. The solid is dissolved in 50 mL of dichloromethane and is charged on a 6.5 × 11 cm silica gel column (200 g of dry silica). The system is eluted with a mixture of 5% ethyl acetate-dichloromethane. The first 150 mL are discarded and the next 800 mL are collected in a 1-L round-bottomed flask and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg, then 20 mmHg) until the residue becomes a solid which is then dried at 0.5 mmHg. The inner surface of the flask is scratched with a spatula in order to loosen the product from the flask. To the 1-L flask is added a 6-cm egg-shaped magnetic stirring bar and 300 mL of hexane. The suspension is vigorously stirred for 24 h and filtered on a fritted glass funnel. The white solid is dried at 0.5 mmHg for 8 h to afford 23.75 g (73% yield from 3) of the desired product. The tosyloxycarbamate must be over 90% purity, as determined by GC/MS, to be used for the next step.
In a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser carrying a drying tube are placed 340 g. (4 moles) of cyanoacetic acid and 2 l. of anhydrous ether. To the stirred solution, 834 g. (4 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride is added in portions through the third neck of the flask, which is sealed between additions. The mixture is cooled occasionally with an ice bath to prevent excessive refluxing, and, after the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 0.5 hour or until the phosphorus pentachloride dissolves completely. The reflux condenser is removed and replaced with apparatus for downward distillation, and the ether is distilled from a water bath at 50–60°, after which most of the phosphorus oxychloride is removed at reduced pressure (20–25 mm. with a bath temperature of 55–65°), the receiver being cooled in an ice-salt bath. The red, oily residue is dissolved in 200 ml. of benzene and the benzene and residual phosphorus oxychloride distilled under reduced pressure. This operation is repeated with 200 ml. of fresh benzene to ensure complete removal of phosphorus oxychloride. The residue is then cooled to room temperature and is transferred to a 500-ml. pressure-equalized dropping funnel for immediate use in the following step.
In a 5-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a 30-ml. dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and thermometer extending down into the liquid is placed a suspension of paraformaldehyde (trioxymethylene, 125 g., 4.16 moles) in freshly distilled nitromethane (2.5 l., 46.6 moles). The suspension is stirred vigorously, and 3N methanolic potassium hydroxide solution is added dropwise from the dropping funnel until, at an apparent pH of 6–8, but closer to pH 8 (pH paper), the paraformaldehyde begins to dissolve and the suspension assumes a clearer appearance. About 10 ml. of the alkaline solution is required, and the addition takes about 10 minutes. About 15–20 minutes after addition of the alkaline solution is complete, the paraformaldehyde dissolves completely. Shortly thereafter, the solution temperature reaches a maximum of 13–14 degrees above room temperature and then slowly drops. Stirring is continued 1 hour after addition of the alkaline solution is complete.
To the mixture is added 120 ml. of toluene, stirring being continued for a few minutes. The toluene solution is separated from the aqueous solution and washed three times with water. The solution is filtered from suspended matter, and the toluene is distilled from a Claisen flask until a thermometer in the liquid reads 170°. The residue is then distilled under reduced pressure, the portion boiling at 118–123° at 1 mm. being collected. The yield of colorless o-n-heptylphenol is 45–47 g. (81–86%).
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a dropping funnel is charged with 35 g. (0.14 mole) of 1,3-dibenzoylpropane and a solution of 11.2 g. (0.280 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 400 ml. of methanol. The mixture is warmed to 45°, with stirring to dissolve the diketone. It is allowed to cool to 40°, and a solution of 35 g. (0.14 mole) of iodine in 200 ml. of methanol is slowly added to the stirred solution from the dropping funnel. After the addition of iodine is completed, the resulting clear solution is stirred at room temperature for 1.5 hours. During this period, a white solid precipitates. The mixture is filtered and the filtrate is placed in a round-bottomed flask. The white solid is washed with four, 100-ml. portions of water and dried at 1 mm. at 57° (1 mm.) for 15 hours, yielding 23–25 g. (66–72%) of trans-1,2-dibenzoylcyclopropane, m.p. 103–104°. Additional material is obtained on evaporation of the filtrate using a rotary evaporator. The pale-red solid residue is treated with 25 ml. of aqueous 10% sodium bisulfite, filtered, and dried as above giving 8–9 g. (23–26%) of the product, m.p. 95–98°. Recrystallization from methanol affords greater than 90% recovery of trans-1,2-dibenzoylcyclopropane, m.p. 102–103°. For the recrystallization of a 10-g. sample 200 ml. of methanol is used.
By continuing the distillation after removal of the cyclobutane anhydride, there is obtained 25–30 g. (7–9%) of propargylsuccinic anhydride; b.p. 162–168°/25 mm.; m.p. 63–68°. The melting point is raised to 69–70° by one recrystallization from 100 ml. of benzene (80% recovery of purified product).
Human hair is freed from foreign matter, washed well with a lukewarm solution of soap, then twice with cold distilled water, and dried. This washing removes the natural oils from the hair. Two kilos of the dry, washed hair is pushed into a 12-l. round-bottomed Pyrex flask, and 4 l. of 20 per cent hydrochloric acid is added. An air-cooled reflux condenser, consisting of a wide glass tube, is attached to the flask. The hair is hydrolyzed by heating on the steam bath until the biuret reaction is entirely negative; this requires one hundred twenty to one hundred forty-four hours.
Thirty grams (0.14 mole) of 2-methyldodecanoic acid is brominated exactly as described in the preparation of 2-methylenedodecanoic acid (p.616). The crude product, after the 18-hour heating period, is allowed to cool; then 56 ml. (1.4 moles) of commercial absolute methanol is added at such a rate that the exothermic reaction is kept under control. The resultant pale-orange two-phase mixture is heated under reflux with stirring for 15 minutes, cooled, and diluted with 150 ml. of water containing about 2 g. of sodium sulfite. The bromo ester is extracted with two portions (75 ml. and 25 ml.) of petroleum ether. The extracts are combined, washed with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by flash distillation of the filtered solution from a 250-ml. flask heated on a steam bath, and the last traces of solvent are eliminated by reducing the pressure with a water aspirator. The crude bromo ester remaining amounts to 41.5–42.5 g. and is thermally unstable to distillation at reduced pressure.
When the quinoline is heated to boiling by raising the bath temperature to about 250°, carbon dioxide is evolved at a moderate rate; the reaction is usually completed in 2–3 hours. Near the end of the reaction, heat is increased to about 265°, and the last distillate is collected until the temperature at the top of the column begins to rise rapidly above 65°. The contents of the receiver are decanted from any ice present and dried over about 1.5 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, followed by Drierite, in a tightly closed flask. Redistillation yields 13.5–14.5 g. (83–89%) of colorless 3-methylfuran, b.p. 65.5–66°, nD25 1.4295–1.4315 and.
In a 5-l. flask, fitted with stirrer, separatory funnel, exit tube, and thermometer, is placed 3.5 kg. (2 l., 30 moles) of chlorosulfonic acid, and to it is slowly added, with continuous stirring, 780 g. (888 cc., 10 moles) of benzene, keeping the temperature between 20° and 25° by means of cold water. The hydrogen chloride which is evolved is led to a hood or absorbed in water (Fig. 7, p. 97). The addition requires two to three hours; when this is complete, the mixture is stirred for one hour, and poured upon 6–7 kg. of crushed ice. One liter of carbon tetrachloride is then added, the oil is separated as soon as possible, and the watery layer is shaken with 500 cc. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined extracts are washed with dilute sodium carbonate, and the bulk of the carbon tetrachloride is distilled under atmospheric pressure; the pressure is then reduced and the benzenesulfonyl chloride collected at 113–115° /10 mm. (118–120° /15 mm.). The yield is 1320–1360 g. (75–77 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a colorless liquid which on cooling sets to a crystalline solid melting at 13–14°.
The mixed cyclopentenediols can be separated by distillation through a 60-cm. spinning band column. The yield of pure 3-cyclopentene-1,2-diol, b.p. 65–68°/1 mm., nD26 1.4941–1.4951, is 4.5–5.5 g., and the yield of pure 2-cyclopentene-1,4-diol, b.p. 92–95°/1 mm., nD26 1.5000–1.5010, is 17–20 g..
C. 3-Methylcoumarone. Dry 3-methylcoumarilic acid (50 g.) is distilled from a 250-ml. Claisen flask fitted with a long air condenser and immersed in a Wood's metal bath heated slowly to 280°. Carbon dioxide is evolved, and a cloudy liquid distils at 190–220°. The crude product is purified by redistillation through a Vigreux column. The clear colorless distillate, weighing 31.5–33 g. (84–88%), boils at 195–197°, nD25 1.5520.
The flask is then heated in an oil bath maintained at a temperature of 190–210° and the mixture is distilled with steam. The sulfonate groups are hydrolyzed in this process, and the bromophenol passes over as a heavy, colorless or pale yellow oil. In about one hour the distillate is clear. The product is extracted with ether, the ether is removed by distillation from the steam bath, and the residue is distilled at atmospheric pressure. The fraction boiling at 194–200° represents practically pure o-bromophenol. The yield is 70–75 g. (40–43 per cent of the theoretical amount). o-Bromophenol is a colorless liquid with a very characteristic odor. It is rather unstable and decomposes on standing, becoming brown or red in color.
B. 3,5-Dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoic acid. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and set upon a steam bath are placed 315 g. (1.25 moles) of ethyl 3,5-dichloro-4-hydroxybenzoate hydrate and 600 ml. of Claisen's alkali. Saponification is brought to completion by heating on the steam bath for 1 hour. A yellow homogeneous solution results which is diluted with 400 ml. of water and acidified to Congo red paper by pouring it into a rapidly stirred solution of 320 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 380 ml. of water in a 4-l. beaker. The thick white slurry is then cooled to 0–10°; the acid is collected on a 20-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with two 250-ml. portions of cold water. After being freed from as much water as possible by suction, the filter cake is broken up and dissolved in a boiling mixture of 1 l. of ethanol and 350 ml. of water. Cooling to 0° gives the first crop of crystals, weighing about 200 g. Concentration of the mother liquors to 750 ml. and cooling to 0° yields an additional 40–50 g. of product of equal purity. After drying in an oven at 85–95° for 8 hours, the white crystalline acid weighs 240–250 g. (93–97%) and melts at 266–268°.
To a stirred mixture of 16.51 g (0.1 mol) of L-phenylalanine in 60 mL of water and 60 mL of peroxide-free dioxane is added 21 mL of triethylamine. To the resulting solution is added 27.1 g (0.11 mol) of 2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxyimino)-2-phenylacetonitrile. Solution is obtained during the first hour of stirring. After 3 hr the solution is diluted with 150 mL of water. The resulting turbid solution is extracted with at least four 200-mL portions of ethyl ether. The aqueous layer is then acidified to pH 2.5 with cold 2.5 N hydrochloric acid to yield an oily layer. The mixture is extracted with three 100-mL portions of methylene chloride. The combined organic extracts are dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. After filtration of the sodium sulfate, the filtrate is evaporated under reduced pressure at a bath temperature of 30°C. Hexane is added to the thick oil to turbidity. Crystallization occurs after cooling and stirring the mixture for a short time. More hexane is added in portions until no further crystallization occurs. A total of 200 mL of hexane is required. The mixture is allowed to stand for 1 hr. The white crystalline solid is collected by filtration, washed with three 100-mL portions of hexane, and dried under reduced pressure to yield 21.4–22.0 g (80–83%) of tert-butoxycarbonyl-L-phenylalanine, mp 86–88°C, [α]D20 −3.6° (HOAc, c 1), [α]54620 29.9° [EtOH, c 1).
The stirring should be continued and the ice bath replaced by a hot-water bath, and the mixture refluxed gently for two hours. The flask is again cooled, and 30 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 350 cc. of water is added through the separatory funnel. This should be added slowly as long as heat is evolved. The contents of the flask are then transferred to a separatory funnel, the ether layer separated and dried over calcium chloride.
In a 5-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a dropping funnel, and an efficient reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube is placed 82 g. (3.5 gram atoms) of magnesium turnings. A solution of 459 g. (6 moles) of dry, freshly distilled allyl chloride in 2.4 l. of anhydrous ether is added to the flask through the dropping funnel in the following manner: A 100- to 200-ml. portion of the solution and a small crystal of iodine are added, and the mixture is warmed, if necessary, until the reaction starts. The remainder of the solution is added with stirring and cooling in an ice bath as rapidly as possible without loss of material through the condenser. By sponging the upper part of the flask with ice water from the cooling bath, the addition can be completed in 1–1.5 hours. When the addition is complete, the thick slurry is allowed to stand at room temperature for 5 hours with stirring for as much of that period as is practicable. The flask is again cooled in an ice bath, and a cold 5% solution of hydrochloric acid is added through the dropping funnel until the evolution of heat has practically ceased and the magnesium chloride is in solution. The mechanical stirrer is started again when the mixture becomes sufficiently fluid.
C. Docosanedioic acid. All the crude disodium 7,16-diketodocosanedioate of Step B is added to 1 l. of triethanolamine in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser, a thermometer, a mechanical stirrer, and a deep oil bath. The mixture is heated under reflux until all the salt dissolves (about 15 minutes). The solution is cooled to 130°, 610 ml. (10 moles) of 82% hydrazine hydrate is added through the reflux condenser, and the mixture is refluxed for 4 hours.
A mixture of 127.5 g. (1 mole) of a good commercial grade of o-chloroaniline and 300 ml. (2.5 moles) of 48% hydrobromic acid in a 2-l. flask set in an ice bath is cooled to 0° by the addition of ice. A solution of 70 g. (1 mole) of sodium nitrite in 125 ml. of water is added rapidly, with stirring, the temperature being kept below 10° by the addition of small pieces of ice. When only about 5 ml. of the sodium nitrite solution remains, further additions are made cautiously until an excess of nitrous acid remains after the last addition.
A. Diazabicyclooctane-hydrogen peroxide (DABCO · 2H2O2) complex. A 1-L, two-necked flask, fitted with a dropping funnel, 3-cm stirring bar, and a thermometer, is charged with diazabicyclooctane (DABCO) (28.05 g, 0.25 mol) dissolved in commercial grade tetrahydrofuran (THF) (375 mL). The flask is cooled to 0°C (internal temperature, ice-salt bath), and hydrogen peroxide (49 mL of a 35% solution, 0.5 mol) is slowly added at such a rate that the temperature remains constant, under vigorous stirring. A precipitate appears immediately and, after completing the addition of hydrogen peroxide, stirring is continued at 0°C for 1 hr. The mixture is then filtered through a Büchner funnel and the collected precipitate washed with cold THF (3 × 50 mL) and dried under reduced pressure (2 mm, 35–40°C) in a flask for 2 hr. The yield of DABCO · 2H2O2 obtained is 28.3 g (63%), m.p. 102–105°C (sealed tube) with decomposition, softness at 80°C (lit.3 m.p. 112°C).
C. Indazole. A mixture of 50 g. (0.41 mole) of 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroindazole, 35 g. of 5% palladium on carbon and 1 l. of dry decalin is placed in a 3-l. round-bottomed flask and heated under reflux for 24 hours. The hot mixture is filtered by suction, using a previously heated Büchner funnel, and the filtrate is allowed to cool. After standing overnight, the indazole that separates is collected by suction filtration, washed with 100 ml. of petroleum ether, and air-dried. The solid is dissolved in 750 ml. of hot benzene, and about 4 g. of decolorizing carbon is added. The mixture is filtered through a fluted filter paper and then is refiltered, using the same filter paper. Two liters of warm petroleum ether is added, and the solution is cooled in an ice bath for 2 hours. The indazole (m.p. 146–147°) is collected by suction filtration and after air drying weighs 24–25 g. (50–52%).
A. β,β'-Dibromoisobutyric acid. To a 5-L, single-necked flask, equipped with a heating mantle, 22-cm Vigreux distillation head, thermometer, 30-cm water-cooled condenser with adapter, and 1-L, ice-cooled receiving vessel is added 440 g (2.0 mol) of diethyl bis(hydroxymethyl)malonate2 and and 3540 mL of concentrated aqueous hydrobromic acid. Heating for 6 hr at vigorous reflux gives 2400 mL of aqueous distillate. The undistilled concentrate is poured into a 3-L beaker, cooled overnight at −15°C, and filtered through a 500-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel using aspirator vacuum. After suction air drying for 6 hr, drying is continued for 6 days in a vacuum desiccator containing active Drierite and under 10 mm of initial vacuum to give 332 g (67.5%) of β,β'-dibromoisobutyric acid as a brown solid. Distillation of the filtrate to remove an additional 850 mL of aqueous hydrobromic acid, followed by cooling and filtration, gives an additional 34.0 g (6.9%) of solid. Crude product, obtained in 74–85% yield3, is suitable for use without further purification.
In a 2.5-l. beaker, 100 g. (0.91 mole) of hydroquinone is dissolved in 2 l. of water heated to about 50°. After the solid is completely dissolved, the solution is cooled to 20°, 100 g. (54.4 cc.) of concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly poured in, and the mixture is again cooled to 20°. A concentrated solution of technical sodium dichromate is prepared by dissolving 140 g. (0.47 mole) in 65 cc. of water. This solution is then added gradually to the hydroquinone solution, with the use of a mechanical stirrer, the mixture being cooled so that the temperature never rises above 30°. At first a greenish-black precipitate forms, but, upon further addition of the sodium dichromate solution, the color changes to yellowish green. As soon as this color remains permanent (a slight excess of sodium dichromate does no harm) the reaction is complete. This requires about one-half to three-quarters of an hour; 90–110 cc. of sodium dichromate solution is necessary. The mixture is then cooled to about 10° and filtered with suction. As much water as possible is pressed out of the crystals.
(B) β-Bromoethylphthalimide.—In a 1-l. two-necked round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient stirrer and a reflux condenser are placed 150 g. (0.81 mole) of potassium phthalimide and 450 g. (2.4 moles) of ethylene dibromide. The stirrer is started and the mixture is heated for about twelve hours in an oil bath maintained at 180–190°. The condenser is then set for distillation, and the excess of ethylene dibromide is distilled under reduced pressure. The recovery of the bromide amounts to 290–295 g..
On completion of the methanol addition, the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes and filtered. Low-boiling material is stripped from the filtrate, and the residue is distilled through a 45-cm. Vigreux column at reduced pressure. There is a fore-run, b.p. 120–127° (3.5 mm.), that weighs about 5 g. Then 55–73 g. (61–81%) of diphenyl ketimine is collected at 127–128° (3.5 mm.) or 151–152° (8 mm.); n20D 1.6180–1.6191. The product should be stored under nitrogen to prevent yellowing.
The moist solid is suspended in 200 ml. of 10% aqueous potassium hydroxide solution, and the suspension is boiled for 5 minutes. The hot solution is filtered, and the remaining solid is again extracted, using 100 ml. of potassium hydroxide solution.
B. 7-Benzylideneaminotheophylline. A 2000-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with an efficient mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and drying tube, is charged with 600 mL of anhydrous N-methylpyrrolidone and 20.2 g (0.1 mol) of anhydrous theophylline sodium salt. The flask is cooled with an ice–salt bath to 0°C (internal temperature). Then 23.4 g (0.1 mol) of O-diphenylphosphinylhydroxylamine is added in three equal portions while the suspension is stirred vigorously. After the ice–salt bath is removed, the resulting viscous suspension is stirred for 6 hr at 20°C.
The solution is again brought to a boil and the calculated amount of silver oxide is added to remove the last of the chlorides. The silver chloride is filtered off and the lead is precipitated with hydrogen sulfide. After filtering off the lead sulfide, a light strawcolored solution remains.
To a solution of 25 g. of mercuric chloride in 500 cc. of water in a 5-l. flask, 800 g. of cracked ice is added. A cold solution of 190 g. of sodium hydroxide in 500 cc. of water is added, and a rapid stream of chlorine is passed into the mixture, which must be kept below 5°. The addition of chlorine is continued in this way until the yellow precipitate of mercuric oxide just disappears. Then 1600 cc. of cold nitric acid (1.5 N) is added slowly, with stirring.
The entire reaction mixture is then subjected to fractional distillation through a Widmer column. The material boiling up to 120° is removed at atmospheric pressure and discarded. The contents of the flask are cooled and the pressure reduced to 7 mm. The fraction up to 80°/7 mm. is removed and discarded. The material boiling at 80–90°/7 mm. is collected, and, after the contents of the flask have been cooled, the pressure is reduced to 2 mm. and all the material boiling up to 110°/2 mm. is collected and combined with the 80–90°/7 mm. fraction. The next fraction, boiling at 110–138°/2 mm., is collected separately. On refractionation of the lower fraction (b.p. 80°/7 mm.–110°/2 mm.) there is obtained 13–15 g. of o-hydroxyacetophenone (b.p. 87–88°/7 mm.). To the residue after recovery of the o-hydroxyacetophenone is added the fraction boiling at 110–138°/2 mm. The pressure is again reduced to 2 mm. and the fraction boiling at 124–126°/2 mm. collected. This fraction is pure 2-ethylchromone and weighs 42–45 g. (70–75% based on the ketone not recovered).
A. 4,4'-Bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2,2'-bipyridine . A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet, magnetic stirrer, and rubber septum is charged with tetrahydrofuran (THF) (90 mL) and diisopropylamine (9.8 mL, 69.7 mmol). The reaction mixture is cooled to −78°C and a solution of butyllithium (n-BuLi) (1.7 M in hexanes, 36.0 mL, 61.4 mmol) is added. The solution is stirred at −78°C for 10 min, warmed to 0°C and stirred for 10 min, then cooled back to −78°C. A solution of 4,4'-dimethyl-2,2'-bipyridine (5.14 g, 27.9 mmol) in THF (130 mL), prepared in a 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask under a nitrogen atmosphere, is added via cannula to the cold lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution. The resulting maroon-black reaction mixture is stirred at −78°C for 1 hr, then chlorotrimethylsilane (TMSCl) (8.85 mL, 69.7 mmol) is rapidly added via syringe. After the solution becomes pale blue-green (≈10 sec after the TMSCl addition), the reaction is quenched by rapid addition of absolute ethanol (10 mL).. The cold reaction mixture is poured into a separatory funnel (1 L) containing aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3, ≈200 mL) and allowed to warm to ≈25°C. The product is extracted with dichloromethane (CH2Cl2, 3 × 300 mL); the combined organic fractions are shaken with brine (≈200 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate (Na2SO4). Filtration and concentration on a rotary evaporator affords 8.85 g (97%) of 4,4'-bis[(trimethylsilyl)methyl]-2,2'-bipyridine as a slightly off-white crystalline solid.
An oven-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen gas inlet, magnetic stirring bar, dropping funnel, thermometer, and condenser, under an inert nitrogen atmosphere, is placed in an ice bath and charged, while stirring, with 500 mL of pyridine and 17.79 g of cycloheptatrienylium tetrafluoroborate 1 2 (0.1 mol) at 0°C. Bromomalononitrile (14.49 g, 0.1 mol) is added drop by drop within a 10-min period, and the mixture is vigorously stirred at that temperature for 1 hr. The ice bath is replaced by a water bath, the temperature is gradually raised to 40°C, and the stirring mixture is kept at that temperature for 5 hr. The solvent is distilled off under reduced pressure below 40°C. To the resultant residue, 1 L of chloroform (CHCl3) is added and the solution is filtered to remove insoluble pyridinium tetrafluoroborate . The chloroform solution is evaporated to remove a trace amount of pyridine, and the residue is chromatographed with Wakogel C-300 (400 g) and chloroform. The red solution that is eluted is evaporated and the mass obtained recrystallized from ethanol to yield 12.34 g (80.0% of 8,8-dicyanoheptafulvene , 2, red needles, mp 199-200°C (lit.3 198-199°C, lit.4 201-202°C).
The benzene and other low-boiling materials are removed by distillation at 40–50 mm. pressure until the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 90°. The n-butyl phosphate fraction is collected at 160–162°/15 mm., or 143–145°/8 mm., and weighs 190–200 g. (71–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. (+)-(1S)-10-Camphorsulfonamide. Into a 2-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a 250-mL dropping funnel, a magnetic stirring bar, and a reflux condenser fitted with an outlet connected to a disposable pipette dipped in 2 mL of chloroform in a test tube for monitoring gas evolution, were placed 116 g (0.5 mol) of camphorsulfonic acid and 750 mL of reagent-grade chloroform. The suspension of camphorsulfonic acid was heated to reflux and 71.4 g (43.77 mL, 0.6 mol, 1.2 equiv) of freshly distilled thionyl chloride was added dropwise over a 1-hr period. Heating was continued until gas evolution (sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride) had ceased (approximately 9–10 hr). The resultant solution of camphorsulfonyl chloride in chloroform was converted to camphorsulfonamide without further purification.
B. α,α'-Dibromodibenzyl sulfone. To a gently refluxing solution of 11.35 g. (0.05304 mole) of dibenzyl sulfide in 150 ml. of carbon tetrachloride contained in a three-necked, round-bottomed flask is added, dropwise over a period of 1.5 hours, a solution of 17.6 g. (0.0978 mole) of bromine in 50 ml. of carbon tetrachloride, while a sunlamp is focused on the reaction mixture from a distance of 1 in. The solution is refluxed with a heating mantle for 3 hours, and the carbon tetrachloride removed at a water bath temperature of 50° with the aid of a water aspirator. To the residual dark oil is added 25 ml. of anhydrous diethyl ether, and after cooling in an ice bath a solution of 32.5 (0.189 mole) of m-chloroperbenzoic acid in 150 ml. of anhydrous ether is added dropwise over a 30-minute period. The mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 2 days.
The catalyst is removed by filtration with gentle suction through a thin layer of Celite. The flask is rinsed with 30 ml. of hot alcohol which is then used to wash the catalyst and Celite. The combined filtrates are concentrated under reduced pressure to about 50 ml. and then heated to boiling at atmospheric pressure. When 250 ml. of hot water is added slowly, 2-aminofluorene is precipitated as a colorless, crystalline powder. After cooling in an ice bath, the 2-aminofluorene is collected, washed with water, and dried in the dark in a vacuum desiccator. The product melts at 127.8–128.8° and amounts to 24–25 g. (93–96%).
A 750-ml. portion of this suspension of crude adamantanone is transferred to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask, equipped for steam distillation and, which is placed in a heating mantle. The contents of the distillation flask are heated to 70°; the external heating is turned off and steam is introduced carefully through both inlet tubes. The two layers of distillate are separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-ml. portions of dichloromethane. This steam distillation procedure is then repeated with the second half of the suspension of crude adamantanone. The organic extracts are combined, washed with 100 ml. of aqueous, saturated sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and evaporated under reduced pressure, yielding 52–53 g.. (47–48%) of adamantanone,, and.
In a large evaporating dish is placed 252 g. (2 moles) of crystalline oxalic acid. The acid is heated on a steam bath for six to eight hours, with occasional stirring, until all the water of crystallization (72 g.) has been expelled. The oxalic acid, which is almost anhydrous (weighing approximately 180 g.), is placed in a 1.5-l. round-bottomed flask, A, containing 500 cc. of absolute alcohol (p. 249) and fitted up as shown in Fig. 14.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 750 g. (8.1 moles) of aniline and 1 kg. (8.2 moles) of benzoic acid. When about two-thirds of the benzoic acid is in the flask the mixture is melted to make room for the rest. The flask is placed in a large oil bath and connected to a condenser for distillation. The temperature of the oil is raised quickly to 180–190°, at which point distillation starts. The bath is held at this temperature until practically no more aniline and water distil (about two hours), and then the temperature is slowly raised to 225° and maintained at this temperature until no further distillation takes place (one to two hours). The oil bath is now removed and the contents of the flask are allowed to cool below 180° and 550 g. (5.9 moles) of aniline is added. The distillations at 190° and 225° are repeated (about six hours). The hot mixture is poured into two 20-cm. evaporating dishes (Hood) and is allowed to cool. The crude product weighs 1600–2000 g., depending on the amount of aniline retained.
One kilogram (2.5 moles) of iodoform is placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a rubber stopper holding a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a separatory funnel, and a thermometer with bulb immersed in the liquid. To this is added 500 cc. of the sodium arsenite solution [prepared from 274 g. (1.38 moles) of c. p. arsenious oxide, 532 g. (13.3 moles) of sodium hydroxide, and 2600 cc. of water]. Stirring is started, and heat is applied until the temperature of the thermometer reaches 60–65°, where it is held constant during the whole reaction. If the temperature is allowed to go much higher, especially at the beginning of the experiment, the reaction becomes too vigorous, and at the same time a little methyl iodide is formed. The remainder of the sodium arsenite solution is added gradually during the course of one-half hour. The whole mixture is then kept one hour at 60–65° to make sure that the reaction is completed.
The crude fractions are combined and distilled at atmospheric pressure through a good column; about 95 per cent distils at 118–122° as a colorless liquid. The methoxyacetonitrile so prepared weighs 100–110 g. (70–77 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. Ethynyl p-tolyl sulfone. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a thermometer, a 500-mL addition funnel, a nitrogen inlet, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with p-tolyl 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethynyl sulfone (25.2 g, 0.1 mol) and 300 mL of reagent-grade methanol. After the mixture is stirred for 30 min, a clear solution is obtained. In the addition funnel is placed 350 mL of an aqueous solution containing potassium carbonate (6.2 × 10−3 M) and potassium bicarbonate (6.2 × 10−3 M); this buffer is added at a rate to maintain the reaction temperature at 30°C and. The mixture is diluted with water (200 mL), and extracted with four 100-mL portions of chloroform. The combined organic phases are washed 3 times with water (100 mL) and twice with brine (100 mL) prior to drying over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of solvent under reduced pressure leaves a creamy white solid, which is purified by either recrystallization from ethyl acetate–petroleum ether or silica gel chromatography using 10% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether as eluant. There is obtained 15.0 g (83%) of colorless crystals, mp 74–75°C and.
The distillation at atmospheric pressure is then discontinued, the liquid is allowed to cool somewhat, and distillation is continued at a pressure of 3–10 mm. After a fore-run of less than 20 g., n-caproic anhydride is collected (b.p. 109–112°/3 mm., 118–121°/6 mm.). The yield is 86–95 g. (80–87%).
B. 2,5,5-Trimethyl-2-(2-bromoethyl)-1,3-dioxane (2). A 1-L, three-necked flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a gas inlet tube. In the flask are placed 700 mL of dichloromethane, 140 g (2.00 mol) of methyl vinyl ketone, and 0.010 g of dicinnamalacetone indicator. Anhydrous hydrogen bromide is bubbled into the solution with stirring until the indicator changes to deep red. The gas inlet tube is removed and 208 g (2.00 mol) of neopentanediol, 296 g (2.00 mol) of triethyl orthoformate, and 0.67 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate are added to the solution. The flask is stoppered and stirred at room temperature for 1–2 hr and then concentrated by rotary evaporation. The concentrated solution is washed twice with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution. (Caution! There is some foaming.) The bicarbonate washes are extracted three times with dichloromethane and the combined organic portions dried over anhydrous K2CO3. Rotary evaporation followed by vacuum distillation of the residue through a 30-cm Vigreux column yields 256 g (54%) of 2 as a clear, colorless oil, bp 65°C (0.3 mm), nD3 1.4687.
B. Benzyl isocyanide. In a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a pressure-equalizing funnel are placed 5-benzylaminotetrazole (10.5 g, 60 mmol), 100 mL of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and 70 mL of dichloromethane. The mixture is cooled to 0°C and a solution of NaOBr in water (165 mL, 65 mmol) is added with vigorous stirring over a 15-min period. The dichloromethane layer is separated and the aqueous phase extracted with five 50-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane extracts are dried over anhydrous MgSO4, the drying agent is removed by filtration, and the dichloromethane is removed by simple distillation. The pressure is then reduced to ~20 mm with an aspirator and benzyl isocyanide is distilled at 98–100°C; yield: 5.91 g (84%) and.
A. 1-Trimethylsiloxycyclopentene.2 A 1-L, two-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser having a drying tube (calcium chloride). The flask is charged with 200 mL of dimethylformamide, 45 g (0.54 mol) of cyclopentanone, 65.5 g (0.6 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane, and 185 mL (1.33 mol) of triethylamine, and the mixture is refluxed for 17 hr. The mixture is cooled, diluted with 350 mL of pentane, and washed four times with 200-mL portions of cold saturated aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. The aqueous phases are extracted twice with 100-mL portions of pentane and the combined organic phases are washed rapidly with 100 mL of ice–cold aqueous 2 N HCl and immediately thereafter with a cold saturated solution of sodium hydrogen carbonate. After the mixture has been dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the pentane is removed by rotary evaporation. Distillation of the oily residue at 60°C (12 mm) using a 20-cm Vigreux column affords 50.1–51.6 g (60–62%) of 1-trimethylsiloxycyclopentene (1) as a colorless liquid.
Immediately after the addition of the last portion of ammonium hydroxide, the reflux condenser and stirrer are removed and the flask is connected to the steam-distillation assembly. The mixture is steam-distilled as rapidly as possible, and two 250-ml. fractions of distillate are collected during a period of 10–13 minutes. The first fraction is saturated with sodium chloride, and the solution is stirred at 5° until precipitation appears to be complete. The solid is collected on a Büchner funnel and dried in the air. The product weighs 2.72–3.11 g. (57–65%) and melts at 38–39°. The second fraction of the distillate is saturated with sodium chloride and combined with the filtrate remaining from the first fraction. The combined solution is extracted with two 45-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is filtered, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation, finally under reduced pressure. The residue solidifies on cooling and weighs 0.6–1.0 g.; it can be purified by steam distillation from 40–50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution until 100 ml. of distillate is collected, saturation of the distillate with sodium chloride, cooling, and filtration. The pure product so obtained weighs 0.42–0.87 g. The total yield is 3.3–3.6 g. (69–75%).

The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C and 3-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl chloride (3.3 g, 16.2 mmol) is added dropwise to the stirred solution over 30 min. After the addition, the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction is quenched with 80 mL of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate , the phases are separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with dichloromethane (2 × 200 mL). The combined organic extracts are washed with brine (2 × 100 mL) and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . After filtration, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow oil. Purification by flash column chromatography ( 140 g of silica gel) and eluting with 25% ethyl acetate in hexanes gives a white solid that can be recrystallized from ethyl acetate/hexanes to yield 1,3,5-O-tribenzoyl-2-O-[(3-trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]-α-D-ribofuranose (5.62 g, 82% yield) as white crystals, mp 109-111°C (lit.2 mp 102°C).
The crude thiophosgene is separated and dried with about 10 g. of calcium chloride, and fractionated with a good column. Very little distils below 73°. The fraction boiling at 73–76° at atmospheric pressure is pure thiophosgene and amounts to about 180 g. (24 per cent of the theoretical amount). The fraction above 76° is largely thiocarbonyl perchloride and may be again reduced or added to the reduction in a subsequent run.
B. Cyclopropanone ethyl hemiacetal. Into a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar is placed 250 mL of reagent-grade methanol. Freshly distilled 1-ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane (100 g, 0.56 mol) is added all at once to the methanol and the solution is stirred overnight (12 hr) at room temperature. An aliquot (50 mL) of the solution is concentrated by slow evaporation of methanol with a rotary evaporator at room temperature and formation of the methanolysis product is checked by NMR examination of the residue. When the reaction is complete, the solution is concentrated by removal of the methanol. Distillation of the residue through a 20-cm helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column under reduced pressure gives 52 g (89%) of 1-ethoxycyclopropanol, bp 60°C (20 mm) and, which contains trace amounts of 1-methoxycyclopropanol and.

The flask is fitted with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus containing a thimble with 30 g of an oven-dried Na2CO3 and sand mixture in a 3:1 ratio. An additional 50 mL of chlorobenzene is added to partially fill the thimble-chamber of the Soxhlet apparatus. The mixture is refluxed at 185 °C (external temperature) open to the atmosphere, and after only 15 min the color of the solution turns from green to dark blue. After 10 h the vessel is removed from the oil bath, the Soxhlet extraction apparatus is removed, and the solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to yield a blue, glass-like solid residue. 2-Propanol (100 mL) is added to the same flask, and the solid residue is mixed vigorously with 2-propanol for 30 seconds using a metal spatula to dissolve chlorobenzene that is entrapped in the residue. The 2-propanol is evaporated from the solid residue under reduced pressure to give a purple powder suitable for filtration. Acetone (100 mL) is added to dissolve excess e-caprolactam contained in the powder, and the solid is gravity-filtered through a Büchner funnel and then washed with an additional 50 mL of acetone. The filtered purple solid is transferred to a pre-weighed, 250-mL round-bottomed flask and dried under high vacuum (0.1 mmHg) for 1 h to yield 3.52 g of a dull purple powder. To render the powder catalytically active the solid is recrystallized from 66 mL of boiling acetonitrile/methanol (10:1) to give 1.65 g (50% yield) of Rh2(cap)4(CH3CN)2 (1) as shiny deep purple crystals.

Completion of the oxidation is determined by TLC and the reaction mixture is filtered through a 150-mL sintered-glass funnel of coarse porosity to remove solids. The filtrate is transferred to a 3-L separatory funnel, the toluene phase is separated and the aqueous phase is washed with methylene chloride (3 × 100 mL). The filtered solids and any solids remaining in the Morton flask are washed with an additional 200 mL of methylene chloride. The organic extracts are combined and washed with 100 mL of saturated sodium sulfite, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 15–20 min, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator.

About 10 ml. of the above diazonium salt solution is added. After the frothing has subsided, the diazonium salt solution is added in 10- to 20-ml. portions over a period of about an hour. The temperature of the reaction mixture is kept below 15° during this period by the addition of ice. After the diazonium salt solution has been added, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, and the stirring is continued for an additional hour.

To this mixture is added the in situ prepared (R)-BINAP-Ru(II) complex (175 mg) under a stream of argon. The resulting yellowish orange solution is further degassed by two freeze-thaw cycles and then transferred by cannula to a dry, argon-filled, 500-mL glass autoclave equipped with a gas inlet tube, a septa-covered stop valve, and pressure gauge. The gas inlet tube is attached to a hydrogen source and the air originally present in this tube and the autoclave is replaced by evacuation (to ca. 20 mm) and refilling with hydrogen five times. Hydrogen is introduced into the reaction vessel until the pressure gauge indicates 3 atm. The pressure is carefully released to 1 atm by opening the stop valve. This procedure is repeated three times, and finally hydrogen is pressurized to 4 atm. The yellowish orange solution is vigorously stirred at 100°C for 6 hr during which time the hydrogen cylinder is kept connected. After the main valve of the hydrogen cylinder is closed, the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, excess hydrogen is carefully bled off, and the apparatus is disassembled. The deep reddish orange contents are placed in a 300-mL, round-bottomed flask, and the glass autoclave is rinsed with three 20-mL portions of dichloromethane. The solvent is removed by a rotary evaporator, and the residue is distilled to give 47–49 g (92–96% yield) of (R)-(−)-methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate in 97–98% ee as a fraction boiling at 40°C, 2 mm.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube, and a dropping funnel, is placed 123 g. (1 mole) of nicotinic acid. The stirrer is started, and 500 ml. (818 g., 6.9 moles) of distilled thionyl chloride is added in a slow stream over a period of 15–20 minutes. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated on the steam bath with continuous stirring for 1 hour; then the reflux condenser is replaced by one set for downward distillation, and the excess thionyl chloride is removed by distillation at reduced pressure as heating on the steam bath is continued and. After most of the thionyl chloride has been distilled, 200 ml. of anhydrous benzene is added, and the benzene is distilled at reduced pressure. An additional 500 ml. of anhydrous benzene is added; then the flask is fitted with a thermometer and a reflux condenser and is placed in an ice-salt bath. The stirrer is started, and 330 g. (2.5 moles) of anhydrous aluminum chloride is added in portions over a period of 1 hour as the internal temperature is held between 5° and 10°. The ice bath is removed, and the flask is permitted to warm to room temperature and is finally heated under reflux for 6 hours.
A. 1-(4-Bromophenyl)ethanone oxime (1). A 1000-mL single-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a 7 cm magnetic stir bar, a 50-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter, and an ice-water bath, is charged with 1-(4-bromophenyl)ethanone (50.0 g, 251 mmol, 1 equiv), hydroxylamine hydrochloride (37.0 g, 532 mmol, 2.1 equiv) and denatured ethanol (375 mL). Pyridine (37.5 mL, 465 mmol, 1.85 equiv) is charged through the pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to the suspension over 5 min. Once the addition is complete, the dropping funnel is replaced by a water-cooled condenser fitted with a nitrogen inlet adapter. The ice-water bath is replaced by an oil bath and the reaction mixture is heated at reflux under nitrogen for 4 h. After this period, the flask is removed from the oil bath and is placed in an ice-water bath until the internal temperature cools to approximately 20 °C Temperature of the mixture was determined by addition of a thermometer to the flask after approximately 10 min of cooling. The magnetic stir bar is removed and the reaction mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (60 °C, 35-40 mmHg) to remove ethanol and other volatiles (~370 mL) to provide a solid residue. The flask is equipped with 7 cm magnetic stir bar and a 500-mL pressure equalizing dropping funnel. Water (375 mL) is charged to the mixture through the dropping funnel over 15 min. The resulting slurry is stirred at room temperature for 1 h, then vacuum-filtered on a 9-cm Büchner funnel (fitted with Whatman-1 filter paper, 90 mm), washed with water (2 x 25 mL) and suction dried (approx. 10 min). The solid is transferred to a 250-mL beaker and dried under vacuum (~130 mmHg) at 65 °C for 12 h to afford the title compound 1 as a white solid (53.0-53.1 g, 99%).
(A) Cyclohexanone Oxime.—In a 5-l. flask, fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer and an 8-mm. glass inlet tube reaching to within 5 cm. of the bottom of the flask, are placed 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and a solution of 182 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium nitrite (95 per cent) in 500 cc. of water. The flask is placed in an ice-salt mixture, and a cold (−8°) solution of sodium bisulfite, prepared by saturating with sulfur dioxide a solution of 143 g. (1.35 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 600 cc. of water, is added. While the temperature is kept below 0°, a moderate stream of sulfur dioxide is passed into the mixture until it is acid to Congo red and then just enough longer to remove the dark color which appears shortly before the solution becomes acid.
The reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hours at the ice-bath temperature and then is allowed to warm to room temperature overnight while the stirring is continued. During this period the color of the mixture changes from yellow-orange to brown.
At a pyrolysis oven temperature of 630°C, an evaporator temperature of 200°C, and a pressure of 12 mm, 2-toluic acid chloride (240 g, 1.55 mol) is added in about 2.5 hr at a constant rate of 40–60 drops/min. The pressure should be monitored in the addition funnel C during the pyrolysis. A sudden rise in pressure indicates that a restriction is building up between the pyrolysis reactor and the pump. In this case addition of reactant must be stopped. Ten minutes after the addition is complete the apparatus is flushed with nitrogen. The dark brown, oily condensate in the receiver is dissolved in 500 mL of acetone and diluted with 250 mL of cold water and. The homogeneous solution is stirred at room temperature for 1 hr. It then is separated into two phases by the addition of 500 mL of 2 N sodium carbonate solution and 250 mL of ether. The aqueous layers are extracted twice with 250-mL portions of ether. The ether extracts are washed with 2 N sodium carbonate solution and with saturated sodium chloride solution. The combined ether layers are dried over sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvent and distillation of the residue yields 65 g of a yellow oil, bp 87–90°C/13 mm, with the following composition: Benzocyclobutenone (97%), benzyl chloride (3%). Fractionation at 12 mm through a 25-cm spinning band column gives 58 g of benzocyclobutenone (>99%) as a colorless oil, bp 84–86°C/12 mm and. The product crystallizes at 0°C and then melts at 10–15°C.
The hot mixture is poured, with stirring, into 15 l. of warm water (50–60°), and is followed by 700 cc. (8.2 moles) of concentrated (36 per cent) hydrochloric acid. After standing until the layers are distinct (ten to fifteen minutes), the lower layer is siphoned off as completely as possible and the oil is washed with two 1-l. portions of warm water.
B. 1-Trimethylsilyloxybicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one. A 1-L, four-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, adapter with internal temperature probe, reflux condenser with nitrogen inlet, and a septum with nitrogen outlet is purged with nitrogen, then charged with 2-propanol (350 mL, Note 3) and nitrogen is bubbled through the solvent for 15 min via a 30-cm, 18 gauge needle. The mechanical stirrer, fitted with a 60 X 20 mm Teflon paddle, is started at 120–150 rpm. 1-Trimethylsilyloxy-7,7-dichlorobicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-6-one (29.9 g, 112 mmol) is dissolved in 50 mL of 2-propanol (gentle heating is required) and added to the reaction flask, rinsing with an additional 50 mL, then 20 mL of 2-propanol. Nitrogen is then bubbled through the solution for 15 min. The septum is removed and replaced with a glass funnel, through which 10% Pd/C (5.98 g, 50% w/w in water) is added, the septum is replaced, and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The septum is removed again, replaced with a glass funnel, and sodium formate is added in a single portion (38.1 g, 559 mmol, 5.0 equiv, Note 3), rinsing with 25 mL of 2-propanol The septum is replaced and nitrogen is bubbled through the solution for 5 min. The flask is heated in an oil bath to an internal temperature of 80 °C, and is maintained at this temperature with stirring for 18 h. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature and a 60-μL aliquot is removed and diluted with 600 μL of ether. A 4-μL sample of this solution is analyzed by GC, and shows complete conversion. The slurry is filtered with suction through a pad of Celite (8 cm diameter sintered glass funnel, 350 mL volume, with a 4 cm pad of Celite), into a 1-L filter flask rinsing with four 50-mL portions of 2-propanol. The filtrate is concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to a cloudy, yellow oil, which is then diluted with 150 mL of methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE, Note 3) and then is transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The organic phase is washed with three portions of half-saturated brine (75 mL each), once with saturated brine, then is dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on the rotary evaporator (25 mmHg, room temperature water bath) to provide the product as a clear, orange oil (17.2 g, 86.7 mmol, 77% yield) with traces of MTBE and 2-propanol. This material is used without further purification in the next reaction.
The solution is now saturated with salt and distilled with steam. About 2 l. of distillate is required before all of the 2-chlorocyclohexanol passes over. The distillate is saturated with salt and the oily layer separated. The aqueous layer is extracted once with about 250 cc. of ether. This is added to the main portion, which is dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The ether is removed by distillation and the product distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 88–90°/20 mm. (104–106°/45 mm.) is collected. The yield is 142–148 g. (70–73 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 625 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol, 500 cc. of water, 500 g. (476 cc., 4.7 moles) of pure benzaldehyde, and 50 g. of sodium cyanide (96–98 per cent). The mixture is then heated and kept boiling for one-half hour. In the course of about twenty minutes, crystals begin to separate from the hot solution. At the end of the thirty minutes, the solution is cooled, filtered with suction, and washed with a little water. The yield of dry crude benzoin, which is white or light yellow, is 450–460 g. (90–92 per cent of the theoretical amount). In order to obtain it completely pure, the crude substance is recrystallized from 95 per cent alcohol, 90 g. of crude material being dissolved in about 700 cc. of boiling alcohol; upon cooling, a yield of 83 g. of white, pure benzoin which melts at 129° is obtained.
The washed chloride is dissolved in 140 cc. of glacial acetic acid at 50–60°, and the solution is quickly filtered by suction. The filtrate is chilled by immersing the flask in cold water and is vigorously stirred in order to cause the sulfonyl chloride to separate in fine crystals. The mixture is now triturated thoroughly with a liter of cold water which is then decanted into a large Büchner funnel. The process is repeated twice. Finally, a liter of cold water is added to the mixture, and then 10 cc. of concentrated ammonium hydroxide (sp. gr. 0.90) is added, with stirring. The crystals are collected at once on the filter, washed with 200 cc. of water, and allowed to dry in the air. The yield is 240 g. (84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a light yellow product, melting at 64–65°. This material may be used without further purification (and without being dried) for the preparation of orthanilic acid.
(B) Condensation with Benzaldehyde.—To 400 cc. (1.06 moles) of the sodium cyanoacetate solution is added a solution of 5 g. (0.13 mole) of sodium hydroxide in 400 cc. of water. The resulting alkaline solution is warmed to 40° and treated with 100 g. (0.94 mole) of benzaldehyde which has been shaken with sodium carbonate solution and distilled under reduced pressure. The benzaldehyde dissolves after vigorous shaking for a few minutes. After standing one hour, during which time some of the sodium cyanophenylacrylate crystallizes, the mixture is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid until acid to litmus and 40 cc. additional concentrated acid added, and the whole is shaken vigorously. After another hour, the crystalline cyanophenylacrylic acid is filtered on a Büchner funnel, washed thoroughly with cold water, and dried in a steam oven. It is then shaken with 100 cc. of benzene, filtered on a Büchner funnel, and further washed with 50 cc. of benzene and dried. The yield of product melting at 178–179° is 105–115 g. (65–70 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product may have a slight pinkish color, which can be removed by recrystallization from 740 cc. of alcohol or 10 l. of hot water. The recovery is about 57 per cent from alcohol and 92 per cent from water. The melting point remains unchanged.
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Trubore stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser with a drying tube is charged with 350 ml. of acetonitrile and 106.4 g. (0.41 mole) of triphenylphosphine. The flask is cooled in an ice-water bath, and 64 g. (0.40 mole) of bromine is added dropwise over a period of ca. 15–20 minutes and. The ice-water bath is removed, and a solution of 54 g. (0.40 mole) of cinnamyl alcohol in 50 ml. of acetonitrile is added in portions over a period of 5–10 minutes with continued stirring. The solvent is removed by distillation with the use of a water aspirator (30–40 mm.) and an oil bath until the bath temperature reaches 120°. The water aspirator is replaced by a vacuum pump and the water-cooled condenser with an air condenser, and the distillation is continued with rapid stirring,, and. Most of the product distills at 91–98° (2–4 mm.), and about 59 g. of product crystallizes in the receiving flask (63–75% yield).
B. 3-Vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine. An oven-dried, 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a calcium chloride drying tube, and two rubber septa. The flask is charged with 41.45 g (0.3 mol) of 1,2-benzenedimethanol, 5.71 g (0.03 mol) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, and 600 mL of dry 1,2-dimethoxyethane and. Stirring is initiated, and 49.2 mL (0.45 mol) of trimethyl orthoformate and 30.1 mL (0.45 mol) of acrolein are then added sequentially via syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 5 hr, then poured into a mixture of ice and 150 mL of aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate solution in a 2-L separatory funnel using 90 mL of ether to rinse the flask. After thorough mixing, the organic phase is separated and the aqueous phase is extracted with 300 mL of ether. The combined organic layers are washed sequentially with 90 mL of cold aqueous 10% sodium bicarbonate solution and 90 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 52 g (99%) of crude acetal. Distillation of the residual liquid under reduced pressure affords 39.6–40.4 g (75–77%) of 3-vinyl-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine as a colorless liquid, bp 116–118°C (5 mm), that may crystallize on standing, mp ~30°C and.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 100 g. (1.06 moles) of trimethylene cyanide (p. 536) and 500 g. (424 cc., 4.8 moles) of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18). The mixture is refluxed for about four hours and then the solution is evaporated to dryness, preferably under reduced pressure. The dry residue, consisting of glutaric acid and ammonium chloride, is extracted with about 300 cc. of boiling ether. The ether solution is filtered and the residue is further extracted with two 100-cc. portions of boiling ether. The combined ether extracts containing the glutaric acid are evaporated to about 150–200 cc., whereupon the acid begins to crystallize. Then 1 l. of benzene is added, and the mixture is heated until the glutaric acid dissolves. On cooling in an ice-salt bath, the acid crystallizes. The first crop weighs 103–105 g.. The filtrate is concentrated to about one-third its original volume and cooled, whereupon a second crop of 13–14 g. of pure glutaric acid is obtained. The total yield is thus 116–119 g. (83–85 per cent of the theoretical amount) of a product melting at 97–98°.
The octyl hydrogen phthalate is filtered, washed with water, ground thoroughly with water in a mortar, and finally filtered and dried. For complete purification it may be crystallized either from petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°) or glacial acetic acid, from which it separates as needles melting at 55°. The crude material, however, is perfectly satisfactory for the following experiments. The yield is nearly quantitative if the sec.-octyl alcohol is pure and.
The yellow product is decolorized by dissolving it in an equal volume of carbon tetrachloride (ca. 12 ml.) and vigorously shaking the solution thus obtained with 1.5 ml. of freshly prepared aqueous 35% sodium thiosulfate. The two layers are completely separated after 5 minutes. The colorless bottom layer is drawn off into a 50-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. The top layer is extracted three times with 1.5 ml. of carbon tetrachloride. The combined carbon tetrachloride extracts are dried over 0.5 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 minutes. The solution is filtered into a 50-ml. anhydrous magnesium sulfate for 30 minutes. The solution is filtered into a 50-ml. distilling flask, and the magnesium sulfate is washed several times with carbon tetrachloride (total 5 ml.). The solvent is removed, and the colorless product is distilled as described above, affording 14.7–15.8 g. (69–74% overall, based on hexanoic acid; 88–92% for the decolorization step) of colorless 2-bromohexanoyl chloride, b.p. 45–47° (1.5 mm.), n22D 1.4706, d244 1.4017 and.
The pantoyl lactone thus obtained (25.41 g), [α]D25 −40.8° (80.5% e.e.) is refluxed with 75 mL benzene and 290 mL of UV-grade hexanes. The cloudy solution is stirred briskly overnight as solids form. Filtration of the solids and drying for 3 hr at 0.25 mm, 30°C in a vacuum oven affords 21.51 g of product; [α]D25 −47.7° (94.27% e.e.). This material is again refluxed and crystallized from 30 mL of benzene and 116 mL of UV-grade hexanes to afford 19.97 g (77%) of product; [α]D25 −49.87° (98.5% e.e.). Anal. calcd. for C6H10O3: C, 55.37; H, 7.75. Found: C, 55.34; H, 7.57.
2-Cyano-6-phenyloxazolopiperidine. A 2-L, round-bottomed flask is charged with 10 g (0.073 mol) of (−)-phenylglycinol and 40 g of citric acid in 1 L of distilled water. The mixture is stirred magnetically until complete dissolution is achieved and is then cooled to 0–5°C (ice-water bath). The flask is equipped with a dropping funnel and 45 mL of an aqueous 24% glutaraldehyde solution (0.11 mol) is added dropwise over 20 min and the resultant cloudy solution is stirred for an additional 30 min at 0°C. The cooling bath is removed and a solution of 7.15 g (0.11 mol) of potassium cyanide in 20 mL of water is carefully added in one portion followed by 200 mL of methylene chloride. The resulting two-phase reaction system is stirred for 3 hr at room temperature, then the aqueous phase is neutralized by addition of sodium bicarbonate and the two layers are separated. The water layer is extracted with three 200-mL portions of methylene chloride and the combined methylene chloride layers are dried over sodium sulfate and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to a volume of 500 mL. Zinc bromide (2 g) is added in small portions over 5 min to this solution and vigorous stirring under nitrogen is continued for 3 hr. The reaction mixture is concentrated to a volume of approximately 150 mL and the resultant mixture is applied to a 10-cm diameter flash chromatography column prepared using hexane-ether (2:1) as the eluant. The desired product is eluted first,. By recrystallization from hexane, the product [10.8–11.6 g (65–70%)] is obtained analytically pure; mp 79–81°C, [α]D23 −280° (CHCl3, c 1.0).
B. Azetidine. A stirred mixture of 38 g. (0.68 mole) of potassium hydroxide pellets in 100 ml. of white mineral oil is heated to 140–150° in a four-necked, 500-ml., round-bottomed flask, fitted with an air-driven Hershberg stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a 6-in. Vigreux column fitted with a vacuum-distillation head. The flask is removed from the heat source, and 50 g. (0.32 mole) of purified ethyl 3-(1-azetidinyl)propionate is added dropwise at a rate sufficient to maintain the reaction temperature at 150°. After addition is complete, the reaction mixture is heated to 200° at 50 mm. to remove all traces of ethanol. The flask is fitted with a distillation head and a nitrogen bubbler, and the distillation is resumed at atmospheric pressure until azetidine distills (210° maximum pot temperature,). The resulting product (19.6 g., 85% purity) is dried over potassium hydroxide and redistilled through a short Vigreux column yielding 14.5–15.8 g. (80–87%) of purified azetidine, b.p. 62–63°.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer are placed 82 g. (0.62 mole) of t-butyl carbazate,2 72 g. of glacial acetic acid, and 100 ml. of water. The solution is cooled in an ice bath, and 47.0 g. (0.68 mole) of solid sodium nitrite is added over a period of 40–50 minutes, the temperature being kept at 10–15°. The mixture is allowed to stand in the ice bath for 30 minutes, 100 ml. of water is added, and the floating oil is extracted into four 40-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed twice with 50-ml. portions of water and with 40-ml. portions of 1M sodium bicarbonate solution until no longer acidic (about three washings are required). The solution is dried over magnesium sulfate, and the ether is removed by distillation from a water bath maintained at 40–45°; water aspirator pressure of 140–150 mm. is used. The pressure is then lowered to 70 mm., and the water bath temperature is raised to 90–95°. The azide is distilled (Caution!) using a Claisen flask and is collected at 73–74° (70 mm.), n24D 1.4227, after a few drops of fore-run. The yield is 57–72.8 g. (64–82%) and.
A rapid stream of chlorine gas is bubbled into the mixture at 0–15° with vigorous stirring until an increase in weight of about 95 g. has occurred (30–40 minutes). A 250-ml. portion of water at room temperature is added to the suspension, which is then filtered by suction through rather porous filter paper on a 16-cm. Büchner funnel. The filtrate is removed and cooled in an ice bath, and the filter cake is washed on the funnel with a 250-ml. portion of water at room temperature. The filtrate is poured back in the funnel and sucked through the filter cake repeatedly until no more solid appears to dissolve, and then is combined with the original filtrate.
B. 2,3-O-Isopropylidene-D-glyceraldehyde. A large, magnetic stir bar is added to the flask that contains the crude solid diacetonide from procedure A above and 700–800 mL of dichloromethane (10 mL/g of diacetonide) is added. The flask is equipped with a condenser and heating mantle, and the slurry is stirred vigorously and heated to reflux until the solids are digested to an even consistency. The mantle is removed, the slurry is allowed to cool below reflux, and Celite (10 g) is added with stirring. The contents are further cooled to room temperature and vacuum-filtered through a pad of Celite on a glass frit filter into a three-necked, 2-L vessel. The flask is rinsed with 50 mL of dichloromethane and the rinse is filtered through the funnel. The 2-L vessel is then equipped with an overhead stirrer, thermometer, and water bath, and stirring is begun at 300–350 rpm. A solution of 30–40 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (0.4 mL/g of diacetonide) is added with stirring, followed by 130–140 g of sodium metaperiodate (2.0 mol equiv), added portionwise over 2–3 min. The resulting mixture is stirred while the internal temperature is maintained below 35°C with water bath cooling. After the solution is stirred for 2 hr, 35–50 g of magnesium sulfate (0.5 g/g of diacetonide) is added and stirring is continued for 20 min. The slurry is vacuum-filtered through a glass frit filter into a 2-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask. The filter cake is removed, transferred back into the three-necked vessel, 200 mL of dichloromethane is added, and the resulting slurry is stirred for 10 min. The slurry is vacuum-filtered and the filtrate is added to the one-necked flask.
In a 5-l. flask are placed 1 kg. (7.9 moles) of crystallized (hydrated) oxalic acid, 1.66 kg. (2034 cc.) of 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, and 1.33 kg. (887 cc.) of carbon tetrachloride. The flask is then fitted with a fractionating column, 1 meter long, to which are attached a condenser and an automatic separator so arranged that the lighter liquid flows off to a receiver (Fig. 13). The heavier liquid flows through a tower of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and then returns to the reaction flask. The bottom of the tower is connected with a small separatory funnel through which any potassium carbonate solution, which flows from the solid in the tower, may be withdrawn from time to time.
The filtrate is poured into five volumes of ice water acidified with about 425 cc. of concentrated commercial hydrochloric acid. The benzohydrol separates as a white crystalline mass and is filtered by suction. The yield of crude air-dried product melting at 65° is 194–196 g. (96–97 per cent of the theoretical amount). From 200 g. of crude product in 200 cc. of hot alcohol there is obtained, after cooling in an ice-salt mixture, filtering, and drying, 140–145 g. of product melting at 68°. The benzohydrol remaining in the mother liquors may be precipitated with water.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, a reflux condenser connected to a calcium chloride tube, and a thermometer is placed 360 g. (406 ml., 5 moles) of dry tetrahydrofuran. The flask is surrounded by an ice bath, stirring is started, and 256 g. (153 ml., 1.67 moles) of phosphorus oxychloride is added rapidly. The mixture is cooled to 10–15°, and 50 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84) is added during the course of 3–10 minutes at a rate that does not cause the temperature to rise above 40°. The ice bath is then removed and the mixture is heated cautiously over a low luminous flame until an exothermic reaction becomes evident at about 88–90°. By moderate cooling or warming as may be required the temperature is maintained at 90–100° until the exothermic reaction ceases, as indicated by the increased rate of heating required to maintain the reaction temperature, and thereafter for an additional 10 minutes. Six hundred milliliters of water is added, the mixture is heated under reflux for 30 minutes and then distilled through a downward condenser until the vapor temperature reaches 99–100°.
About 750 ml. of water is added to the mixture with shaking. After 30 minutes the mixture is poured into a separatory funnel, and the reddish upper layer containing the benzene with some impurities is discarded. The lower layer is made alkaline by the addition of 5 N sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, and the crude thiazole, which separates as a black upper layer, is removed with ether, and the aqueous lower layer is extracted with five 120-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and filtered through glass wool. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residual oil is fractionated at atmospheric pressure; the fraction boiling at 140–150° is collected and redistilled. The yield of 2,4-dimethylthiazole boiling at 143–145° is 210–230 g. (41–45% based on the phosphorus pentasulfide).
A flame-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a stirring bar and a septum containing argon inlet and outlet needles. The flask is flushed with argon and then charged with (S)-valinol·HCl salt (3.6 g, 26 mmol) by temporarily removing the septum, triethylamine (15.5 mL, 112 mmol) and 86 mL of methylene chloride via syringe. A solution of crude acid chloride and 100 mL of methylene chloride is added to the flask via cannula. The resulting solution is maintained at room temperature, and, after 2 h, the solution is cooled to 0 °C using an ice/water bath. Methanesulfonyl chloride (3.6 mL, 47 mmol) is then added in one portion via syringe, and the resulting solution is allowed to warm to room temperature. After 16 h, the solution is transferred to a separatory funnel and washed with 150 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and 150 mL of brine. The organic layer is then dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residue is dissolved in a minimum volume of methylene chloride (~50 mL) and purified through a column of silica gel using 9:1 hexanes-ethyl acetate as eluent. Evaporation of solvent gives 8.2 g (13.9 mmol, 75% yield) of (η5-(S)-2-(4-methylethyl)oxazolinylcyclo-pentadienyl)(η4-tetraphenylcyclobutadiene)cobalt as a yellow solid.
C. (S)-2-(N,N-Dibenzylamino)-3-phenylpropanal . This procedure is based on the Swern oxidation3. A dry, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a dropping funnel is charged with 100 mL of dry dichloromethane under an atmosphere of argon. After cooling to −78°C, 1.52 g (12 mmol) of oxalyl chloride and 1.56 g (20 mmol) of dry dimethyl sulfoxide are added dropwise to the stirred solution. After 5 min, 3.31 g (10 mmol) of (S)-2-(N,N-dibenzylamino)-3-phenyl-1-propanol in 5 mL of dichloromethane are added with stirring. The mixture is stirred for an additional 0.5 hr at −78°C, and 4.05 g (40 mmol) of freshly distilled triethylamine is added. The mixture is then allowed to warm to room temperature over 0.5 hr, whereupon 50 mL of water is added. The phases are separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50 mL of diethyl ether or dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are washed successively with 10 mL of aqueous 1% hydrochloric acid , 10 mL of water, 10 mL of aqueous 5% sodium bicarbonate , and 10 mL of saturated aqueous NaCl . The organic layer is dried over MgSO4 , and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure, to provide 3.22 g (95-98% yield) of the aldehyde as a crude product having a purity of ≥95% and.
The reaction mixture is poured into 700 cc. of water and the flask is washed out with a portion of a previously prepared solution of 330 g. of sodium hydroxide in 1400 cc. of water, the washings being added to the reaction mixture. The remainder of the alkali is then added and the mixture agitated and cooled under the tap. At this point two distinct layers are present, a lower pink-colored alkaline water layer, and an upper strongly colored aniline layer. The water layer is, while warm, carefully separated from the purple-colored oil by means of a separatory funnel (heated to prevent the separation of sodium arsanilate) and after treatment with 15 g. of decolorizing carbon is filtered through paper.
The cold reaction mixture is poured slowly with stirring into a 3-l. beaker containing 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 300 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, and 150 g. of ice. A white precipitate starts to separate. An additional 150 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride is added to the beaker and, after a minute, an upper layer begins to appear. The contents are transferred to a 2-l. separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 15 to 30 minutes while an upper brown layer separates. The upper layer is reserved while the lower layer is extracted with several portions of benzene, totalling 900 ml. The upper layer and the benzene extracts are combined and washed with seven 1-l. portions of water containing 10 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The benzene layer is washed successively with 100-ml. portions of aqueous 2% sodium hydrogen carbonate until the washings are basic, dried over 100 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, treated with 1 g. of charcoal, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated at reduced pressure, yielding 59–62 g. (60–63%) of crude 3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde, as a tan solid, m.p. 76–80°. Trituration in an ice bath with cold dry diethyl ether (ca. 0.3 ml./g.) gives a spongy solid, m.p. 85–87° (lit.3 85°), with losses of 5–10%, sufficiently pure for most uses. Further purification may be effected by recrystallization from toluene-hexane.
B. Dibenzofuran-4,6-dicarbonyl chloride (3): A 250-mL, three-necked flask, equipped with a magnetic stirbar, condenser, thermometer, and addition funnel, is charged with 5.0 g (19.6 mmol) of diacid 2 and 68 mL of chloroform (CHCl3). At 25°C, 44 mL (600 mmol) of thionyl chloride and 1 drop of dimethylformamide (DMF) are added, followed by heating the mixture at 68°C for 3 hr. After the initial suspension turns into a yellow solution, the heating source is removed and the diacid chloride 3 precipitates as a white solid. After cooling the reaction mixture to 25°C, the solid is collected via filtration using a Buchner funnel, washed with CHCl3, and dried in a vacuum desiccator for 15 hr to give 5.12 g (90%) of 3 as a white powder.
The flask is immersed in an oil bath heated to 120° and dry steam is then passed through the reaction mixture. The first few cubic centimeters of distillate contain the excess of thiophosgene and are discarded. The isothiocyanate passes over with the water as an oil that solidifies on cooling. The steam distillation requires about four hours. The crude material is crystallized from two parts of ethyl alcohol at 50°, from which it separates as white needles melting at 44–45°. The yield is 245–275 g. (72–81 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 4,5-Methylenedioxybenzocyclobutene. The reaction mixture from Step A is simply allowed to warm to room temperature over a period of several hours, during which time a white precipitate forms. After 18 hr, 100 mL of water is slowly added and the mixture is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. As the mixture is shaken, the solid dissolves in the aqueous phase, which becomes light brown. The aqueous layer is extracted with two 75-mL portions of diethyl ether, and the combined organic layers are reduced in volume to 150 mL by rotary evaporation, washed with 75 mL of water and then 75 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated to dryness by rotary evaporation to give 5.6 g of pale-yellow solid. This crude product is transferred to a large, dry ice-cooled sublimation apparatus and sublimed over a 6-hr period at 35°C (0.07 mm), at which time a dark-brown oil remains in the bottom of the apparatus. The vacuum is released by filling the apparatus with nitrogen, and the cooled portion of the apparatus is allowed to warm to room temperature. Pure 4,5-methylenedioxybenzocyclobutene, 2 (5.1–5.2 g, 91–93%) is obtained as colorless crystals, mp 60–62°C.
The brown solid from the above operations is ground in a mortar and placed in a 500-ml. distilling flask equipped with a downward condenser and a receiver. A cold solution of 100 g. (2.5 moles) of technical sodium hydroxide in 150 ml. of water is added to the solid in the flask, and heat is applied by means of an oil bath whose temperature is slowly raised to 125° From 70 to 75 g. of distillate is collected; the head temperature ranges from about 70° to 101°. The distillate is cooled in ice and saturated with technical potassium hydroxide; the organic layer that forms is separated and dried over potassium hydroxide pellets in a refrigerator for about 15 hours.
The solution is cooled to 20°, and 250 g. of ice is added. The mixture is stirred for a few minutes, then is filtered with suction (hardened filter paper), and the solid is washed with 35 ml. of ice water. The solid is suspended in 25 ml. of water in a 600-ml. beaker and is slowly dissolved by gradual addition of 55–65 ml. of a 10% solution of sodium carbonate. The solution is filtered, and the filtrate is made strongly acidic to Congo red by addition of 1:1 hydrochloric acid. The mixture is chilled in ice for an hour and is then filtered. The product is washed with 12 ml. of ice water and air-dried. The acid melts at 174–176° and weighs 14–17 g. (55–66%). The acid may be recrystallized by dissolving 10 g. of it in 250 ml. of boiling 5% hydrochloric acid. The solution, when chilled in ice, deposits 9.4 g. of 2,5-dinitrobenzoic acid as nearly colorless crystals which melt at 177–178°.
B. o-Nitrobenzaldehyde. A suspension of 51.6 g. of the diacetate in a mixture of 500 g. (272 ml.) of concentrated hydrochloric acid, 450 ml. of water, and 80 ml. of ethanol is stirred and refluxed for 45 minutes. The mixture is then cooled to 0°, and the solid is filtered with suction and washed with water and. The crude product is purified by rapid steam distillation through a 100-cm. Allihn condenser into a cooled receiver. About 3.5 l. of distillate is collected during 30 minutes; the cooled distillate is filtered, and the o-nitrobenzaldehyde is dried in a desiccator over calcium chloride. It weighs 23.7 g. (74%) and melts at 44–45°.
(A) In a 500-cc. Claisen distilling flask with a low side tube connected to a condenser, are placed 105 g. (0.69 mole) of mandelic acid (p. 336) (m.p. 118°) and 151 g. (137 cc., 1.92 moles) of acetyl chloride. A reaction sets in without the application of heat. As soon as a clear solution results, the flask is warmed on a water bath and the excess acetyl chloride is distilled. The last trace of acetyl chloride may be removed by prolonged drying in a vacuum. The acetylmandelic acid then crystallizes in large, round, white clusters after one or two days' standing. The yield is 130–133 g. (97–99 per cent of the theoretical amount).
Ethyl 2-butyrylacetate. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dry nitrogen inlet, and thermometer is placed 19.8 g (0.150 mol) of monoethyl malonate, 350 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF,), and 5 mg of 2,2'-bipyridyl. The solution is cooled to approximately −70°C (in an isopropyl alcohol-dry ice bath) and a 1.6 M solution of butyllithium in hexane is added from a dropping funnel while the temperature is allowed to rise to approximately −10°C. Sufficient butyllithium is added (approx. 190 mL) until a pink color persists for several minutes. The heterogeneous solution is recooled to −65°C and 7.90 mL (7.98 g, 75 mmol) of isobutyryl chloride is added dropwise over 5 min. The reaction solution is stirred for another 5 min and then poured into a separatory funnel containing 500 mL of ether and 300 mL of cold, 1 N hydrochloric acid. The funnel is shaken, the layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed with two 150-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, followed by 150 mL of water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. Removal of the solvents under reduced pressure leaves 11.70 g (98%) of ethyl 2-butyrylacetate. The crude product can be distilled at 70–74°C (7 mm) (80% yield, 96% purity by GLC).
In a 2-l. Erlenmeyer flask fitted with a reflux condenser and arranged for magnetic stirring are placed 400 ml. of absolute ethanol and 11.5 g. (0.5 g. atom) of sodium added in small portions. After the sodium has reacted, the clear solution is cooled to room temperature, and 42.0 g. (0.5 mole) of finely powdered cyanoacetamide is added with stirring over a period of 1 minute. Immediately thereafter 107.6 g. (0.5 mole) of ethyl (1-phenylethylidene)cyanoacetate (p. 463) is added. After about 20 minutes, the mixture becomes homogeneous and is allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours. Water (650 ml.) is added, followed by 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid in 1 portion. The resulting suspension is stirred thoroughly with a glass rod and placed in a refrigerator overnight. The product is then filtered by suction. The filter cake is sucked as dry as possible using a rubber dam, stirred to a paste with a mixture of 150 ml. of water and 50 ml. of 95% ethanol, and sucked dry. This process is repeated using 200 ml. of water, and the product is dried to constant weight in an oven at 45°. The yield is 114–116 g. (90–92%) of the dicyanoglutarimide, m.p. 274–278° (dec.).
In a 1-l. beaker are placed 50 g. (0.23 mole) of crude 9-chloroacridine and 250 g. (2.7 moles) of phenol. The mixture is stirred mechanically while it is heated to 70° (internal temperature) in an oil bath. Stirring is continued, and 30 g. (0.38 mole) of powdered ammonium carbonate is added as rapidly as the vigorous effervescence permits. The internal temperature is quickly raised to 120° and maintained there while the mixture is stirred for 45 minutes. The mixture is cooled to 30° and poured into 600 ml. of acetone in a beaker surrounded by ice. After about an hour, precipitation of 9-aminoacridine hydrochloride is complete and the product is filtered and washed free from phenol with 250 ml. of acetone. The cake is extracted by boiling it with water three times, using successively 800, 200, and 100 ml., the last portion containing 2 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The hot solutions are filtered to remove the small amount of carbonaceous matter, and the filtrates are combined. Any precipitate is redissolved by heating, and then a solution of 60 g. of sodium hydroxide in 300 ml. of water is added. The mixture is cooled and filtered; the solid is washed with 300 ml. of cold water and dried at 120°. The yield is 34–38 g. (76–85% based on phenylanthranilic acid or acridone) of bright yellow powder, m.p. 230°. This product is pure enough for most purposes, but the crude material may be purified by boiling 38 g. of it with 1.2 l. of acetone. The mixture is filtered by suction, and the filtrate is chilled in an ice-salt bath. The first crop weighs 26–27 g., and concentration of the mother liquor to 500 ml. yields an additional 6–7 g. of crystals. Both crops melt at 232–233°, and the recovery is 32–34 g. (84–89%).
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube, is placed 67 g. (0.5 mole) of powdered anhydrous aluminum chloride. The flask is cooled in an ice bath, 500 ml. of dry ether is slowly added from the dropping funnel, and the mixture is stirred for a few minutes. Meanwhile 5.5 g. of powdered lithium aluminum hydride is placed in a 1-l. flask fitted with a condenser, and 140 ml. of dry ether is added slowly from the top of the condenser with caution while the flask is kept cooled in ice. The mixture is gently refluxed for 30 minutes to effect, as far as possible, solution of the hydride. It is then cooled, and the resulting slurry (which consists of a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride in its solution) is transferred to the dropping funnel of the previous setup and is added to the ethereal solution of aluminum chloride with stirring within 10 minutes. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes without cooling to complete the formation of the "mixed hydride."
A mixture of 70 g. (0.36 mole) of pure 1,4-aminonaphthol hydrochloride and 2100 cc. of water at 30° in a 5-l. flask is stirred for a few minutes in order to dissolve most of the material and then treated with 100 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid. The mixture is heated to the boiling point until all the precipitated amine sulfate has been brought into solution. The solution is somewhat pink. The hot solution is poured rapidly through a large funnel (without a paper), which has been warmed on the steam bath, into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing a filtered solution at room temperature of 70 g. (2.4 moles) of potassium dichromate in 1 l. of water. The flask is shaken to mix the contents thoroughly. The quinone separates at once as a mass of fine, yellow needles. After cooling to 25° the material is collected, washed with water, and dried at 30–40°. The crude product is dull yellow; it melts at 124–125° to a dark liquid and weighs 53–55 g..
B. 2-Hydroxythiophene. The 2-t-butoxythiophene obtained in Step A is placed in a distillation flask equipped with a short Vigreux column and a capillary inlet for nitrogen, and 0.1 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid is added. The apparatus is placed in an oil bath at 155°. Decomposition begins immediately. After 5–10 minutes the oil bath is removed, and the distillation assembly is connected to a water pump. 2-Hydroxythiophene is distilled under reduced pressure, nitrogen gas being drawn through the capillary during the whole procedure. 2-Hydroxythiophene is collected at 91–93°/13 mm.; yield 20–23 g. (89–94%); nD20 1.5613.
B. 2,2,7,7,12,12,17,17-Octamethyl-21,22,23,24-tetraoxaperhydroquaterene. A 400-ml., stainless-steel, shaking autoclave is charged with 4.0 g. (0.0092 mole) of the tetraoxaquaterene from Part A, 200 ml. of ethanol, and 400 mg. of 5% palladium on charcoal. The autoclave is filled with hydrogen at an initial pressure of 170 atm. and heated with shaking for 4 hours at 105°. The catalyst and a white solid are removed by filtration, the solid is dissolved in 100 ml. of warm chloroform, the solution is filtered, the chloroform is evaporated, and the white solid obtained is dried under reduced pressure at 60°, leaving the tetraoxaperhydroquaterene as a white solid, m.p. 204–209°, in a yield of 2.85–2.97 g. (69–72%).
In a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and thermometer are placed 38.3 g. (0.30 mole) of p-chloroaniline, 41 ml. (0.6 mole) of concentrated aqueous ammonia (sp. gr. 0.9), and 21 ml. (0.35 mole) of carbon disulfide. The mixture is stirred vigorously, and when it is heated to 30° the reaction starts. The temperature is maintained at 30–35° by external cooling. The reaction mixture turns into a deep-red turbid solution within a few minutes, and then suddenly a heavy yellow precipitate of ammonium p-chlorophenyldithiocarbamate separates. To the mixture 15 ml. of water is added, and stirring is continued for 1 hour. The mixture is filtered with suction, and the residue is washed with two 30-ml. portions of a 3% aqueous solution of ammonium chloride and with two 15-ml. portions of 96% ethanol.
The collected solution (pink) is concentrated by distillation, under reduced pressure, to a volume of about 100 ml., and the resulting orange-colored solution is decolorized with Norit. After the addition of 300 ml. of absolute ethanol and 500 ml. of ether, followed by vigorous shaking, a white solid forms within a few minutes. The ε-aminocaproic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel and dried in a vacuum desiccator until no more ether-alcohol odor is detected. A yield of 52 g. (90%) is obtained; m.p. 202–203°.
A solution of 100 g. of c.p. concentrated sulfuric acid in 700 cc. of water is prepared in a 5-l. flask, 1.5 l. of cracked ice added, and the mixture shaken until ice forms on the outside of the flask. After about half of this solution has been poured into the cold ether solution of the imino ether, using a funnel to remove the excess ice, the mixture is shaken for exactly fifteen seconds, allowed to settle, and the layers separated. The remaining acid is added to the ether layer in two portions, the mixture each time being shaken for fifteen seconds, and separated. Since the ether solution, although now free of the imino ether, still contains a small amount of ethyl phenylacetoacetate, it is saved to be combined with the main portion later.
(A) Symmetrical o-Phthalyl Chloride.—A mixture of 148 g. (1 mole) of phthalic anhydride and 220 g. (1.06 moles) of phosphorus pentachloride is placed in a 500-cc. Claisen flask. The flask is equipped with a reflux condenser, the upper end of which is provided with a calcium chloride tube, and the side arm of the flask is closed with a cork. The flask is inclined slightly so that any phosphorus oxychloride which collects in the stoppered side arm will run back into the flask. After heating in an oil bath at 150° for twelve hours, the air condenser and the stopper in the end of the side arm are removed, and the flask is connected to a water-cooled condenser. The temperature is then raised gradually to 250°, during which time most of the phosphorus oxychloride distils into a receiver. The liquid residue is distilled under reduced pressure; at first a small quantity of phosphorus oxychloride distils, and then the sym. o-phthalyl chloride distils at 131–133°/9–10 mm. The product thus obtained contains a small amount of phthalic anhydride; it solidifies on cooling in an ice-salt mixture and melts at 11–12°. The yield is 187 g. (92 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The benzene solution is separated and washed twice with 100 cc. of water, once with 200 cc. of 5 per cent potassium hydroxide, and twice with water. If the solution is not colorless it is clarified with 1 g. of Norite. The benzene is removed by distillation, and the resulting syrup is dissolved in 300 cc. of alcohol by heating. The solution on cooling deposits cholestanone as well-formed needles. The yield of collected, washed, and air-dried material, m.p. 129–130°, is 41.5–42 g. (83–84 per cent of the theoretical amount). The addition of 80 cc. of water to the filtrate gives about 2 g. of material melting at 125–126°.
A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser with Dean-Stark trap, nitrogen bubbler and a thermometer, is charged with toluene (200 mL), (1R,2S)-(−)-norephedrine (37.8 g, 0.25 mol), 1,4-dibromobutane (59.38 g, 0.275 mol) and sodium bicarbonate (46.2 g, 0.55 mol). The stirred heterogeneous reaction mixture is heated to reflux (105-118°C,) under a nitrogen atmosphere until completion of the reaction. At the end of the reaction approximately 9 mL of water has collected in the Dean-Stark trap.
A. (1S,2S)-N-(2-Hydroxy-1-methyl-2-phenylethyl)-N-methylpropionamide, ((1S,2S)-pseudoephedrinepropionamide). A flame-dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is charged with 21.3 g (129 mmol) of (1S,2S)-(+)-pseudoephedrine and 250 mL of tetrahydrofuran. The flask is placed in a water bath at 23°C, and to the well-stirred solution, 18.0 g (138 mmol) of propionic anhydride is added by a Pasteur pipette in 1-mL portions over approximately 5 min. The flask is sealed with a rubber septum containing a needle adapter to an argon-filled balloon, and the clear, colorless solution is allowed to stir at 23°C for an additional 10 min. The rubber septum is removed, and the reaction solution is neutralized by the addition of 400 mL of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution. After thorough mixing, the biphasic mixture is poured into a separatory funnel and extracted with three portions of ethyl acetate (250 mL, 150 mL, and 150 mL, respectively). The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate , filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a white solid. Residual solvent is removed under vacuum (0.5 mm) for 3 hr. The solid residue is dissolved in 125 mL of hot (110°C) toluene in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and the flask is placed in a water bath at 80°C. This bath is allowed to cool slowly to 23°C. Extensive crystallization occurs as the solution cools. Crystallization is completed by cooling the flask to −20°C. After 10 hr, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 100 mL of cold (0°C) toluene . The crystals are dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 3 hr to afford 27.2 g (95%) of the (1S,2S)-pseudoephedrinepropionamide as a white solid.
A mixture of 50 g. (0.3 mole) of dl-glyceraldehyde acetal (p. 307) and 500 cc. of 0.1 N sulfuric acid is allowed to stand for one week at about 20°. Thirty cubic centimeters of glacial acetic acid is added; the mixture is neutralized carefully with barium hydroxide solution, stirred with 5 g. of decolorizing carbon, and filtered. The filtrate is evaporated at 10 mm. pressure. When no more water can be removed, the residue is treated with an equal volume of absolute alcohol to hasten crystallization. The crystals are collected on a filter and dried in a vacuum desiccator over soda-lime and calcium chloride. The yield of product melting at 137–139° is 22 g. (80 per cent of the theoretical amount).
After the sodium cyanide solution is added, the bottle is stoppered securely, placed in a mechanical shaker, and shaken for four hours at room temperature. At the end of this time the solution is transferred to a 3-l. distilling flask and 600 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added (Hood).
The benzene solution, without drying, is transferred in portions of about 500 cc. to a 1-l. Claisen flask connected to a water-cooled condenser. The flask is heated on the steam bath until the benzene no longer distils. The steam bath is then replaced by an oil bath and the system is gradually evacuated to a pressure of 10–12 mm. while the oil bath is held at about 90°. When all the benzene, unchanged ester, and ketone have distilled the temperature of the oil bath is increased. When the temperature of the distillate reaches 105°/10–12 mm. the receiver is changed. The bath temperature is immediately raised to 175° and all material distilling between 105° and 165° at 10–15 mm. is collected. This requires one-half to one hour. During this time the bath temperature is slowly increased to 200° to obtain the last portions. The yield is 250–265 g. (63–67 per cent of the theoretical amount). The distillate is transferred to a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask, and a trace of iron powder and some finely ground soft glass are added. The mixture is distilled at 40 mm. with the bath temperature maintained at 165–175°. Carbon monoxide is evolved and the distillate is collected between 125° and 140°. About one and a half to two hours is required for the pyrolysis. The yield of ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate is 200–210 g. (59–62 per cent of the theoretical amount based on cyclohexanone). This product, whose refractive index at 25° varies from 1.476 to 1.479, is sufficiently pure for use in the next step without redistillation.
An intimate mixture of 166 g. (1.2 moles) of anhydrous potassium carbonate and 294 g. (2 moles) of phthalimide is treated with 506 g. (4 moles) of benzyl chloride, and the mixture is heated in an oil bath at 190° under a reflux condenser for three hours. While the mixture is still hot, the excess benzyl chloride is removed by steam distillation. Near the end of this operation the benzyl phthalimide crystallizes. It is advisable to cool the mixture rapidly with very vigorous agitation so that the material is in as fine a state of division as possible. The solid is filtered on a large Büchner funnel, thoroughly washed with water, and drained as completely as possible by suction. It is then washed once with 400 cc. of 60 per cent alcohol and drained again. The yield of this product, melting at 100–110°, is 340–375 g. (72–79 per cent of the theoretical amount). It is conveniently purified by crystallizing from glacial acetic acid. The recovery in the crystallization is about 80 per cent, and the pure product melts at 116° (corr.).
An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, a 250-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel and an argon inlet is charged with 1500 mL of dry toluene, 145 mL (2.0 mol) of freshly distilled furan and 39.4 g (0.1 mol) of 1,2,4,5-tetrabromobenzene,. In an argon atmosphere, the solution is cooled to −23°C (dry ice, CCl4) and 131 mL (2.1 equiv) of 1.6 M butyllithium in hexanes is added dropwise over 1 hr. After addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (1-2 hr) and is stirred at this temperature for 3 hr. The reaction is quenched by dropwise addition of 10 mL of methanol .
To a 1-l. separatory funnel is added ca. 500 ml. of 20% aqueous silver nitrate solution (100 g. of Mallinckrodt C.P. crystals to ca. 500 ml. of water). The pentane solution is added to the separatory funnel in five approximately equal portions, with intermittent shaking until all the silver nitrate complex has gone into solution.
A 2-l. two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer is fitted with a 250-ml. pressure-equalizing constant-rate dropping funnel and a condenser, the top of which is connected to a mercury trap to prevent the entrance of air during the reaction and for the detection of gas evolution. The dropping funnel is removed, and 35 g. (0.85 mole) of sodium hydride dispersed in mineral oil is added. The mineral oil is removed by washing the dispersion four times with 100-ml. portions of benzene. The benzene is removed with a pipet after the sodium hydride is allowed to settle.
The residue is transferred to a 250-cc. Claisen flask; two small portions of benzene (5–10 cc.) are used to rinse the last drops of the residue into the flask. The last traces of benzene are removed by warming gently under reduced pressure, and the 5-methylfurfural is then collected at 83–85°/15 mm.. The yield is 63–70 g. (20–22 per cent of the theoretical amount, based upon the levulose portion of the sugar).
The combined filtrate and washings from the piperazine dihydrochloride are cooled in an ice bath and treated with 25 ml. of absolute ethanol saturated at 0° with dry hydrogen chloride. After the solution has been well mixed, it is cooled for 10–15 minutes in an ice bath. The precipitated white plates of 1-benzylpiperazine dihydrochloride are collected by suction filtration, washed with dry benzene, and dried. The product, which melts at about 280° with decomposition, after sintering at about 254°, amounts to 29.0–29.5 g. (93–95%). A solution of this salt in 50 ml. of water is made alkaline (pH > 12) with about 60 ml. of 5N sodium hydroxide, then extracted twelve times with 20-ml. portions of chloroform. The combined extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the pale-brown oil remaining after removal of solvent is distilled at reduced pressure in a Claisen flask. The yield of pure 1-benzylpiperazine, b.p. 122–124°/2.5 mm., nD25 1.5440–1.5450, is 14.3–16.5 g. (65–75%).
The reaction mixture is hydrolyzed by pouring it, with frequent shaking, into a 5-l. round-bottomed flask containing 1.5 kg. of cracked ice and a solution of 300 g. of ammonium chloride in 600 cc. of water. The ether layer is separated in a large separatory funnel, and the aqueous residue is extracted with two 500-cc. portions of ether.
A. Rhodium II tetrakis(triphenylacetate) dimer (2). To a 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a short-path distillation apparatus and a 100-mL receiving bulb is added rhodium (II) acetate dimer (1.26 g, 2.85 mmol), triphenylacetic acid (1) (6.55 g, 22.7 mmol, 8.0 equiv) and chlorobenzene (120 mL). The mixture is heated with an oil bath that is set to a temperature at which the solvent distills at a rate of 10 mL/hour (approximately 155 °C). The green mixture becomes homogeneous upon heating. After 7 h, the reaction is cooled to 25 °C and the residual solvent is concentrated at 65 °C by rotary evaporation (20-25 mmHg) and then at 0.5 mmHg. The solid residue is dissolved in 200 mL of dichloromethane. The solution is washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (3 × 200 mL), saturated aqueous sodium chloride (100 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate (15 g), filtered and concentrated at 40 °C by rotary evaporation (225 mmHg) and then at 0.5 mmHg. To the green solid, methanol (40 mL) is added and the residue is stirred in a 35 °C water bath. After 5 minutes, dichloromethane is added portion wise with stirring and heating in a 35 °C water bath until the solid is completely dissolved (approximately 200 mL of DCM). The solution is left to rest at -19 °C for 72 h. The crystals are collected by suction filtration on a fritted glass funnel and dried at 0.5 mmHg to afford 3.01 g (78% yield) of the desired product.
A. Acenaphthenol acetate. In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask are placed 154 g. (1 mole) of acenaphthene and 1.1 l. of glacial acetic acid. The flask is fitted with a tantalum or Nichrome wire stirrer1 and a thermometer extending below the surface of the liquid. The solution is stirred and heated to 60°, at which point the source of heat is removed and 820 g. of red lead is added in portions of about 50 g., each portion being added as soon as the color due to the previous portion has been discharged. During this operation, which requires 30–40 minutes, the temperature is maintained at 60–70 by external cooling. The reaction is complete when a portion of the solution gives no test for lead tetraacetate. The dark red syrupy solution (which may contain a few suspended particles of red lead and lead dioxide) is poured into 2 l. of water contained in a 4-l. separatory funnel. The acetate is extracted with a 350-ml. portion of ether and then with a 250-ml. portion. The total extract is washed first with 100 ml. of water, then with 300 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution and is finally dried over 50 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The sodium sulfate is removed by filtration and washed colorless with three 50-ml. portions of dry ether. The combined filtrate and washings are placed in a 500-ml. Claisen flask with an inset side arm, and, after distillation of the solvent, the acetate is distilled under reduced pressure. The acetate distils almost entirely at 166–168°/5 mm. (bath temperature 180–185°, raised to 220° at the end) as a mobile yellow oil. The yield is 170–175 g. (80–82%).
A solution of 63.8 g. (0.75 mole) of cyanoacetic acid in 750 ml. of cold water is placed in a 2-l. beaker. N-Bromosuccinimide (267 g., 1.5 moles) is added in portions with good mechanical stirring over a period of about 6 minutes. The slightly exothermic reaction which attends the separation of the dibromoacetonitrile as a heavy oil is completed in about 20 minutes, after which time the beaker is placed in an ice bath and allowed to cool for 2 hours.
(A) Potassium Phthalimide.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux condenser are placed 80 g. (0.54 mole) of phthalimide and 1600 cc. of absolute alcohol (p. 249). The mixture is gently boiled for about fifteen minutes or until no more of the phthalimide dissolves. The hot solution is decanted from any solid into a specially prepared solution of 30.5 g. (0.54 mole) of potassium hydroxide. A precipitate of potassium phthalimide separates at once. The mixture is stirred and cooled quickly to room temperature, and the precipitate is filtered with suction. To the alcoholic mother liquors a second 80-g. portion of phthalimide is added, and the entire process is repeated. The two crops of crystals are united and washed with 200 cc. of acetone to remove any unchanged phthalimide. The yield of air-dried potassium phthalimide is 160–180 g. (80–90 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In order to prepare pure acetoxime, the procedure is modified in the following way: After neutralizing the solution of acetoxime formed after the addition of acetone, the oily layer is separated and the aqueous solution shaken with two or three 150-cc. portions of benzene. The oil and benzene solutions are mixed, the water thereby thrown out is removed, and the oil fractionally distilled with the use of a column, the portion boiling 133–136° being collected as pure acetoxime. This product, which weighs 420–480 g. (67–76 per cent of the theoretical amount), solidifies in the receiver to colorless needles melting at 60–61°. The foreruns and aqueous liquors are best distilled with steam and the distillate converted into hydroxylamine hydrochloride as above, whereupon 75–90 g. of pure salt is obtained.
A mixture of 112 g. (1.00 mole) of acetone azine and 32 g. (1.0 mole) of anhydrous hydrazine is placed in a 300-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a reflux air condenser and drying tube, and kept at 100° for 12–16 hours. (Caution! This reaction and the subsequent distillation should be carried out behind a protective screen.) The crude product is then distilled rapidly through a water-cooled condenser, and the colorless fraction boiling at 122–126° is collected, nD22 1.4607, yielding 111–127 g. (77–88%, and) of essentially pure acetone hydrazone.
In a 3-l., three-necked flask equipped with a stirrer, thermometer, drying tube filled with Drierite, and a dropping funnel are placed 500 ml. of methanol, 500 ml. of benzene, 380 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate, and 155 ml. (2.15 moles) of distilled furan. The slurry is cooled to < −5° with a dry ice-acetone bath (maintained at −10 to −15° during the addition), and an ice-cold solution of 106 ml. (2.0 moles) of bromine in 1.0 l. of methanol is added dropwise or at such a rate as to maintain a reaction temperature of 0 to −5°. This requires about one hour; the mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours at < 0° and filtered. The solids collected are washed in the funnel with two 100-ml. portions of benzene. The filtrate is stirred for 30 minutes with 100 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate and refiltered. The solvent is removed at reduced pressure to a volume of about 300 ml. Filtration and washing with benzene is repeated, the filtrate is stirred for 15–20 minutes with anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and distilled through a short packed column to give 195–205 g. (75–79%) of a clear oil, b.p. 80–82° (50 mm.), n25D 1.4333 and.
A Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar is placed atop the residue, which is dissolved in 140 mL of dichloromethane. The stirred solution is cooled in an ice–water bath to 0°C as 60 mL of 15% hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise via an addition funnel over 30 min. Vigorous stirring is maintained at this temperature for 1.5 hr. The mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, diluted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate and washed twice with 150-mL portions of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and freed of solvent under reduced pressure. The residual yellowish solid is dissolved in a small amount of dichloromethane and eluted with 5% ethyl acetate in dichloromethane through a column of 80 g of neutral alumina (activity III) to afford 8.28–9.19 g (79–87%) of colorless crystals, mp 65–66°C. 1H NMR analysis shows this material to be of very high purity.
A. Diethyl α-acetyl-β-ketopimelate. In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a mercury-sealed Hershberg stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser protected with a calcium chloride tube are placed 11.5 g. (0.5 g. atom) of finely powdered sodium and 500 ml. of dry ether. The flask is placed in an ice bath, and 65.0 g. (63.5 ml., 0.5 mole) of freshly distilled ethyl acetoacetate in 150 ml. of dry ether is slowly added from the dropping funnel with stirring (approximate time for addition is 30–40 minutes). The mixture is stirred overnight, then it is cooled in an ice bath, and 89.0 g. (0.5 mole) of γ-carbethoxybutyryl chloride in 200 ml. of dry ether is added gradually over the course of 1 hour. The reaction is first stirred overnight at room temperature, then gently refluxed by heating in a water bath for 30 minutes. The mixture is cooled in an ice bath, and a cold solution of 20 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid in 300 ml. of water is added cautiously with vigorous stirring. The stirring is continued until two clear layers form when the stirring is stopped. The ethereal layer is separated and the aqueous layer extracted once with 100 ml. of ether. The two organic layers are combined, washed once with water, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. After removal of the sodium sulfate by filtration, the solvent is removed by heating the ethereal solution on a water bath held at about 50–60°. The residual light-brown liquid is transferred to a 150 ml. Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The fraction boiling at 142–147°/0.4 mm. or 158–162°/2.5 mm. is collected. The yield is 84–91 g. (61–66%), nD28 1.4649–1.4655.
E. 2,3-Dihydroxypropyl (Z)-tetradec-7-enoate (7). A 250-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a oval-shaped magnetic stir bar (4 cm x 1.5 cm) is charged with acetonide 6 (4.80 g, 14.1 mmol), methanol (60 mL), and 2.0 M hydrochloric acid (4.0 mL). The flask is sealed with a rubber septum and the reaction mixture is allowed to stir for 6 h. After this time, the reaction mixture is poured into a 1-L separatory funnel containing a mixture of ether (350 mL) and saturated sodium bicarbonate (350 mL). The funnel is swirled gently to release carbon dioxide. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with ether (3 x 150 mL). The combined organic phases are dried over magnesium sulfate (20 g), which is removed by vacuum filtration through a Büchner funnel (150 mmHg). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation at (< 30 &Degree;C, 20 mmHg) to give an orange oil that is purified by flash chromatography on silica gel to give 3.02 g (71%) of monoacylglycerol 7 as an orange oil. This sample is a 20:1 mixture of 1-monoacylglycerol (1-MAG) 7 and the corresponding 2-MAG, respectively,, and). If desired, the sample can be enriched further in the desired 1-MAG by recrystallization.
In a 3- or 5-gallon stoneware crock are placed 950 cc. (1130 g., 11.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19), 950 cc. of water, 200 g. (196 cc., 2.15 moles) of aniline, and 2 kg. of ice. The mixture is agitated by a mechanical stirrer, and, as soon as the temperature drops below 5°, a chilled solution of 156 g. (2.26 moles) of sodium nitrite in a measured volume (700–1000 cc.) of water is introduced fairly rapidly from a separatory funnel, the stem of which projects below the surface of the reaction mixture. The addition should not be fast enough to cause the temperature to rise to 10° or to cause evolution of oxides of nitrogen. The last 5 per cent of the nitrite solution is added more slowly, and the reaction mixture is tested with starch-iodide paper at intervals until an excess of nitrous acid is indicated.
Optically pure sulfoxide is then easily isolated as follows. The crude product (10 g) is diluted with 4 mL of a solvent mixture (ethyl acetate/cyclohexane = 9 : 1). This solution is poured onto a column (75-mm diameter) filled with 120 g of silica gel (Merck 230–400 mesh) for flash chromatography. Elution is performed under gravity and requires ca. 200 mL of the above solvent system, followed by ca. 200 mL of ethyl acetate. 2-Phenyl-2-propanol mixed with methyl p-tolyl sulfide is eluted in the first fraction (ca. 150 mL, monitored by TLC). The subsequent fractions are collected (ca. 300 mL) and evaporated, giving 4.0 g of methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide [α]D −88° (acetone, c 1), 89% ee, 85% yield. This material is crystallized once from 60 mL of hot hexane, to afford, after 2 hr at 20°C, 3.14 g (68%) of enantiomerically pure (S)-(−)-methyl p-tolyl sulfoxide as needles, [α]D −142° (acetone, c 1), mp 73–76°C (Reichert microscope with heating system).
To a 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is added 7.2 g. (0.15 mole) of a 50% dispersion of sodium hydride in mineral oil. The sodium hydride is washed several times by decantation with dry ether and is then covered with 300 ml. of dry benzene. The flask is equipped with dropping funnel, stirrer, and reflux condenser. Diethyl ethylmalonate (28.2 g., 0.15 mole) is added dropwise over a 5-minute period, and the reaction mixture is stirred for 2 hours until a clear solution forms. The solution is cooled in an ice bath, and 24.2 g. (0.1 mole) of benzoyl peroxide in 300 ml. of dry benzene is added dropwise over a 1-hour period with continuous stirring. After another 30 minutes, a peroxide test is made to ensure that all the peroxide has reacted.
A. Lanthanum-lithium-(R)-BINOL complex (LLB) . A dry, 300-mL, three-necked flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, septum cap, and a rubber balloon filled with argon, is charged with (R)-2,2'-dihydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl ((R)-BINOL; 6.49 g, 22.7 mmol , Note 1) and 119 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF, Note 2) under an argon atmosphere. The system is placed in an ice-water bath and magnetic stirring is initiated. Via syringe, 28.4 mL (45.4 mmol) of a 1.60 M hexane solution of butyllithium is added to the cooled (R)-BINOL solution over 7 min and the pale yellow mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min. The cooling bath is removed and the THF solution of (R)-BINOL dilithium salt is allowed to reach room temperature.
The combined pinacolone fraction is dried over calcium chloride, filtered, and fractionally distilled. There is first a small low-boiling portion; then the pinacolone comes over at 103–107°; and finally there is a higher-boiling portion which yields more pinacolone on redistillation. The yield from a run, as described, is 287–318 g. (65–72 per cent of the theoretical amount). This product occasionally turns slightly yellow on standing, but redistillation removes the color with almost no loss of product.
This product is suitable for most synthetic purposes. An almost colorless product may be obtained by recrystallization from boiling acetonitrile (100 ml. dissolves 1.8 g. of product) with treatment with activated carbon. The recovery of aminomalononitrile p-toluenesulfonate, m.p. 172° (dec.), is ca. 80%.
The flask is placed in an ice bath, and 25 per cent sulfuric acid is added slowly, with stirring, until no further reaction takes place and all the excess magnesium has dissolved. The oily layer is separated, and the water layer is extracted with two 100-cc. portions of ether. The combined ether-benzene extracts are shaken with three 100-cc. portions of 25 per cent sodium hydroxide. Each alkaline layer is extracted successively with a 100-cc. portion of ether, and the combined alkaline extracts are then heated to 100° to drive off volatile impurities.
A. 2-(4'-Methylphenyl)-pyridine N-oxide. A 1-L, three-necked round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stir bar (cylindrical, 4 × 1 cm), two glass stoppers and a reflux condenser with a gas bubbler on the top and connection to the argon line. Pd(OAc)2 (0.560 g, 2.50 mmol, 5 mol%), PtBu3.HBF4 (0.870 g, 3.00 mmol, 6 mol%), potassium carbonate powder (K2CO3, 8.97 g, 65.0 mmol, 1.3 equiv), and pyridine N-oxide (19.0 g, 200 mmol, 4 equiv) are weighed in air and placed inside the flask. The whole setup is then evacuated (0.4 mmHg) and refilled with argon four times.
A. N,N-Diethyl-2-methoxybenzamide (2). An oven-dried, two-necked, 500-mL flask equipped with a septum cap, nitrogen bubbler, and magnetic stirrer is charged with 2-methoxybenzoic acid (20 g, 0.13 mol) under nitrogen. Thionyl chloride (135 mL, 220 g, 1.85 mol) is added with stirring, resulting in slow effervescence. Dimethylformamide (DMF, 0.34 mL, 320 mg, 4.4 mmol),(Note 4) is added dropwise via syringe after which effervescence becomes much more vigorous (CAUTION: Sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride are evolved). The solution is stirred for 0.5 hr, at which time no further effervescence is visible. Half of the thionyl chloride is removed under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator, toluene (100 mL) is added, and the mixture is evaporated to dryness. A further 100 mL of toluene is added and the process of evaporation is repeated twice more to ensure complete removal of all excess thionyl chloride. The colorless oil is dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 150 mL), the resulting solution is cooled in an ice water bath, and treated slowly with diethylamine (50 mL, 35.3 g, 0.48 mol), with stirring to prevent the reaction from becoming too vigorous. A copious white precipitate forms.
The pure sulfoxide fractions, Samples 2.2 and 3, are combined in a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in a mixture of hot EtOAc and heptane (20:80, 75 mL, Notes 22 and 23). Recrystallization occurs as the solution sits at room temperature (12 h, 25 °C), allowing for partial solvent evaporation (5 mL). Filtration on a Büchner funnel gives the sulfoxide, which is dried under vacuum (0.02 mmHg) to afford off-white needles (8.07 g, 61%, Sample 4). Further purification is performed by sublimation of the solid at a pressure of 0.02 mmHg over a period of 4 h in a standard sublimation apparatus, with a water-cooled cold finger and with the external oil bath at 90 °C, which gives (S)-(-)-p-bromophenyl methyl sulfoxide as a white powder (8.07 g, 99 % ee, 61% yield).
A. (S)-Proline-N-carboxyanhydride. A dry, 3-L, three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, nitrogen inlet tube, 500-mL, pressure-equalized addition funnel and a Teflon-coated thermocouple probe, containing dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) (600 mL) is charged with (S)-proline (60.0 g, 0.521 mol). To the cooled (15–20°C) suspension is added phosgene (324 mL, 0.625 mol, 1.93 M in toluene), via a pressure-equalized addition funnel, over a 0.5–1.0 hr period maintaining a temperature of 15–20°C. The reaction mixture is then aged for 0.5–0.75 hr at 30–40°C. The reaction mixture should become homogeneous as the proline reacts with the phosgene to afford the intermediate N-carbamoyl chloride. Once homogeneous, the reaction mixture is aged an additional 0.5 hr, then concentrated under reduced pressure (15–20°C, 1000 down to 50 mBar) to a volume of 80 mL. Dry tetrahydrofuran (600 mL, KF < 50 μg/mL) is added to the mixture and it is cooled to 0–5°C. Dry triethylamine (72.6 mL, 0.521 mol, KF < 50 μg/mL) is added over 0.25 hr. The mixture is aged for 0.5 hr at 0–5°C, then filtered through an enclosed, 2-L, medium-frit Schlenk funnel under an atmosphere of nitrogen (with careful exclusion of moisture). The triethylammonium hydrochloride cake is washed with dry tetrahydrofuran (3 × 105 mL, KF < 50 μg/mL). The filtrate and washes are combined and used as is in the next reaction and.
This crude material may be used directly in many preparations such as p-acetaminobenzenesulfinic acid (p. 7). If a pure product is desired, the crude material is dried by pressing on a porous plate and then crystallized from dry benzene. The acid chloride is slightly soluble in benzene, and only 1.5 to 2 g. will dissolve in 100 cc. of hot benzene. On cooling, about 75 per cent of the material separates from the benzene in thick, colorless prisms melting at 149°.
A solution of 24 g. (0.6 mole) of sodium hydroxide, 100 ml. of water, and 55 g. (0.5 mole) of resorcinol is placed in an apparatus for high-pressure hydrogenation together with 10 g. of reduced Universal Oil Products hydrogenation catalyst or Raney nickel (see p. 181). The pressure in the bomb is raised to 1000–1500 lb. with hydrogen, and the temperature is adjusted to 50°. The bomb is shaken and the reaction allowed to proceed for 10 to 12 hours, during which time 0.5 mole of hydrogen is absorbed.
In the meantime, 552 g. (4 moles) of good commercial m-nitroaniline, melting at 110° or above, is dissolved in a mixture of 500 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) and 1 l. of hot water; 1100 cc. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is then added, and the solution is cooled rapidly, with stirring. It is then surrounded with a freezing mixture, and diazotized at a temperature below 1° by adding, with constant stirring, a solution of 288 g. (4 moles) of technical (95 per cent) sodium nitrite in 700 cc. of water, care being taken to avoid adding an excess over that necessary to produce a distinct reaction with starch-iodide paper (p. 49). This point is reached when all but about 25 cc. of the nitrite solution has been added; the addition requires about one and one-half hours. The cold solution is now filtered in order to remove some amorphous insoluble matter; this solid, when dry, weighs 50–55 g.
The distilling flask is gradually heated in an oil bath until the temperature of the bath is 200°, and 100 g. (0.55 mole) of β-bromostyrene is then dropped in upon the molten potassium hydroxide, at the rate of somewhat less than a drop a second. Since the boiling point of phenylacetylene is 142–143°, and that of bromostyrene is 218–220°, the phenylacetylene distils away from the unchanged bromostyrene.
The aqueous residue from the three extractions with toluene yields, when the bulk of the water has been distilled off on the steam bath under reduced pressure, a further quantity of catechol by extraction with hot toluene, but the crystals so obtained are contaminated with a red impurity. It is therefore preferable to distil the entire residue, again collecting the fraction boiling at 124–125° /12 mm. and recrystallizing it from fresh toluene. In this way 295–305 g. of pure product is obtained. The forerun contains a little aqueous hydrobromic acid, which may be employed in a subsequent batch. The total yield of pure catechol is 690–705 g. (85–87 per cent of the theoretical amount).
5. Wash the resin with distilled water (downflow) until the salts are all washed out and the pH of the washings is 5.6–6.5. The column is now ready for use.
The concentration of the hypochlorous acid solution is determined by adding a measured volume to an excess of potassium iodide solution acidified with hydrochloric acid, and titrating with standard thiosulfate solution. Usually the concentration is found to be between 3.5 and 4 per cent. The amount necessary to react with 123 g. (1.5 moles) of cyclohexene is calculated.
A 100-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirring bar and a rubber septum is evacuated and flame-dried under vacuum, then flushed with dry argon. This process is repeated 3 times. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (36 mL,) and distilled thiophene (3.05 g, 2.91 mL, 36.3 mmol,) are injected via syringe and the resulting solution is cooled to −78°C. Butyllithium in hexanes (12.8 mL, 2.83 M, 36.3 mmol,) is added dropwise via syringe. The resulting light-yellow solution is warmed to −20°C using a solid dry ice–carbon tetrachloride bath and stirred for 20 min.
D. 3(5)-Aminopyrazole. (Caution! Because hydrogen gas is evolved, this reaction should be conducted in an efficient hood in the absence of an ignition source.) A solution of sodium isopropoxide is prepared from 18.4 g. (0.80 g. atom) of sodium and 500 ml. of isopropyl alcohol in a 2-l. four-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, a reflux condenser, and a stopper. The reflux condenser is fitted with a nitrogen-inlet line attached to a bubbler device to maintain an anhydrous atmosphere. After all the sodium has dissolved, the temperature is adjusted to 60–70°, the stopper is replaced by a wide-mouthed funnel, and 191 g. (0.80 mole) of 3-imino-1-(p-tolylsulfonyl)-pyrazolidine is added gradually over 10 minutes to the hot solution under a blanket of nitrogen. The funnel is replaced by the stopper, and the mixture is stirred vigorously and then refluxed briefly. Stirring is continued, and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature during 2 hours. The precipitated sodium p-toluenesulfinate (140–142 g.) is removed by filtration and washed with a total of 100 ml. of isopropyl alcohol in several portions. The filtrate is treated twice with 4-g. portions of Norit activated carbon. The solvent is removed by distillation, the final trace being removed at a bath temperature of 50° (20 mm.) to give 62–66 g. (93–99%) of 3(5)-aminopyrazole as a light yellow oil. This is purified by distillation to give the product as a yellow oil, b.p. 100–102° (0.01 mm.), in 74–84% recovery. The product crystallizes on cooling; m.p. 37–39°. Its n.m.r. spectrum (60 MHz, dimethyl sulfoxide-d6) shows two one-proton doublets at δ 7.33 and 5.52 p.p.m. (J = 2 Hz) and a broad three-proton singlet at δ 7.05 p.p.m. that is absent after addition of D2O.
A. Nitroso-tert-octane.2 To a 1-L, three-necked flask equipped with an addition funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer are added 120 mL of methanol, 51.7 g of tert-octylamine (0.4 mol), and 90 mL of water containing 1.2 g (0.0028 mol) of the tetrasodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 2.52 g (0.0076 mol) of sodium tungstate dihydrate. The solution is cooled to 15°C in an ice bath and hydrogen peroxide (361 mL of a 16% solution, 1.7 mol) and is added over 5 hr. The blue reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 16 hr and the product is extracted with petroleum ether (3 × 50 mL). Unreacted amine is removed by washing twice with 2 N hydrochloric acid. After the blue organic layer is washed with brine, it is dried over MgSO4. Petroleum ether is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure. Continued distillation of the product affords 29.7 g of nitroso-tert-octane (52%), bp 45–55°C, 18 mm. On standing, the product crystallizes as the colorless dimer, mp 63–65°C. For use in the subsequent reaction the required amount of the dimer is stirred for 1 hr in hexane to establish monomer–dimer equilibrium and.
The reaction flask is removed from the oil bath, and the solution is poured into a 250-ml. beaker to crystallize; 10 ml. of benzene is used to rinse out the flask. When crystallization sets in, 50 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 35–55°) is added to the warm mixture with manual stirring. After the mixture has been chilled in an ice bath, the product is filtered by suction and washed with 100 ml. of a 1:1 petroleum ether-benzene mixture. It is then removed from the funnel, stirred into a slurry with 100 ml. of the mixed solvent, filtered, and again washed with 50 ml. of the solvent. These washings remove the bulk of the color, and a powdery white product remains. After standing overnight in a warm place, the product weighs 35.5–36.5 g. (74–76%) and melts at 104–105°. It may be purified further by recrystallization from benzene (3.7 ml. per g.). The yield of colorless benzoylacetanilide melting at 106–106.5° cor, is 32–34 g.
When the required amount of chlorotrifluoroethylene has been absorbed, the reaction mixture is poured into 500 ml. of water. The product separates as a light-yellow oil, which is separated, washed with 250 ml. of water, and dried over 20 g. of anhydrous calcium chloride. From 233 g. of chlorotrifluoroethylene (2 moles), the yield of crude product is 300–315 g. (92–97%). This material is suitable for use in preparation of ethyl chlorofluoroacetate (p. 423). It may be fractionated through an efficent column to give 285–300 g. (88–92%) of pure chlorotrifluoroethyl ethyl ether, b.p. 87–88°, n25D 1.3427.
The alkaline filtrate and washings are combined and partially neutralized by the addition of 150–175 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid. Sufficient sodium sulfide solution is added to precipitate all the lead ion present. The suspension is brought to a gentle boil to coagulate the lead sulfide, allowed to cool somewhat, and filtered with suction. The filtrate is placed in a 2-l. beaker set in an ice bath and acidified (Caution! in the hood) with about 150 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid to precipitate crude 2-hydroxyisophthalic acid monohydrate. The suspension is cooled to 0–5° and filtered to separate the crude acid, which weighs 35–49 g. after being dried in a vacuum oven at 110°/50–150 mm. for 5 hours.
A. 2,3-Dibromopropionaldehyde diethyl acetal. A 500-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a thermometer. The flask and dropping funnel are charged with 28.0 g. (0.500 mole) of freshly distilled acrolein and 80.0 g. (0.500 mole) of bromine, respectively. The acrolein is stirred rapidly and cooled to 0° in an ice–salt bath, then bromine is added at a rate such that the temperature is kept at 0–5°, until a permanent red color indicates a slight excess of bromine in the flask. A total of 78–79 g. of bromine is added over a 1-hour period. The crude 2,3-dibromopropionaldehyde is stirred while a solution of 80 g. (0.54 mole) of freshly distilled triethyl orthoformate in 65 ml. of absolute ethanol is added over 15 minutes. The solution warms to 45° and is stirred for 3 hours, after which ethyl formate, ethanol, and triethyl orthoformate are removed on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the residual liquid through a 15-cm. Vigreux column affords 107–112 g. (74–77%) of 2,3-dibromopropionaldehyde diethyl acetal, b.p. 113–115° (11 mm.), as a pale-yellow liquid.
A. 4-(1-Phenyl-5-tetrazolyloxy)biphenyl. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask fitted with an efficient condenser and a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 17 g. (0.10 mole) of 4-phenylphenol, 18.1 g. (0.100 mole) of 1-phenyl-5-chlorotetrazole, 27.6 g. (0.200 mole) of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 250 ml. of acetone. The mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 18 hours. Water (250 ml.) is added to the hot mixture producing a clear solution that is chilled in ice. After 1 hour, the solid is collected by filtration and dried in air, giving 32–33 g. of the crude product, m.p. 151–153°, which is then dissolved in 250 ml. of hot ethyl acetate. The solution is filtered while hot to remove a small amount of insoluble material and cooled on ice, yielding 25 g. of 4-(1-phenyl-5-tetrazolyloxy)biphenyl, as white crystals, m.p. 150–153°. An additional 2–3 g. of product is recovered from the filtrate by concentration to 125 ml. bringing the total yield to 27–28 g. (86–89%).
The flask is next fitted for distillation with superheated steam and with a separatory funnel for the introduction of water into the center of the flask. A 3-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a vertical condenser is used as a receiver (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 479). The temperature of the oil bath is raised to 160°, and superheated steam at 220–250° is introduced. The temperature of the oil bath is then gradually raised to 200°. If foaming becomes too great, a few drops of water are added from the separatory funnel, care being taken that the water does not strike the hot glass walls. Steam distillation is continued until no more dimethylpyrrole comes over. This takes from one to two hours, and the distillate amounts to 2.5–3 l. The distillate is extracted once with 200 cc. of ether and three times with 100-cc. portions, and the extract is dried for two hours over 20 g. of anhydrous potassium carbonate. The ether is removed by distillation from a 100-cc. modified Claisen flask having a 15-cm. fractionating side arm, the solution being added gradually through a separatory funnel. After the ether is removed the residue is distilled and the fraction boiling at 160–165° is collected. The yield is 27 to 30 g. (57–63 per cent of the theoretical amount) and.
This complex (7.1 g, 7.0 mmol) is treated with 150 mL of 0.75 N aqueous sodium hydroxide and the mixture is extracted with two 150-mL portions of chloroform. The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of 0.75 N sodium hydroxide and water and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the solvent is evaporated. The residue is washed with 20 mL of cold ethyl acetate to furnish 5.3 g of white solid, which is dried at 80°C (0.05 mm) overnight to give 4.6 g (100% based on the complex used) of (S)-BINAPO, mp 256–258°C, [α]D25 −392° (benzene, c 0.530).
The o-iodophenol solidifies upon cooling. The yield of material melting at 32–34° is 70 g. (63 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product obtained in this way is slightly yellow. If a purer product is desired, it may be redistilled under reduced pressure. Most of the crude material will distil over a 5° range (b.p. 130°/18 mm. and 186°/160 mm., m.p. 43°).
To obtain the trimethylamine hydrochloride, the hydrochloric acid solution is evaporated, first over a free flame, and later, when the crystals start to form, on a steam bath. As the solution gets more and more concentrated, the trimethylamine hydrochloride crystallizes out and is filtered from time to time, dried for a few minutes in an air bath (temperature 100–110°), and then kept in a tightly closed bottle. If the trimethylamine hydrochloride as it crystallizes is centrifuged, the product is obtained pure and dry at once. The average yield from four runs is 710 g. of pure trimethylamine hydrochloride and 82 g. of product which is tinged slightly yellow (a total of 89 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the ammonium chloride). The coloration results from the evaporation to dryness of the very last portion of solution.
The condenser is arranged for downward distillation, and a total of 650 ml. of ketone-water mixture is collected as distillate. Sufficient potassium carbonate is added to saturate the aqueous layer, and about 130 ml. of ketone is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether, and the combined ether and ketone layers are dried over 25 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The product remaining after removal of the ether is distilled through an efficient column. The yield of dicyclopropyl ketone boiling at 72–74°/33 mm., nD25 1.4654, is 114–121 g. (52–55%).
In a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted for vacuum distillation with a short path distilling head, a condenser, and a 250-ml. receiving flask is placed 100 g. (1.0 mole) of a mixture of cyclopentenediols.2 A few Carborundum boiling chips are added. The receiver is cooled in ice and the mixture heated to 50–55°. At this time, the flask is opened momentarily and 1–2 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate is added. The flask is immediately closed and the pressure is reduced to 10–15 mm. Careful heating is continued, and a mixture of 2-cyclopentenone and water begins to distil with the temperature in the distilling head rising from 45° to 60°. The temperature of the flask is gradually increased as necessary to maintain a reasonably rapid distillation rate.
A. Heptaldehyde enol acetate. A mixture of 285 g. (335 ml., 2.5 moles) of heptaldehyde, 612 g. (566 ml., 6 moles) of acetic anhydride, and 49 g. (0.5 mole) of powdered potassium acetate is placed in a 2-l. flask fitted with a reflux condenser. The flask is heated in an oil bath kept at 155–160° for 1 hour. The mixture is then allowed to cool, placed in a 2-l. separatory funnel, washed several times with warm water to remove the excess acetic anhydride, and finally washed with 5% sodium carbonate solution. The resultant oil is fractionated under reduced pressure through an efficient column. The initial fraction consists of pure heptaldehyde followed by heptaldehyde containing heptaldehyde enol acetate. The fraction boiling at 88–90°/17 mm. is pure enol acetate, nD25 1.4295–1.4305; d425 0.880–0.884. The yield is 175–195 g. (45–50%).
Alanine so prepared is sufficiently pure for most purposes. It may be recrystallized by dissolving in the least amount of hot water (about 450 cc.) and adding two volumes of alcohol.
The mixture is cooled and poured onto a mixture of 200 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, 200 ml. of ether, and 100 g. of ice. The residue in the flask is dissolved in a mixture of 6N hydrochloric acid and methylene chloride, and this mixture is added to the main reaction. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted with two 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ethereal solution is washed once with 70 ml. of 6N hydrochloric acid, once with 2N sodium carbonate solution, twice with saturated sodium chloride solution, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under reduced pressure, and the residue is distilled to yield 16–17 g. (72–76%) of colorless 2-benzylcyclopentanone, b.p. 83–85° (0.3 mm.), 108–110° (0.75 mm.).
A. α-Bromoisobutyryl bromide. To a mixture of 250 g. (2.85 moles) of isobutyric acid and 35 g. (0.28 mole) of red phosphorus in a 1-l. three-necked flask, fitted by ground-glass joints to a dropping funnel, mechanical stirrer, and reflux condenser, is added, dropwise with stirring, 880 g. (5.5 moles) of bromine. After the addition is complete, the solution is warmed to 100° over a period of 6 hours. The unreacted bromine and hydrogen bromide are removed under reduced pressure (30 mm.). The α-bromoisobutyryl bromide is decanted from the phosphorous acid and fractionated through a short helices-packed column. After a considerable fore-cut, the main fraction, 493–540 g. (75–83%), is collected at 91–98° (100 mm.).
Ether and tert-butyl alcohol are removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure without a column, and the xylene is removed by distillation through a 35-cm. Vigreux column at 25–50 mm. The residue is transferred to a smaller flask, and the acetophenone is first distilled at about 80°/10 mm., and finally the dypnone is distilled at 150–155°/1 mm. and. The yield is 85–91 g. (77–82%) of a yellow liquid.
In a 1-l. wide-mouthed bottle with a glass stopper, 400 cc. of acetic anhydride is cooled to −10° in a freezing mixture and 36 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid is added at once with constant stirring. The temperature of the solution rises to about 20°. The bottle is removed from the freezing mixture, and 20 g. of absorbent cotton is worked into the liquor immediately with a heavy glass rod. With constant stirring, the bottle is warmed in a water bath maintained at 60° until the temperature of the mixture reaches 45° (about ten minutes), and then it is removed and the temperature is kept from rising above 55° by suitable cooling with running water, stirring being continued throughout. After about twenty minutes (total) the mixture becomes thin; at this point it is cooled to 50° and a second 20-g. portion of cotton is added with stirring, the temperature again being kept from rising above 55°. The process of cooling to 50° and adding 20 g. of cotton is repeated at intervals of about ten minutes until 100 g. of cotton in all has been introduced. After the final addition stirring is continued until the mixture becomes thin (about ten minutes); then the bottle is stoppered and heated in a bath maintained at 50° for one hour, during which time the cotton dissolves completely to a thin, light brown syrup. The stoppered container is kept in an oven at 35° for seven days.
C. Cyclobutanone. The resulting solution of oxaspiropentane (35%) in 200 ml. dichloromethane is added dropwise at room temperature to a magnetically stirred solution containing 5–10 mg. of lithium iodide in 50 ml. of dichloromethane,, at such a rate as to maintain gentle reflux of the solvent. After the addition, when the reaction mixture returns to room temperature, the transformation into cyclobutanone is complete. The dichloromethane solution is washed with 20 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium thiosulfate and 20 ml. of water, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation of the solvent through a 15-cm., helix-packed, vacuum-insulated column. The residual liquid consists of cyclobutanone (95%) and 3-buten-2-one and 2-methylpropenal (5%).2 A final distillation at 760 mm. through a 50-cm., stainless-steel spinning band column yields 41 g. (64% from methylenecyclopropane) of pure cyclobutanone, b.p. 100–101°,.
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stirrer, separatory funnel, and a reflux condenser to the upper end of which a calcium chloride tube is attached, is placed 150 g. (6.2 atoms) of magnesium turnings. A small crystal of iodine and about 100 cc. of a mixture of 822 g. (6 moles) of n-butyl bromide (p. 28) and 2 l. of anhydrous ethyl ether are added. As soon as the reaction starts, 350 cc. of anhydrous ether is added, and the remainder of the n-butyl bromide solution is dropped in at such a rate that the mixture boils continuously. The time of addition (one and one-half hours) may be decreased by cooling the flask externally. Stirring is started as soon as enough liquid is present in the flask.
The filtrate contains guanidine nitrate along with a small amount of ammonium nitrate and very small amounts of dicyanodiamide and biguanide nitrate. The solution is concentrated to about 1 l., and the guanidine nitrate which crystallizes on cooling is filtered off. A second crop is obtained by concentrating to 250 cc.. The combined yield of crude guanidine nitrate is 520–560 g. (85–92 per cent of the theoretical amount). The product may be purified by recrystallization from 1 l. of water, a second crop being taken after the mother liquor has been concentrated to 250 cc. The yield of recrystallized guanidine nitrate melting at 213–214° amounts to 500–520 g..
The total amount of original reaction mixture requires five distillations similar to the one just described. The first distillates from each of the five distillations are mixed, and the layer of mesitylene is separated from the water. This is shaken with sodium hydroxide solution until no more odor of sulfur dioxide is noticeable, then washed twice with water and distilled. The first portion of the distillate consists of a small amount of water and mesitylene and is added to the combined second distillates. The fraction which distils up to 210° is saved. The second distillates are combined, washed in the same way as the first, and then distilled; the fraction which distils up to 210° is combined with the corresponding fraction from the first distillates.
A. 7,7-Dibromo-1,6-dimethylbicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene. Into a 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, 1-L addition funnel, and reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen-inlet tube are introduced 44.8 g (0.4 mol) of powdered potassium tert-butoxide and 1 L of olefin-free petroleum ether (bp 35–55°C;). To this stirred mixture is added a solution containing 38.0 g (0.35 mol) of 1,2-dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexadiene in 200 mL of the same solvent. With external cooling from an ice bath and under nitrogen, 102.4 g (0.4 mol) of bromoform in 400 mL of petroleum ether is added dropwise during 1 hr. The ice bath is removed and the resultant slurry is stirred at room temperature under nitrogen for 6 hr. Water (500 mL) is added and the mixture is poured into a 3-L separatory funnel containing 300 mL of benzene. The organic layer is washed with four 500-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Further evacuation at 0.5 mm produces a solid that is recrystallized from ether–petroleum ether (1 : 3) to afford 55–62 g (56.5–63.5%) of colorless solid, mp 95–98°C.
The crude solid is purified by dissolving it in 50 ml. of petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°) and introducing it on a short alumina column (15 g., Brockmann Activity 1 or an equivalent chromatographic alumina). The column is then eluted with 300 ml. of a 1:9 mixture of ether-petroleum ether (b.p. 40–60°). Concentration of the eluate leaves a solid which is recrystallized from aqueous ethanol to give 1.4–1.6 g. (70–80%) of diphenyldiacetylene as large colorless needles, m.p. 87–88°.
B. 2-(1-Mercapto-1-methylethyl)-5-methylcyclohexanol (7-thiomenthol). A 5-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a variable speed Hershberg stirrer and a 500-mL Dewar condenser filled with dry ice–acetone and connected by its upper joint to a mineral oil bubbler through which passes dry nitrogen gas. The flask is immersed in a dry ice–acetone bath, flushed well with nitrogen and 3000 mL of ammonia is condensed into the flask via a glass tube passed through a rubber septum in the remaining neck of the flask. Clean sodium, 125 g (5.43 g-atom), is added slowly to the ammonia with slow stirring. Then 250.3 g (0.906 mol) of 5-methyl-2-[1-methyl-1-(phenylmethylthio)ethyl]cyclohexanone and 72.5 mL (1.8 mol) of methanol in 625 mL of anhydrous ether are added dropwise via a pressure-equalized addition funnel over 5 hr to the vigorously stirred (ca. 500 rpm) solution. Stirring is continued an additional 30 min following which 150 mL of methanol is added over 2.5 hr dropwise (to avoid a violent eruption). The solution is allowed to warm slowly and the addition funnel and the condenser are removed to allow the ammonia to evaporate overnight. The reaction flask is immersed in an ice bath and 700 mL of water is added cautiously over an hour to the yellow solid left by evaporation of the ammonia. The solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted with two 200-mL portions of ether, which are discarded. The aqueous layer is poured into a mixture of 500 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1000 g of ice, transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel, and extracted with four 200-mL portions of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed with 200 mL of water and 200 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by rotary evaporation at aspirator vacuum. The residual liquid is placed under reduced pressure (0.2 mm) for 1 hr to remove the remaining solvent to give 137–140 g (80–82%) of an orange oil that is a diastereomeric mixture of which the major component constitutes 80%, as indicated by 13C NMR.
A. The Grignard reagent 2. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is equipped with a 100-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, a glass stopper, and a two-way stopcock to which is attached a T-piece connected at one end to a supply of nitrogen, and at the other to an oil bubbler. The flask is charged with a solution of isobutylmagnesium chloride in ether (320 mL, 0.75 M, 240 mmol) and and immersed in an ice–water bath. Titanocene dichloride (1.3 g, 5.2 mmol) is added at once and the resulting solution is allowed to stir at 0°C for 10 min. A solution of 2-octyn-1-ol (1) (13.2 g, 105 mmol) in ether (30 mL) is placed in the dropping funnel and added dropwise to the flask over 20 min at 0°C. The solution is stirred at room temperature for 4 hr to complete the reaction, affording Grignard reagent 2,(Note 7),(Note 8).
After 10 hr at 55–60°C, 14.2 g (0.1 mol) of sodium sulfite is added and the mixture is refluxed for 3 hr. The hot reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and allowed to stand for 10 min. The organic layer is collected in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask. The aqueous layer is extracted once with 25 mL of CHCl3 that is then combined with the original organic layer. Removal of solvent with a rotary evaporator provides a residue that is transferred to a 350-mL fritted-glass funnel and triturated successively with 200 mL and 100 mL of saturated sodium chloride solution containing 1% sodium hydroxide and finally with two 50-mL portions of distilled water.
A. 3-(1-Hydroxybutyl)-1-methylpyrrole (1). A photochemical quartz immersion well (220 mm length) equipped with 450-W Hanovia medium-pressure mercury lamp and a Vycor filter, cooled with water, is used. To a 125-mL Pyrex reaction vessel (230 mm long, 64 mm i.d.) equipped with a gas inlet and outlet is added 60 mL (55 g, 0.676 mol) of 1-methylpyrrole and 65 mL (54 g, 0.936 mol) of butyraldehyde. Dry nitrogen is slowly bubbled through the solution during 48 hr of photolysis.
1,2,3-Triphenylcyclopropenium bromide. A flame-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet vented through a mineral oil bubbler, glass stopper, and rubber septum, is flushed with argon and charged with a solution of diphenylacetylene (3.92 g, 0.022 mol) and potassium tert-butoxide (9.97 g, 0.089 mol) in dry benzene (100 mL). Efficient magnetic stirring is initiated, and 5.8 mL of α,α-dichlorotoluene (7.2 g, 0.045 mol) is added dropwise over ~5 min via a syringe under argon. The reaction mixture is then heated under reflux for 3 hr during which time the precipitate dissolves. After the reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, 100 mL of water is added to remove inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with portions of ether (2 × 50-mL). The organic layers are combined, dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is saturated with anhydrous hydrogen bromide, whereupon a light yellow precipitate forms that is collected to afford 6.8–7.2 g (89–93%) of essentially pure triphenylcyclopropenium bromide. The material prepared in this manner provides a satisfactory elemental analysis,2 but it can be further purified by recrystallization from acetonitrile, if desired.
The moist histidine-mercury complex is suspended in 5 l. of water and stirred vigorously while a stream of hydrogen sulfide is introduced. When precipitation of mercuric sulfide is complete, the suspension becomes uniformly black and settles sharply on standing. The filtrate and washings from the mercuric sulfide are concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of about 1 l. and cleared with 5 g. of Norite. The filtrate and washings from the Norite are concentrated further to a volume of about 250 cc. and mixed with three volumes of 95 per cent alcohol. Crystallization is induced by cooling the solution and scratching the walls of the vessel; the histidine monohydrochloride separates in plates. After the material has remained in an ice chest for three or four days, the crystals are separated by suction filtration. The yield of crude histidine monohydrochloride is 85–90 g. The filtrate, on standing for several weeks in an ice chest, usually deposits an additional 4–5 g. of material.
A further crop of 40–50 g. may be obtained by removing the alcohol and water until a volume of about 100 cc. remains, and then adding 250 cc. of alcohol and cooling to 0°. The total yield is 140–160 g. (52–60 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 12-l. flask fitted with a stirrer and reflux condenser are placed 188 g. (1 mole) of o-sulfobenzoic imide ("saccharin insoluble"), 565 cc. of distilled water and 188 g. (158 cc.) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19). The mixture is boiled over a free flame with continual stirring until all the solid is in solution; this requires two and one-half to three hours. A second quantity of 188 g. of o-sulfobenzoic imide is then added, and the mixture again heated with stirring until a clear solution results, which requires one and one-half to two hours. Heating is then continued for one hour longer, whereupon the solution is poured into a crock and allowed to cool.
After the green oil has been separated, it is washed with 75 ml. of a warm (Caution!) 20% solution of potassium hydroxide in water to remove, as its potassium salt, the 1,1-dinitropropane formed as a by-product. The remaining 100–110 g. of oil is diluted with 90 ml. of 95% ethanol, and the green solution is cooled in an ice-salt bath to −5° to −10°. The crystalline product is collected on a cold 5.5-cm. Büchner funnel and washed with two 5-ml. portions of ice-cold alcohol. The yield is 50 g. of impure crystals.
B. 3,7-Dithianonane-1,9-dithiol.2 In a 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a magnetic stirring bar are placed 35.0 g (0.178 mol) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-diol, 30.0 g (0.394 mol) of thiourea, and 94 mL of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The mixture is stirred and refluxed for 12 hr. The resulting solution is cooled in an ice bath and 67 g (1.2 mol) of potassium hydroxide dissolved in 400 mL of water is added cautiously. The mixture is then refluxed for 3 hr. The resulting two-phase system is cooled to room temperature and the upper aqueous phase is decanted from the oily organic layer. The aqueous phase is acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and extracted with 300 mL of ether. The ethereal extract is combined with the organic layer from the reaction mixture, and this solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled to give 21.4 g (53%) of 3,7-dithianonane-1,9-dithiol, bp 159–162°C (1.2 mm).
After the solution is diluted with 1200 mL of water, the pH is adjusted to 1–2 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and the mixture stirred at 5°C for 1 hr. The precipitated diphenylphosphinic acid is isolated by filtration and washed with 50 mL of water. The filtrate is placed in a 2000-mL, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a reflux condenser and an efficient mechanical stirrer. A solution of 20 mL of benzaldehyde in 50 mL of ether is added and the mixture is stirred vigorously for 20 min. The precipitate that forms is isolated by filtration and washed sequentially with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of ether to yield 19.6 g (69%) of 7-benzylideneaminotheophylline, mp 207–209°C.3 An analytical sample may be prepared by recrystallization from ethanol (mp 209°C).
A 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a reflux condenser protected by a calcium chloride drying tube. Into the flask are placed 30.0 g (0.14 mol) of di-tert-butyl malonate, 8.4 g (0.28 mol) paraformaldehyde, 1.4 g (0.014 mol) of potassium acetate, 1.4 g (0.007 mol) of cupric acetate monohydrate, and 70 mL of glacial acetic acid. The resulting green–white suspension is placed in an oil bath preheated to 90–100°C and stirred for 2 hr. The reaction mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature, and the reflux condenser is replaced with a short-path distillation apparatus, the vacuum outlet of which is connected in sequence to a trap cooled in acetone–dry ice, a potassium hydroxide trap, another trap cooled in acetone–dry ice, and a vacuum pump. The receiving flask is cooled in acetone–dry ice, and the system is evacuated over approximately 1 hr to remove acetic acid and other volatile material. The bath temperature is increased to 40–50°C for 15 min and then is rapidly raised to 140–150°C to drive over crude product, which is collected over a boiling-point range of 60–82°C. When distillate ceases to come over, the bath temperature is increased to 170°C and distillate is collected over the same boiling-point range until the reaction mixture turns from blue to green–brown. The total amount of crude product collected is 24.3 g. This material is dissolved in 50 mL of ether and washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (4 × 20 mL) and water (25 mL). The combined aqueous fractions are extracted with 50 mL of ether, and the combined ether extracts are dried over magnesium sulfate for 10 min. Filtration and evaporation on a rotary evaporator give 20.0 g of crude product, which is distilled through an 8-cm Vigreux column. The di-tert-butyl methylenemalonate is collected at 60–67°C/0.1 mm and weighs 15.3 g (48%). The product is somewhat unstable and should be stored in Pyrex in the refrigerator.
C. D. (1R)-1,3,4-Trimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde. A 100-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask containing a magnetic stirring bar is equipped with a rubber septum and a three-way stopcock with an argon inlet. The air is displaced by repeated flushing with dry argon. The flask is charged with 1.57 g (5 mmol) of mono(2,6-dimethoxybenzoyl)tartaric acid obtained in Part B and 50 mL of dry dichloromethane, and cooled in an ice bath. Through the septum, with a syringe, is added dropwise 3.57 mL (5 mmol) of borane-THF solution (1.40 M) at 0°C over a period of 30 min. The reaction mixture is stirred for 15 min at 0°C and then cooled to −78°C in a dry ice-methanol bath. To this solution is added 4.14 mL (50 mmol) of freshly distilled methacrolein via a syringe dropwise. After the addition is complete, 8.49 mL (75 mmol) of 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene is introduced to the solution at the same temperature and the mixture is stirred for 12 hr. The cold reaction mixture is poured into 150 mL of ice-cold saturated sodium bicarbonate and the product is extracted with three 200-mL portions of hexane. The combined organic phases are washed with brine (2 × 200 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at atmospheric pressure. The residue is distilled at reduced pressure to afford 6.53 g (86%) of (1R)-1,3,4-trimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carboxaldehyde as a colorless liquid, bp 92–93°C (23 mm).
C. 1,1-Dimethylethyl (S)-4-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-3-oxazolidinecarboxylate. A dry, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septa, three-way balloon adapter, and a low temperature thermometer. After the flask is purged with nitrogen, a solution of the oxazolidine ester (40.2 g, 0.15 mol) in dry toluene (300 mL,) is added via cannula (using positive nitrogen pressure) and cooled to −78°C with an acetone-dry ice bath. To this cooled solution is added a −78°C solution of 1.5 M diisobutylaluminum hydride in toluene (175 mL,) via cannula (using positive nitrogen pressure). The rate of addition is adjusted so as to keep the internal temperature below −65°C and takes approximately 1 hr to complete. The reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hr at −78°C under an atmosphere of nitrogen when TLC anlaysis shows the reaction to be complete. The reaction is quenched by slowly adding 60 mL of cold (−78°C) methanol (Evolution of hydrogen occurs!)—again keeping the internal temperature below −65°C. The resulting white emulsion is slowly poured into 1000 mL of ice-cold 1 N hydrochloric acid with swirling over 15 min, and the aqueous mixture is then extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 1000 mL). The combined organic layers are washed with brine (1000 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated to give 33.6 g of crude product as a colorless oil. This material is vacuum distilled through a 10-cm Vigreux column to give 26.9 g (76% yield) of oxazolidine aldehyde as a colorless liquid, bp 83–88°C (1.0–1.4 mm).
Two hundred and forty grams (0.8 mole) of the dried ricinoleic acid is dissolved in 1.6 l. of water containing 64 g. of potassium hydroxide. A 12-l. round-bottomed flask is equipped with a powerful mechanical stirrer, and in it are placed 625 g. (3.5 moles) of potassium permanganate and 7.5 l. of water at 35°. The mixture is stirred to facilitate solution of the permanganate, and, if necessary, heat is applied to maintain the temperature at 35°. When the permanganate has completely dissolved, the alkaline solution of ricinoleic acid is added in a single portion with vigorous stirring. The temperature rises rapidly to about 75°. Stirring is continued for a half hour, or until a test portion added to water shows no permanganate color.
When all the sodium has dissolved, the phenoxide-phenol mixture is heated to 150°. With the oil bath or heating mantle still surrounding the flask, and with a protective shield between the reaction vessel and the operator, the cold ethereal chloramine solution is added with rapid stirring in a thin stream from the dropping funnel at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not drop below 125°. Best results are obtained if the thin stream of ether solution can be added directly to the molten mass without first touching the walls of the flask.
E. Tris[N-(tert-butyl)(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-amido]molybdenum(VI) propylidyne (5). A 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a rubber septum, a magnetic stirring bar, and a gas inlet connected to the argon/vacuum manifold is flame-dried and back-filled with argon. Molybdenum trisamide 4 (5.31 g, 8.48 mmol), magnesium turnings (2.54 g, 106 mmol) and THF (160 mL) are added to the flask by removal of the septum. To the stirred solution, 1,1-dichloropropane (1.7 mL, 17 mmol) is added dropwise via syringe within 5 min, resulting in a color change from red to dark amber. The resulting mixture is stirred for 2.5 h at room temperature under argon. The rubber septum is replaced by a distillation head connected to the vacuum line, the solvent is removed under reduced pressure (approximately 7.5 mmHg), and the residue is redissolved in pentane (100 mL). After vigorous stirring/manual shaking, the solid precipitate (MgCl2) and excess magnesium turnings are removed by filtration under argon. The filtrate is concentrated to approximately 1/10 of its volume and slowly cooled to −78 °C, causing the molybdenum propylidyne complex to precipitate. The supernatant is removed via cannula and the remaining beige crystals are dried under vacuum (10−3 mbar) (3.08 g, 54%).
The isoleucine is recrystallized by dissolving it in 850 ml. of water heated to 95° on a steam cone. The solution is decolorized by treatment with a gram of Norit for 30 minutes and is then filtered hot. To the hot solution is added 425 ml. of 95% ethanol. and the flask is placed in an ice chest overnight. The yield of pure product is 38 g. An additional crop of 12 g. may be obtained by concentrating the mother liquors from the recrystallization to about 100 ml. and adding an equal volume of ethanol. This second crop is washed with 10 ml. of cold water and 10 ml. of cold ethanol. The total yield is 50 g. (49%). The product decomposes at 278–280° in a sealed evacuated capillary.
B. Hexafluoroacetone. A 1-L, three-necked flask is fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, thermometer, and condenser. A −78°C glass trap is attached to the condenser via flexible tubing. While the system is purged with nitrogen, 3 g of potassium fluoride is added and the flask and potassium fluoride are flame-dried. After the flask has cooled, 300 mL of dry dimethylformamide, 80 g (0.374 mol) of powdered potassium iodate, and 60 g (0.165 mol) of 2,2,4,4-tetrakis(trifluoromethyl)-1,3-dithietane are added. The stirrer and water condenser are started and the reaction mixture is heated over a 45-min period to 149°C and is kept at 149°C for an additional 15 min. The heat source is then removed, and a slow stream of nitrogen is used to flush any remaining product gas into the cold trap. The condensate is transferred under vacuum to a tared, evacuated-gas cylinder. The cylinder contains 37.0–39.9 g (68–73%) of material. This material is distilled to give 35.0–37.6 g (64–69%) of pure product, bp −28°C [lit.2 bp −27°C].
A. 2-Chloro-2-methylcylohexanone. A 3-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer with glass blade, a dropping funnel, and an outlet tube connected to a gas-absorption trap,2 is charged with a solution of 224 g. (2.0 moles) of 2-methylcyclohexanone in 1 l. of dry carbon tetrachloride. A solution of 179 ml. (297 g., 2.2 moles) of sulfuryl chloride in 300 ml. of dry carbon tetrachloride is added from the dropping funnel over a 1-hour period with stirring. The slightly exothermic reaction is moderated by cooling the flask with a bath of water at room temperature. After the addition is complete, stirring is continued for 2 hours. The yellow solution is then washed successively with three 300-ml. portions of water, two 200-ml. portions of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and one 200-ml. portion of saturated salt solution, and finally dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate.
The salt is dissolved in 270 ml. of water, and 100 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added. The ethyl oxalylsuccinate separates as an oil and rises to the surface. It is removed by extracting the mixture with 100-ml. portions of ether until the aqueous solution is almost colorless. The extracts are dried over sodium sulfate, and the ether is distilled under reduced pressure. The ethyl oxalylsuccinate remains in the flask as a yellow oil. The yield is 225–227 g. (82–83%).
B. N-[2-(2-Chloroethoxy)ethyl]acetamide. N-[2-(2-Hydroxyethoxy)ethyl]-acetamide (20.58 g, 0.14 mol) in 30 mL of chloroform is placed in an oven-dried, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask that contains a magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, condenser that is connected by a polyethylene tube to a glass funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is cooled in an ice bath and the glass funnel is immersed in a beaker of water. Thionyl chloride (28 g, 0.24 mol) in 25 mL of chloroform is added dropwise to the stirring mixture at 10–15°C. The mixture is then stirred at room temperature for 30 min and under reflux for 20 min. It is immediately cooled to 30°C and the solvent and excess thionyl chloride are removed on a rotary evaporator. The residue is immediately distilled through an 8-cm Vigreux column using an oil bath to give 17–18 g (73–77%) of N-[2-(2-chloroethoxy)ethyl]acetamide, bp 105–108°C/0.1 mm.
The sodium acetate is then extracted by digesting the sifted dye for ten to fifteen minutes with successive 500-cc. portions of boiling 95 per cent ethyl alcohol, filtering with suction after each extraction, and washing the product on the filter with a little alcohol. After four alcohol extractions the filtrate should give a negative test for acetate. The product, which changes in appearance from bronze to green during the extraction, is dried in air at room temperature. The yield is 80–81 g. (83–84 per cent of the theoretical amount) of dye free from inorganic salts and organic impurities.
A suspension of the material in 600 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is stirred mechanically in a 3-l. beaker which is set in an ice-salt bath. A solution of 46 g. of sodium nitrite in 150 ml. of water in a 250-ml. dropping funnel fixed with its stem below the surface of the suspension is added slowly while the temperature of the mixture is kept at 4–5°. After the addition is completed (in approximately 80 minutes), stirring in the ice-salt bath is continued for 1 hour to crystallize completely the stannichloride of the diazonium salt. The reddish brown salt is filtered on a sintered glass funnel.
A 1-l. Claisen flask fitted with a dropping funnel and a thermometer dipping into the liquid is attached to a condenser set for downward distillation. In the flask are placed 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, 200 g. (108 ml.) of concentrated sulfuric acid, and 100 ml. of water. The flask is heated over a wire gauze, and while the internal temperature is maintained at 130–135°, the diazonium solution, in 25-ml. portions, is added at the same rate as the distillate is collected. When this operation has been completed, 200 ml. of water, in 25-ml. portions, is introduced and the distillation is continued until an additional 200 ml. of distillate has been collected. The complete distillation requires 3–3.5 hours.
A 2-l., three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a calcium chloride drying tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel is charged with 53.4 g. (0.400 mole) of anhydrous aluminum chloride and 800 ml. of dichloromethane. The flask is placed in an acetone–dry ice bath, and the mixture is stirred for a few minutes before slowly adding a solution of 36.9 g. (0.200 mole) of (4-methoxyphenyl)acetyl chloride in 200 ml. of dichloromethane over 45 minutes. When the addition is complete, the funnel is replaced with a gas-inlet tube, and ethylene is bubbled vigorously into the flask for about 10 minutes. The gas-inlet tube is replaced with a stopper, the cooling bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature, then stirred for 3–3.5 hours. The reaction mixture is cooled in an ice bath while 250 ml. of ice water is added carefully. The mixture is stirred until all of the solid material is dissolved. The yellow organic layer is separated, washed two times with 150-ml. portions of 5% hydrochloric acid and two times with 150-ml. portions of saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate. The organic layer is dried over magnesium sulfate and filtered. The solvent is distilled with a rotary evaporator, keeping the bath temperature under 60°. Distillation of the yellow residue through a 15-cm. Vigreux column gives 21–24 g. (60–68%) of 6-methoxy-β-tetralone, b.p. 114–116° (0.2 mm.), which solidifies to a white solid on standing in the refrigerator, m.p. 33.5–35°.
The crude product is dissolved in 75 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol at a temperature of 40°, which is sufficient to ensure complete solution. The alcoholic solution is cooled to 12° and and filtered. The yield of air-dried, colorless product melting at 52.5–53.5° is 95–110 g. (47–55 per cent of the theoretical amount). By evaporation of the alcohol, distillation of the residue under reduced pressure, and recrystallization of the solidified distillate, the yield may be increased to 110–115 g. (55–57 per cent of the theoretical amount).
To the resulting slurry of vinylmagnesium bromide (with the condenser still maintained at −78°C) is added via cannula a solution of 61.3 g (0.307 mol) of trimethyltin chloride in 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran at a rate suitable to maintain a gentle reflux. The temperature is maintained at 60°C for 5 hr and then the mixture is cooled to room temperature. With the condenser still maintained at −78°C, 200 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution is added by syringe at a rate that maintains a gentle reflux, followed by 200 mL of water. The resulting solution is transferred to a separatory funnel with the aid of 200 mL of pentane and the organic layer is washed with 250 mL of a saturated ammonium chloride solution. The combined aqueous layers are back-extracted twice with 250 mL of pentane, and the combined organic layers are washed 5 times with 250 mL of saturated ammonium chloride, 10 times with a 10% hydrochloric acid solution, and twice with a saturated sodium chloride solution, and then gravity-filtered through a 9 × 4-cm pad of silica gel to give approximately 500 mL of a slightly yellow solution. Pentanes are removed by distillation using a 16-cm Vigreux column and a short-path stillhead. Continued distillation affords a fraction boiling from 60–90°C, which contains a mixture of 4.9 g of trimethylvinyltin in 16.3 g of tetrahydrofuran. At this point the still is cooled to room temperature, the Vigreux column is removed, and the remaining oil is distilled at 95–100°C to give 38–39 g (64–66% purified yield) of trimethylvinyltin.
A solution of 368 g. of 96% sulfuric acid in 664 ml. of water is cooled to room temperature and placed in a 3-l. three-necked flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel. To this acid solution is added 114 g. (1 mole) of 2-methylcyclohexanol. A mixture of 220 g. (2.2 moles) of chromic oxide in 368 g. of 96% sulfuric acid and 664 ml. of water is added from the dropping funnel to the 2-methylcyclohexanol suspension at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture remains at 30 ± 2°. Good agitation and an ice bath are necessary to control the temperature in this range. The mixture is stirred at 30 ± 2° for 1 hour and then at room temperature until all the chromic oxide is consumed. The sulfuric acid solution is extracted with ether until the returns from the ether extractions fall to an insignificant amount. Approximately 10 extractions with 200-ml. portions of ether are required. The ether extracts are combined, and the ether is removed by distillation on the steam bath. The resulting crude δ-acetyl-n-valeric acid is a yellow liquid with a sharp odor and amounts to about 130 g. The crude acid is purified by distillation through a 30-in. Vigreux column, using a variable take-off, a reflux ratio of 3:1, and a pressure of 1 mm. A fore-run of approximately 30 g. of material distilling up to 122°/1 mm. is obtained. The main fraction which distils at 122–123°/1 mm. is pure δ-acetyl-n-valeric acid and amounts to 66–79 g. (46–55%). The pure acid is a colorless crystalline hygroscopic solid which melts (sealed capillary) at 34–35° and is miscible with water in all proportions. The literature records the melting point of δ-acetyl-n-valeric acid as ranging from 31° to 42°.2,3,4
A. 7,7-Dichlorobicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene.2 A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The system is flushed with nitrogen with a gas-inlet tube attached to the top of the condenser before 126 g. (1.123 moles) of potassium tert-butoxide and 1.2 l. of pentane are added. The stirred suspension is cooled to 0–5° with an ice bath and 90 g. (1.12 moles) of 1,4-cyclohexadiene is introduced rapidly through the dropping funnel; 135 g. (1.131 moles) of chloroform is then added dropwise over a period of 1.5–2 hours. The resulting mixture is stirred for an additional 30 minutes before 300 ml. of cold water is added to dissolve all of the precipitated salts. The organic phase is separated, and the aqueous phase is extracted with one 50-ml. portion of pentane. The extract is combined with the original pentane solution and dried over approximately 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the product is distilled through a 15-cm. Vigreux column, giving 69–72 g. (38–39%) of 7,7-dichlorobicyclo[4.1.0]hept-3-ene, b.p. 50–51° (0.8 mm.).
An 0.80-g (3.0 mmol) portion of the crude aminal above is dissolved in 8 mL of 4.5 N hydrochloric acid solution and heated to 100°C in a boiling water bath for 2.5 hr. The clear liquid reaction mixture is transferred to an evaporating dish and left to evaporate in a fume hood. The residue is dissolved in 2 mL of 2 N hydrochloric acid solution and the pH of the solution is adjusted to 7 by slow addition of 30% aqueous sodium hydroxide with swirling, at which time the whole mixture solidifies. The solid mixture is kept at −20°C overnight, followed by addition of 10 mL of water and stirring with a glass rod. The solids are collected by suction affording 0.38–0.41 g (63–69%) of the β-amino acid of ~85% purity as a slightly yellow crystalline solid, mp 235°C (dec); [α]D −4° (1 N HCl, c 1.86).
B. (1R,2r,3S)-3-Acetoxy-2-nitrocyclohexyl acetate. In a 1-L flask 52 g (0.323 mol) of the nitrodiol are suspended in 150 mL of acetic anhydride. Without cooling, 3–6 drops of concentrated sulfuric acid are added. After 1 hr 500 mL of ice/water is rapidly added and stirring is continued for 60 min. The resulting colorless crystals are filtered, washed with water, and air-dried. The product thus obtained, 75.6 g (95.6%) of colorless crystals, is pure by TLC (4 : 1 hexane/ethyl acetate) and NMR, and melts at 89–90°C.
The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature, and a saturated solution of potassium permanganate is added in an amount sufficient for a violet color to persist for about 1 minute before turning green. About 100–110 ml. is required. Manganese dioxide is removed by filtration, and the filtrate is extracted with methylene chloride to remove non-acidic organic material. The aqueous layer is acidified with 18% hydrochloric acid, whereupon a pale yellow or green oil separates as a bottom layer. The oil is removed, and the aqueous layer is washed with methylene chloride. The washings are added to the oil, and the combined product is dried with anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Methylene chloride is removed by distillation, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure through a 6-in. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling at 125–135° (0.9–1.5 mm.) amounts to 217–225 g. (79–82%) and is a colorless oil that crystallizes on standing or when seeded to give a solid with a melting point of approximately 35–45°. This fraction is redistilled through a 24-in. spinning-band column and gives 166–180 g. (60–65%) of colorless 4-methyl-4-nitrovaleric acid, b.p. 122–124°/0.70–0.90 mm., m.p. 45–46°.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a dropping funnel, a reflux condenser, and a special stirrer is placed 100 g. (2.5 moles) of sodium hydroxide and 300 cc. of anhydrous methyl alcohol. The stirred mixture is heated for one hour in an oil bath held at 120° in order to effect solution of most of the sodium hydroxide. Stirring and heating are continued while 100 g. (0.59 mole) of ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate is added over a period of two hours. The resulting mixture is heated for one hour longer with the bath temperature at 120°. It is then diluted with 600 cc. of water and the condenser is arranged for distillation. The methyl alcohol is removed by distillation until a thermometer immersed in the boiling solution reads 98–100°. The residual aqueous solution is vigorously stirred, and exactly 210 cc. of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is carefully added drop by drop from a dropping funnel. The hot acid solution is treated with 2–4 g. of Darco and is filtered through a heated Büchner funnel. The filtrate is cooled in an ice bath. The pimelic acid is collected on a Büchner funnel and is crystallized from 100 cc. of boiling water for each 45 g. of acid. After drying in the air the acid melts at 103.5–104° and weighs 65–73 g. The mother liquors from the hydrolysis and recrystallization are combined and evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The resulting solid is extracted with two 500-cc. portions of acetone. The acetone is distilled from a steam bath, and the residual crude pimelic acid is recrystallized from the minimum quantity of benzene, yielding an additional 10–12 g. of pure material. The total yield is 75–83 g. (80–88 per cent of the theoretical amount based on ethyl 2-ketohexahydrobenzoate; 47–54 per cent based on cyclohexanone).
(A) Preparation of sec.-Octyl Hydrogen Phthalate.—A mixture of 130 g. (1 mole) of sec.-octyl alcohol (p. 366) and 148 g. (1 mole) of phthalic anhydride is heated for twelve to fifteen hours in a flask surrounded by an oil bath at 110–115°. During the heating the mixture should be mechanically stirred or shaken occasionally to give a homogeneous liquid. The cooled reaction mixture is added to about 8 l. of water which contains 150 g. (1.4 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate. The solid material gradually goes into solution, and if the resulting solution is perfectly clear, dilute hydrochloric acid is added in slight excess, thus precipitating the sec.-octyl hydrogen phthalate as an oil which rapidly turns to a solid; if the alkaline solution is not clear, owing to the presence of methyl hexyl ketone in the original alcohol, it should be extracted with ether to remove the ketone before acidifying with hydrochloric acid.
A 250-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with stirring bar, thermometer, and pressure-equalizing dropping funnel (dried in an oven at 80°C, assembled while still hot), and the system is placed under argon. Via syringe, 7.45 g (7.16 mL, 0.1 mol) of propargyl chloride and 35 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether are added. The solution is stirred and cooled to −50 to −60°C with an alcohol–dry ice bath. Under gentle argon pressure, 72.4 mL of a 1.41 M solution of methyllithium in diethyl ether is added dropwise over ca. 20 min. Stirring is continued for 15 min and 18.9 g (0.2 mol) of methyl chloroformate is added through the dropping funnel over ca. 10 min. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm slowly (3–4 hr) to 0 to −5°C, during which time a fine precipitate appears. Water (40 mL) is added dropwise with efficient stirring; the ether layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted 2 times with ether. The combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and the ether is removed under reduced pressure with a rotary evaporator. The residual liquid is distilled in a simple distillation assembly under reduced pressure, affording 10.7–11.1 g (81–83%) of methyl 4-chloro-2-butynoate as a colorless liquid, bp 41°C (0.25 mm), n22D 1.4728.
The water separated from the nitromethane distillates is mixed with one-fourth of its weight of salt, and redistilled, yielding 10–12 cc. of nitromethane and about 100 cc. of water. This water on distillation gives 3–4 cc. of nitromethane and about 45 cc. of water.
One hundred and twenty-eight grams (1 mole) of barbituric acid is added in the course of about 25 minutes in portions approximating 15–20 g. The temperature of the mixture rises from about 25–30° at the beginning of the reaction to 50° and is held at that value until all the barbituric acid has been added. During the addition, alloxan monohydrate begins to crystallize. The temperature of the solution is held at 50° for 25–30 minutes after completion of the addition of barbituric acid. Then the reaction slurry, which contains the major amount of alloxan monohydrate in crystalline form, is cooled to 5–10° and filtered through a 5-in. Büchner funnel fitted with a piece of filter cloth. The product is washed while still on the funnel with cold glacial acetic acid until the washings are practically colorless. In order to effect rapid drying, the acetic acid is finally washed out of the filter cake by means of 100–200 ml. of ether. The yellow alloxan monohydrate weighs 120–125 g.

A. 1-(Phenylsulfonyl)-1,2-propadiene. In a 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 100-mL addition funnel, and a septum fitted with a nitrogen inlet, are placed 10.5 mL (0.18 mol) of propargyl alcohol, 30.1 mL (0.22 mol) of triethylamine, and 700 mL of dichloromethane. The flask is cooled with an ice-water bath and 26.0 g (0.18 mol) of phenylsulfenyl chloride in 50 mL of dichloromethane is added under a nitrogen atmosphere from the addition funnel. After the solution is warmed to room temperature and stirred for 3 hr, the mixture is washed with water (2 × 200-mL) and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting residue (ca. 37 g) is dissolved in 100 mL of acetic acid in a 500-mL, round-bottomed flask fitted with a magnetic stirring bar, an addition funnel, and a thermometer. The solution is heated to 95°C and then 40 mL of hydrogen peroxide (30–35%) is slowly added over a 20-min period maintaining the internal temperature in the flask below 95°C. The mixture is heated for an additional 10 hr, maintaining the external temperature at 95°C. After being cooled to 25°C, the mixture is poured into 200 mL of water, and extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL). The organic layer is washed with water (2 × 100 mL) followed by saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated to give 28.1 g (68%) of 1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1,2-propadiene as an oil, which is used in the next step,.
A 250-ml. three-necked flask provided with a stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer is charged with 80 g. (0.470 mole) of potassium ethyl malonate and 50 ml. of water. The mixture is cooled to 5° with an ice bath, and 40 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid is added over a 30-minute period while the temperature is maintained below 10°. The mixture is filtered with suction, and the precipitate of potassium chloride washed with 75 ml. of ether. The aqueous layer of the filtrate is separated and washed with three 50-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate; then most of the solvent is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the remainder under reduced pressure. Finally, the liquid residue of monoethyl malonate is dried at 50°/1 mm. for 1 hour. The yield is 58–62 g. (93–100%).
A 5-l. flat-bottomed flask, equipped with a long (80–90 cm.) widebore condenser, a separatory funnel, and a mechanical stirrer, is supported 10 cm. above an electric hot plate. Two grams of vanadium pentoxide, 450 g. (4.2 moles) of sodium chlorate, and 1 l. of water are placed in the flask; the stirrer is started, the mixture is heated to 70–75°, and about 5–10 cc. of 200 g. (2.06 moles) of furfural is added. As soon as a vigorous reaction starts the balance of the furfural is added rapidly enough to maintain it. The entire addition requires seventy to eighty minutes. Then the mixture is heated at 70–75°, with stirring, for ten to eleven hours and allowed to stand overnight at room temperature. The crude fumaric acid is filtered with suction and dried in the air. It weighs 155–170 g. (65–72 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a separatory funnel, is placed 24.3 g. (1 gram atom) of magnesium turnings. The magnesium is covered with 100 cc. of anhydrous ether, and 10 cc. (15 g., 0.07 mole) of α-bromonaphthalene (with a crystal or two of iodine) is added to start the reaction. A warm water bath (45° or higher) is placed under the flask until the reaction starts. The stirrer is started, and a solution of 192 g. (0.93 mole) of α-bromonaphthalene in 500 cc. of anhydrous ether is added to the magnesium at such a rate that the reaction is vigorous but not violent. The addition requires from one and one-half to three hours. The water bath is again placed under the flask, and stirring and refluxing are continued for one-half hour after the addition of the halide is complete. The Grignard reagent which collects as a heavy oil in the bottom of the flask is dissolved by the addition of 533 cc. of dry benzene.
A. Hexahydro-3-(hydroxymethyl)-8a-methyl-2-phenyl[2S,3S,8aR]-5-oxo-5H-oxazolo[3,2-a]pyridine (Bicyclic lactam). To a warm solution of (1S,2S)-(+)-2-amino-1-phenyl-1,3-propanediol (32.4 g, 194 mmol) in toluene (800 mL), 5-oxohexanoic acid (25 g, 912 mmol) is added with stirring. The stirred mixture is heated to reflux under argon with azeotropic removal of water for 18 hr. The reaction mixture is cooled, washed with 0.5 N hydrochloric acid (100 mL) and with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (50 mL), dried over magnesium sulfate, and evaporated to dryness. The residue is crystallized from methylene chloride/hexane in the cold. The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with cold ether to give 35.9–37.2 g (71–74% yield) of the bicyclic lactam in two crops.
An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a Friedrich condenser, and a nitrogen-inlet tube is flushed with nitrogen, and then charged with a suspension of lithium aluminum hydride (47.9 g, 1.26 mol) in 1200 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF). The mixture is cooled (10°C, ice bath) and L-valine (100 g, 0.85 mol) is added in portions over a 30-min period from a 200-mL round-bottomed flask connected to the reaction flask via a flexible plastic sleeve so as not to produce too vigorous an evolution of hydrogen. After the addition is complete, the plastic sleeve is replaced by a stopper, the ice bath is removed, and the reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and then refluxed for 16 hr. The reaction mixture is then cooled again (10°C, ice bath) and diluted with ethyl ether (1000 mL). The reaction is quenched over a 30-min period with water (47 mL) (Caution! See, aqueous 15% sodium hydroxide (47 mL, over 20 min), and water (141 mL, over 30 min). The solution is stirred for 30 min and the white precipitate is filtered. The filter cake is washed with ethyl ether (3 × 150 mL) and the organic filtrates are combined, dried with anhydrous sodium sulfate, and concentrated under reduced pressure. Distillation of the residue under vacuum affords L-valinol (63.9–65.7 g, 73–75%) as a clear liquid: bp 63–65°C (0.9 mm): [α]D20 + 14.6° (neat); nD20 1.455; IR (neat) cm1: 3300, 1590; 1H NMR (CDCl3) δ: 0.92 (d, 6 H), 2.38–2.74 (m, 4 H), 3.13–3.78 (m, 2 H).
B. 8,8-Dipropylbicyclo[4.2.0]octa-1,3,5-trien-7-one (3). An oven-dried 500-mL Schlenk flask equipped with a reflux condenser and a stirring bar (32 mm x 15 mm) is charged with Pd(OAc)2 (134.7 mg, 2.0 mol%), rac-BINAP (560.4 mg, 3.0 mol%), Cs2CO3 (11.73 g, 36.01 mmol, 1.2 equiv). The Schlenk flask is evacuated and back-filled with argon (this sequence was repeated three times over a period of 3 min). Under an argon atmosphere, the 1,4-dioxane (150 mL) solution of 2-(2-bromophenyl)-2-propylpentanal (2) (8.50 g, 30.01 mmol), is then added by syringe. The mixture is then placed in a pre-heated oil bath at 110 °C for 22 h under argon atmosphere, resulting in a black slurry. The mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature, diluted with EtOAc (3 x 50 mL) and filtered through a Celite(r) plug (19.4 g, 50 mL) eluting with additional EtOAc (2 x 30 mL). The filtrate is concentrated and purified by column chromatography on silica gel, obtaining 4.24 g (20.96 mmol, 70% yield) of the title compound as a yellow oil and).
A. 3,6-Dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole . In an oven dried, 1-L, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar and a rubber septum are placed 3,6-dibromocarbazole (10.0 g, 31.0 mmol) and sodium hydroxide pellets (1.2 g, 30.0 mmol) in 500 mL of dry acetone under an argon atmosphere. Diethyl sulfate (4.1 mL, 31.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 15 min to the stirred reaction mixture at room temperature. After the addition, the reaction is stirred for 8 hr at which time all solids are removed by filtration and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure to give a yellow solid. The residue is dissolved in ethyl acetate (200 mL) and successively washed with aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (3 × 75 mL), brine (3 × 75 mL) and water (3 × 75 mL). The organic layer is dried over sodium sulfate , filtered and the solvent removed under reduced pressure to give a pale yellow solid. Recrystallization from 95% ethanol (ca. 350 mL) gives 3,6-dibromo-9-ethylcarbazole (8.85 g, 81% yield) as white needles, mp 139-141°C (lit.2 mp 137-138°C). The filtrate is evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized to give additional product (0.24 g, 2% yield).
The precipitated succinimide is collected on a large Büchner funnel atop a 2-l. filter flask and is washed with six 50-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The lower organic layer in the filtrate is separated from the aqueous phase, which is extracted with two 25-ml. portions of methylene chloride. The organic layer and the extracts are combined, washed vigorously with 50 ml. of a 5% sodium hydroxide solution and three 80-ml. portions of water, and dried over 10 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate for several hours in a flask wrapped with aluminum foil.
Removal of solvent from the extracts leaves a residue that is purified by dry-column chromatography.4 The residue is dissolved in 40 ml. of acetone in a 300-ml., round-bottomed flask, 30 g. of silica gel is added, and the acetone is removed with a rotary evaporator. The resulting solid mixture is placed on top of 360 g. of dry silica gel packed in flexible nylon tubing, and the column is developed with 420 ml. of 10:1 (v/v) benzene–acetone. Approximately 150 ml. of solvent drips from the bottom of the column toward the end of development; this eluent is collected in 25-ml. fractions and checked for product by TLC. The column itself is then cut into 2-cm. sections, the silica gel in each section is eluted with three 25-ml. portions of ethyl acetate, and the eluent from each section is analyzed by TLC. Combination of all the product-containing fractions yields 1.2–1.5 g. (40–47%) of the benzylated compound as an oil, nD20 1.6083 and.
A rapid stream of dry acetylene is passed into approximately 1 l. of liquid ammonia in a 2-l. three-necked flask equipped with a gas inlet tube and a mechanical stirrer while 23 g. (1 gram atom) of sodium is added over a period of 30 minutes and. The flow of acetylene is then reduced, and 98 g. (1 mole) of cyclohexanone is added dropwise. When this addition, which requires about an hour, is completed, the reaction mixture is allowed to stand for about 20 hours to permit the evaporation of nearly all the ammonia.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a dropping funnel, mercury-sealed stirrer, and condenser, is placed 625 g. (3.2 moles) of n-butyl sulfite (p. 112). The condenser is connected to a gas absorption trap, and 217 g. (131 cc., 1.6 moles) of sulfuryl chloride is added over a period of thirty minutes, with rapid stirring and cooling with tap water. The dropping funnel is then replaced by a thermometer dipping into the liquid, and the flask is heated slowly, with stirring, until the refluxing of the butyl chloride becomes vigorous (about 100–110°). Sulfur dioxide is evolved copiously during this time. The condenser is replaced with a 40-cm. Vigreux column and downward condenser; the temperature is gradually raised to 130–135° and kept there until no more sulfur dioxide or butyl chloride distils. The heating and distillation require about two hours. The residue of crude n-butyl sulfate is cooled to room temperature, and 100 cc. of saturated sodium carbonate solution is added. The mixture is stirred for about ten minutes, poured into a separatory funnel, and let stand for thirty minutes to allow the layers to separate. The upper layer is dried with calcium chloride, at least overnight, and then allowed to stand over 15 g. of anhydrous sodium or potassium carbonate for a day, with occasional shaking. The product is filtered into a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a 25-cm. fractionating side arm, and distilled from an oil bath. The first distillation gives 250–280 g. (74–83 per cent of the calculated amount) of n-butyl sulfate, b.p. 110–114°/4 mm., which has a sharp odor. Redistillation gives a pure material with a slight ester odor, boiling at 109–111° at 4 mm., with only a small mechanical loss.
A. 2-tert-Butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine (1). To an oven-dried, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a nitrogen inlet with gas bubbler, magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, condenser, and a 250-mL dropping funnel, are added triphosgene (14.8 g, 0.05 mol), and anhydrous toluene (120 mL). The mixture is kept under argon and cooled to ≈10°C with the aid of an external ice bath. A solution of N,N,N',N'-tetramethylurea (18.0 mL, 0.15 mol) in dry toluene (50 mL) is slowly added to the mixture over 30 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature, and stirring of the mixture is continued for an additional hour. During this time a white precipitate forms. tert-Butylamine (47.3 mL, 0.45 mol) is slowly added to the mixture over 30 min. After the addition is complete, the mixture is heated under reflux for 5 hr and then cooled to room temperature. Anhydrous ether (200 mL) is added and the white precipitate is quickly removed by filtration. The precipitate is washed with a further quantity of anhydrous ether (300 mL) and immediately dissolved in aqueous 25% sodium hydroxide solution (100 mL). The mixture is then extracted with three portions of ether (300 mL). The combined organic layers are dried (potassium carbonate), filtered, and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The resulting colorless liquid is purified by distillation (bp 88–89°C/36 mm) to afford 18.7 g (73%) of 2-tert-butyl-1,1,3,3-tetramethylguanidine 1.
The water solution containing the sodium 2-furancarboxylate is made acid to Congo red paper with 40 per cent sulfuric acid. This requires about 400 cc. On cooling, the 2-furancarboxylic acid crystallizes and is filtered with suction. The crude acid contains considerable sodium hydrogen sulfate and is deeply colored. For purification it is dissolved in 2300 cc. of boiling water containing about 60 g. of decolorizing carbon (Norite) and the solution is boiled for about forty-five minutes. It is then filtered and cooled with stirring to 16–20° and the 2-furancarboxylic acid which crystallizes is filtered by suction. The product thus obtained is light yellow in color but darkens somewhat on standing. The yield is 360–380 g. (60–63 per cent of the theoretical amount). This acid melts at 121–124° and by titration is 93–95 per cent pure. It is pure enough for many purposes.
C. 5α,6β-Dibromocholestan-3-one. The moist dibromide from 150 g. of cholesterol (part A) is suspended in 2 l. of acetic acid in a 5-l. round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer and mounted over a bucket of ice and water that later can be raised to immerse the flask. The suspension is stirred at room temperature (25–30°), and a solution, preheated to 90°, of 80 g. (2 oxygen equivalents) of sodium dichromate dihydrate in 2 l. of acetic acid is poured in through a funnel. The mixture reaches a temperature of 55–58° during the oxidation, and all the solid dissolves in 3–5 minutes. After another 2 minutes the ice bucket is raised until the flask is immersed; stirring is then stopped, and the mixture is allowed to stand in the ice bath without disturbance for 10 minutes to allow the dibromoketone to separate in easily filterable crystals. With stirring resumed, the temperature is brought to 25° and then, after addition of 400 ml. of water, to 15°. The product is collected on a 21-cm. Büchner funnel, and the filter cake is drained until the flow of filtrate amounts to no more than 25 drops per minute. The suction is released, the walls of the funnel are washed down with methanol, and 200 ml. of methanol is added. After a few minutes' standing, suction is applied and the crystals are drained thoroughly of solvent before they are washed in the same way with 200 ml. of fresh methanol. The last drops of filtrate should be completely colorless. Dried to constant weight at room temperature in a dark cupboard, the dibromoketone consists of shiny white crystals, m.p. 73–75° (dec.), [α]D25 −47° chloroform (c = 2.11); yield about 171 g. (96% in the oxidation or 81% from cholesterol).

(0.0501 mole) of indole in 600 ml. of chloroform is placed in a 2-l., three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The reaction mixture is stirred vigorously as a solution of 25 ml. (about 0.2 mole) of boron trifluoride diethyl etherate in 50 ml. of chloroform is added over 10 minutes. An orange–brown, resinous precipitate forms as the slightly exothermic reaction proceeds. After an additional 10 minutes of stirring, a solution of 5.86 g. (0.0501 mole) of indole in 50 ml. of chloroform is added in one portion.
The initial ca. 900 mL of the eluent is discarded. Concentration of the later fractions (ca. 1.3 L) under reduced pressure yields the pure product as an oil. The total yield is 12.2–12.8 g (70–74%).
The yield of β-ethoxypropionaldehyde is 22–24 g. (7–8%) and of β-ethoxypropionaldehyde acetal is 166–193 g. (31–39%), nD20 1.4067, d415 0.898.
C. (S)-[1-(Hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-2-methylpropyl]carbamic acid, tert-butyl ester(2). The Grignard solution obtained in Step B is cooled with an ice bath and a solution of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-valine methyl ester (1) (69.4 g, 0.30 mol) in THF (300 mL) is added at a rate to maintain the internal temperature below 6°C. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stirring is continued for another 15 hr.
An additional yield of amide is obtained by evaporating the original mother liquor to dryness under reduced pressure while heating the flask in a boiling water bath. The damp, brownish residue in the flask is dissolved in 100 cc. of hot alcohol. The hot solution is shaken a few minutes with decolorizing charcoal, filtered by suction while still hot, and then cooled in ice. Forty-six to fifty-eight grams of yellowish amide is deposited. One more crystallization with charcoal yields 44–56 g. of pure product.
A. Bis(3-dimethylaminopropyl)phenylphosphine. A 3-l. separatory funnel is charged with 395 g. (2.50 moles) of 3-chloro-N,N-dimethyl-1-propylamine hydrochloride, and a cold solution of 179 g. of potassium hydroxide in 540 ml. of water is added. The mixture is extracted three times with 300-ml portions of 5:1 diethyl ether-dichloromethane. The organic extracts are washed with 300 ml. of aqueous 2 N potassium hydroxide, combined, and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed by distillation through a 25-cm. Vigreux column at atmospheric pressure, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a 13-cm. Vigreux column, giving 263–276 g. (87–91%) of 3-chloro-N,N-dimethyl-1-propylamine as a colorless liquid, b.p. 72–73° (100 mm.) and, which is used immediately in the Grignard reaction.
The flask is placed in an ice-salt mixture, and the contents are decomposed by the gradual addition of 300 cc. of saturated ammonium chloride solution and 100 cc. of water. The aqueous layer is removed by means of a 1.5-l. separatory funnel, and sufficient ether is added to dissolve the yellow precipitate. The total volume of ether solution is about 1 l. This is washed with two 200-cc. portions of water, and the three aqueous layers are extracted consecutively with a 100-cc. portion of ether. The combined ether solution is dried over 30 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated on the steam bath to a volume of about 200 cc., and cooled to room temperature. The product which crystallizes is collected with suction and washed with two 25-cc. portions of ether. The yield is 35–38 g. of light yellow product, m.p. 122–123°. The ether is completely removed from the combined filtrates by heating on the steam bath, and the black oil is allowed to stand overnight. The semi-solid mass is filtered with suction and washed with a minimum amount of cold ether. In this way an additional 6–7 g. of yellow material is obtained which melts at 119–121°.
A. N-t-butylbenzaldimine. A 1-l. three-necked flask equipped with stirrer, thermometer, and condenser for downward distillation is charged with 109.5 g. (1.5 moles) of t-butylamine. Benzaldehyde (106 g., 1.0 mole) is then added in four increments to the stirred solution over a 20-minute period. A mild exotherm is noted which raises the temperature to 40–50°. Benzene (150 ml.) is then added and the solution is heated until distillation commences. Solvent (a mixture of amine, water, and benzene) is removed by distillation until a pot temperature of 110° is reached. The product mixture is then cooled to room temperature, dried over magnesium sulfate, and stripped free of solvent at aspirator pressure. Distillation of the yellow liquid so obtained yields 120–151 g. (78–94%) of colorless N-t-butylbenzaldimine, b.p. 59–63° (1 mm.), n26D 1.5174, n20D.
In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask, provided with a mechanical stirrer, a thermometer, and a dropping funnel, are placed 49 g. (0.5 mole) of cyclohexanone, 125 g. (0.58 mole) of p-tolylsulfonylmethylnitrosamide (p. 943), 150 ml. of 95% ethanol, and 10 ml. of water. The nitroso compound is largely undissolved. The stirrer is adjusted so that only the upper portion of solution is stirred and the precipitate moves slightly. The thermometer bulb is placed in the liquid.
The moist tribromoaniline, together with 2.1 l. of 95 per cent alcohol and 525 cc. of benzene, is placed in a 5-l. two-necked flask. One neck of the flask bears a reflux condenser; the other is closed with a stopper that can be removed momentarily for the addition of reagents. The tribromoaniline is brought into solution by heating the flask on a steam bath. To this solution is added 140 cc. of concentrated sulfuric acid, and then 140 g. (2.03 moles) of powdered sodium nitrite as rapidly as the violence of the reaction will permit. When the reaction has moderated, the solution is brought to boiling and maintained there as long as gas is evolved. It is then allowed to stand in a warm place for three hours more.
A mixture of 132 g. (1.0 mole) of 4,4-dimethoxy-2-butanone, 174 g. (1.6 moles) of methyl chloroacetate, and 800 ml. of dry ether is placed in the reaction flask, then 86 g. (1.6 moles) of sodium methoxide is placed in the addition flask. The solution is cooled in an ice-salt bath to −10°, then the sodium methoxide is added gradually at a rate such that a temperature below −5° can be maintained (about 2 hours). The mixture is stirred for an additional 2 hours and then allowed to come to room temperature overnight. It is cooled again to 0° and made slightly acidic by the addition of a solution of 10 ml. of glacial acetic acid in 150 ml. of water. The ether is decanted, and the residual slurry is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether solutions are washed in a separatory funnel with 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution to which is added 1-g. portions of sodium bicarbonate until the washings are no longer acidic. After each bicarbonate addition, the mixture is shaken for at least 1 minute before a test for acidity is made. Finally, the ether phase is washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, then dried over 20–25 g. of anhydrous magnesium sulfate. Distillation of the solvent leaves a nearly quantitative yield of crude glycidic ester.
The resulting solid is placed in a 500-mL Erlenmeyer flask and dissolved in a mixture of 250 mL of CHCl3 and 25 mL of CH3OH. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate (ca. 8–10 g) is added and the resulting suspension is stirred magnetically for 5 min. Filtration of this suspension through a Celite mat on a sintered-glass funnel, followed by evaporation of the solvent, affords (after drying under reduced pressure) 20.3–22 g (75–81.2%) of almost pure cis-2-(p-toluenesulfonamido)cyclohexanol, mp 155–157°C. The oxyaminated product may be purified further by washing with toluene to give 20–21.8 g (74.3–80.9%); mp 157–158°C.
C. 5-Methyl-2,2'-bipyridine (3). The 4- and 6-methyl-2,2'-bipyridines may also be prepared using the following procedure. A 500-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirrer is placed in a dry ice/acetone bath (−78°C), then 80 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and tert-butyllithium (tert-BuLi) (1.75 M in pentane, 52 mL, 91.0 mmol) are added to it, followed by dropwise addition of 2-bromopyridine (7.13 g, 4.3 mL, 45.1 mmol). The canary yellow THF solution becomes reddish-brown upon addition of the pyridyl bromide. After the solution is stirred at −78°C for 30 min, anhydrous zinc chloride (ZnCl2) (13.3 g, 97.4 mmol) is added, and the reaction is stirred at 25°C for 2 hr. The 5-methylpyridyl triflate (2) (8.95 g, 37.1 mmol) , lithium choride (LiCl) (3.18 g, 75.2 mmol), and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium (Pd(PPh3)4) (1.75 g, 1.5 mmol) are then added. The brownish-yellow reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 18 hr. After the solution is cooled, an aqueous solution of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (55 g, 148 mmol in 400 mL) is added and the pH is adjusted to ≈8 with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The solution is stirred for 15 min then poured into a separatory funnel. The product is extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 200 mL). The combined organic fractions are dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 , filtered, and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Flash chromatography on 275 g of deactivated silica gel ( 20% EtOAc:80% hexanes) affords 5.94 g (94%) of 5-methyl-2,2'-bipyridine as a very pale yellow oil.
B. 4-Acetylpyridine oxime tosylate. Pure E-oxime (27.1 g, 0.20 mol) and p-toluenesulfonyl chloride (47.9 g, 0.22 mol) are added to 100 mL of anhydrous pyridine in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask fitted with a drying tube and a large magnetic stirring bar. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25°C for 24 hr; a precipitate of pyridine hydrochloride forms. A 500-mL portion of ice water is added with continued stirring. the initial precipitate dissolves, and a voluminous white precipitate soon forms. This is collected by suction filtration, washed with three 150-mL portions of cold water and dried under reduced pressure and over Drierite to constant weight. The yield of pure tosylate, mp 79–81°C, is 55.1 g (95%).
B. 4-Cyanophenylzinc bromide . A dry, 250-mL, three-necked flask equipped with an argon inlet and a stirring bar is charged with 4-bromobenzonitrile (9.1 g, 50 mmol) and evacuated for 5 min. The flask is flushed with argon, dry tetrahydrofuran (THF, 100 mL) is added, and the flask is equipped with an internal thermometer. The solution is cooled to −100°C in a diethyl ether/liquid nitrogen bath and left for 5 min before slowly adding butyllithium (BuLi, 32 mL, 1.56 M in hexanes, 50 mmol) (approx. 20 min). After complete addition the mixture is stirred at −100°C for an additional 30 min before it is allowed to warm to −78°C. At this temperature, a solution of zinc bromide (ZnBr2, 36.6 mL, 1.5 M in THF, 55 mmol) is slowly added (approx. 20 min). After complete addition, the reaction mixture is kept at −78°C for 5 min, then the flask is warmed with an ice bath to 0°C and left for 10 min at this temperature before allowing it to warm to room temperature. The yield of the zinc reagent is checked by hydrolysis and iodolysis before concentrating it under reduced pressure to 2.0-2.2 M (22-25 mL).
A 5-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer and a reflux condenser bearing a calcium chloride tube. A solution of 400 g. (2.56 moles) of l-menthol (crystals, m.p. 41–42°) in 1 l. of dry toluene is placed in the flask, and to it is added 70 g. (3.04 gram atoms) of clean sodium. The third neck of the flask is then tightly closed with a cork stopper, and the flask is heated in an oil bath until the toluene refluxes gently. As soon as the sodium has melted, stirring is begun and is maintained at such a rate that the sodium is broken into fine globules.
(A) Ethoxyacetic Acid.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, provided with a reflux condenser 70 to 80 cm. long, is placed 1250 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol. Through the condenser tube 69 g. (3 gram atoms) of metallic sodium is added rapidly enough to keep the alcohol refluxing gently. When the sodium has completely dissolved, a solution of 142 g. (1.5 moles) of chloroacetic acid in 180 cc. of absolute alcohol is added slowly in 20-cc. portions to the sodium ethoxide solution. After all the acid has been added, the mixture is heated gently for ten minutes. The excess alcohol is removed as completely as possible by distilling from a steam bath and finally by passing steam into the residue. The aqueous solution is cooled, and 140 cc. (1.7 moles) of concentrated hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added. The sodium chloride is removed by filtration with suction and is washed with two 50-cc. portions of ether. The original filtrate is saturated with dry sodium sulfate (30–35 g.) and is then extracted with the ether which was used for washing the precipitate, together with an additional 100 cc. of ether. The ether is separated from the aqueous layer, and the latter is extracted four times with 100-cc. portions of fresh ether. The ether is removed by distillation from a steam bath, and the residue is distilled under reduced pressure, using a 500-cc. Claisen flask equipped with a 500-cc. receiver. The acid boils at 109–111°/17–18 mm. and weighs 115–116 g. (74 per cent of the theoretical amount). By redistilling the low-boiling fraction and collecting the portion boiling at 150–210°, there is obtained an additional 7–10 g. of material which is chiefly ethoxyacetic acid and may be combined with the main fraction for conversion to the ester.
When the alcohol is saturated with hydrogen chloride, the generator is disconnected and the stem of the separatory funnel is connected to the inlet tube by a rubber tube provided with a screw clamp for adjusting the flow. The acrolein is added, with stirring, to the alcoholic hydrogen chloride solution at about 0°. The addition should require from one to two hours. After two layers have formed, the lower layer of acetal is separated and treated gradually with powdered sodium bicarbonate until all acid is neutralized. The mixture is filtered. The filtrate is washed with two 50-cc. portions of ice water and dried over 10 g. of potassium carbonate for five to ten hours. It is then filtered and distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of product boiling at 58–62°/8 mm. is 112 g. (34 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. 3-n-Heptylureidomethylenemalononitrile. In a 250-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a heating mantle and a reflux condenser are placed 28.5 g. (0.18 mole) of N-n-heptylurea, 11.9 g. (0.18 mole) of malononitrile, and 26.7 g. (0.18 mole) of triethyl orthoformate. The mixture is heated under reflux for 2 hours and then cooled in ice. The solid product is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel. The filtrate is concentrated on the steam bath to incipient crystallization, cooled, and filtered. The two lots of tan solid, 41–42 g., thus obtained are dissolved in 75 ml. of 75% ethyl alcohol in a 250-ml. beaker, 2 g. of decolorizing carbon is added, and the mixture is boiled for 2–3 minutes with constant stirring (necessary to avoid vigorous bumping). The hot solution is filtered by gravity into a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask through fluted filter paper. The flask is stoppered and cooled in the refrigerator for 4 hours. The solid product is collected by suction filtration on a Büchner funnel and washed four times with 10-ml. portions of distilled water. The white crystalline 3-n-heptylureidomethylenemalononitrile is dried at 50° in a vacuum oven. It melts at 130–132° and amounts to 33.8–34.8 g. (80–83%).
To the solution of the alkoxide enolate thus prepared is added by syringe within 5 min 10.7 mL (124 mmol) of neat 3-bromo-1-propene at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not rise above −70°C. Stirring is continued, first for 2 hr at −75°C, and then overnight while the temperature rises to −5°C.
A 3-l. long-necked Pyrex flask containing 880 g. (620 cc., 10 moles) of concentrated nitric acid (sp. gr. 1.42) is supported in an ice bath in a hood and supplied with a mechanical stirrer and a thermometer suspended in the liquid. While the temperature is kept between 25° and 30° by means of the ice bath, 200 g. (2.12 moles) of trimethylene chlorohydrin (p. 533) is run in from a dropping funnel. The addition takes two to three hours. Stirring is continued for a half hour longer.
In a 500-ml. flask, to which is attached an air condenser whose open end is protected by absorbent cotton or calcium chloride in a drying tube, are mixed 119 g. (0.75 mole) of 4-methylcarbostyril (p. 580) and 138 g. (82.5 ml., 0.9 mole) of freshly distilled phosphorus oxychloride. The mixture is maintained at 80–85° in a water bath for about 15 minutes until most of the solid has dissolved, and then it is warmed carefully for an additional 15 minutes on a wire gauze until solution is complete. The hot reaction mixture is poured into 1 l. of water containing 1 kg. of cracked ice.
To the cooled residue of sodium enolate is added 600 g. (570 ml., 4 moles) of ethyl benzoate. The steam bath is replaced by an oil bath, and the temperature of the bath is raised to 140–150° and maintained there for 6 hours. Then, over a period of another hour, the temperature of the bath is gradually raised to 180°. The distillate that is collected during this period of heating amounts to 200–210 g. and consists chiefly of ethyl acetate and ethanol.
The crude benzotriazole is placed in a 200-ml. modified Claisen flask and distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of white solid (yellow cast) boiling at 201–204° at 15 mm. or 156–159° at 2 mm. is 92–99 g. The product in the receiver is melted over a luminous flame and poured into 250 ml. of benzene. The clear solution is stirred until crystallization sets in; after being chilled for 2 hours, the product is filtered on a Büchner funnel. The colorless benzotriazole weighs 90–97 g. (75–81%) and melts at 96–97°.
Thirty-four grams (0.25 mole) of p-nitroaniline is dissolved in 110 cc. of fluoboric acid solution in a 400-cc. beaker. The beaker is placed in an ice bath and the solution stirred with an efficient stirrer. A cold solution of 17 g. (0.25 mole) of sodium nitrite in 34 cc. of water is added dropwise. When the addition is complete, the mixture is stirred for a few minutes and filtered by suction on a sintered glass filter. The solid diazonium fluoborate is washed once with 25–30 cc. of cold fluoboric acid, twice with 95 per cent alcohol, and several times with ether. The product weighs 56–59 g. (95–99 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. (Phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2). A 100-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with an argon inlet adapter and a magnetic stir bar is charged with 12.9 g (40.0 mmol) of finely ground (diacetoxyiodo)benzene and 70 mL of dichloromethane. The suspension is cooled at 0°C with an ice bath and 6.9 mL (78 mmol) of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid is added in one portion by syringe. The resulting clear yellow solution is stirred at room temperature for 2 hr and a solution of 8.9 mL (40.0 mmol) of 1,2-bis(trimethylsilyl)benzene in 10 mL of dichloromethane is added dropwise by syringe. The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hr, and the solvent is removed by rotary evaporation under reduced pressure to afford the product as colorless crystals. (When an oily residue is obtained, it can be crystallized by triturating with diethyl ether.) The crystals are collected by filtration and washed with 40 mL of diethyl ether to afford 14.7-15.7 g (73-78%) of (phenyl)[2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl]iodonium triflate (2) as colorless needles, mp 142-143°C.
The flask is warmed in a water bath until the appearance of a sudden exothermic reaction, at which point the flask must be cooled at once by rotating it underneath the surface of cold water. The cooling is continued until the thermometer indicates a temperature of 125° or less. The flask is then immersed in a bath of boiling water for about three hours, after which the mixture is cooled to about 50°, and poured slowly into 2.5 l. of warm dilute hydrochloric acid, made from 325 cc. (about 4 moles) of concentrated acid, contained in a large crock of about 15 l. (4 gal.) capacity. The mixture is left for about three hours until hydrolysis is complete.
An oven-dried 250-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum and a water condenser provided with an argon atmosphere inlet, is charged with Schwartz's reagent (9.36 g, 36.3 mmol) by temporarily removing the septum. The flask is immersed in an ice/water cooling bath equipped with an external thermometer, and placed on a magnetic stir plate. Under an atmosphere of argon, 25.0 mL of tetrahydrofuran and 1-hexyne (3.71 mL, 33.0 mmol) are added to the flask by syringe through the septum. After stirring for 5 min, the ice/water cooling bath is replaced by an oil bath equipped with an external thermometer. Stirring is maintained and the reaction flask is heated to 40 °C for 6 h. The resulting yellow solution is cooled to room temperature, trans–4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one (4.82 g, 33.0 mmol) is added and 5 min later copper(I) iodide-dimethyl sulfide complex (782 mg, 3.30 mmol) is added by temporarily removing the septum. The reaction temperature is increased to 40 °C, and the stirring is continued under an argon atmosphere for 12 h. The heating is interrupted and the oil bath is replaced by an ice/water bath. After removing the argon inlet and the water condenser, the reaction mixture is quenched with ether saturated with water (50 mL) at the ice/water bath temperature. The resulting heterogeneous mixture is stirred for 10 min and filtered in vacuo through a Celite® pad in a Büchner funnel. The Celite is carefully washed with 3 × 100 mL portions of ether, and the resulting ethereal phase is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel. The organic layer is washed with 2 × 20 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered through a second Celite pad in a Büchner funnel, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product is purified on a silica gel 60Å chromatography column (38 cm × 4 cm) using a hexanes-ethyl acetate 1:0–10:1 gradient. Removal of the eluent in vacuo afforded 5.55 g (24.1 mmol, 73%) of 4-phenyl-5(E)-decen-2-one as a light yellow oil.
A. (Z)-2,3-Dibromo-2-propenoic acid ethyl ester.2 Ethyl propiolate (9.01 g, 91.8 mmol) and carbon tetrachloride (75 mL) are added in sequence to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is fitted with a 30-mL, pressure-equalizing addition funnel to which elemental bromine (5.00 mL, 97.0 mmol) is added by transfer pipette. The flask is partially immersed in an oil bath heated to 70°C. After 10 min for temperature equilibration, dropwise addition of bromine is initiated and completed within 10 min. Complete bromine transfer is achieved by rinsing the addition funnel with a 5-mL portion of carbon tetrachloride. The red-brown solution is heated at 70°C for 30 min, allowed to cool to ambient temperature, and carbon tetrachloride and excess bromine are removed by rotary evaporation. The pale yellow concentrate is applied to the top of a short column of flash-grade silica gel (150 g, 7-cm diam × 10 cm) loaded with 5% ethyl acetate-hexanes solution; the product dibromide elutes rapidly with this solvent system (< 1 L total solvent volume, 150-mL fractions,). Fractions containing the dibromide (Rf = 0.66, 5% ethyl acetate-hexanes) are combined and concentrated. The last traces of solvent are removed at 1 mm (0.5 hr) to afford (Z)-2,3-dibromo-2-propenoic acid ethyl ester (21.5–22.0 g, 91–93%) as a colorless liquid,.
Further purification is achieved by the following procedure. The chloroacetate from above is dissolved in 150 mL of ether. This solution is stirred together with a 10-mL aqueous solution saturated with sodium borohydride. The stirring is continued until the yellow color of the organic phase disappears (ca. 15 min). The organic phase is separated and washed with 5 mL of 2 M sodium hydroxide solution and 5 mL of a saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distilling off the solvent at atmospheric pressure. The solvent that remains is removed with a rotary evaporator to afford 9.5–10.5 g (64–70%) of chloroacetate, with the same composition as above, but which is now completely free from 5,8-dihydronaphthoquinone.
In a 1-l. beaker are placed 108 g. (1 mole) of o-phenylenediamine, 120 g. (115 ml., 2 moles) of glacial acetic acid, and 300 ml. of water. By warming the mixture slightly a clear solution is obtained. The beaker is placed in ice water, and the contents are cooled to 5°. As soon as this temperature is reached, a cold solution of 75 g. (1.09 moles) of sodium nitrite in 120 ml. of water is added all at once, the mixture being stirred with a glass rod or by a slow mechanical stirrer. The reaction mixture turns dark green, and the temperature rises rapidly to 70–80°. The color of the solution changes to a clear orange-red. The beaker is now removed from the cooling bath, and the contents are allowed to stand for 1 hour; as the solution cools, the benzotriazole separates as an oil. The beaker is then packed in ice, and the mixture is stirred until it sets to a solid mass. After being kept cold for 3 hours, the solid is collected on a Büchner funnel, washed with 200 ml. of ice water, and sucked as dry as possible under a rubber dam. The tan-colored product, after drying at 45–50° overnight, weighs 110–116 g.
In a 2-l. three-necked flask, fitted with a mercury-sealed stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel, is placed 500 cc. of absolute ethyl alcohol, and 23 g. (1 gram atom) of cleanly cut sodium is added in portions. When the sodium has dissolved the solution is cooled to 60°, and 146 g. (1 mole) of ethyl oxalate is added in a rapid stream through the funnel with vigorous stirring. This is washed down with a small quantity of absolute alcohol and is followed immediately by the addition of 175 g. (1.06 moles) of ethyl phenylacetate. Stirring is discontinued at once, the reaction flask is lowered from the stirrer, and a 2-l. beaker is made ready. Within four to six minutes after the ethyl phenylacetate has been added crystallization sets in. The contents of the flask are transferred immediately to the beaker at the first sign of crystallization, which is nearly instantaneous.
In a 2-l. three-necked round-bottomed flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and dropping funnel, are placed 30 g. of pure 2-nitrofluorene, m.p. 157° [Org. Syntheses, Coll. Vol. 2, 447 (1943)], and 250 ml. of 95% ethanol. After warming to 50° on a steam bath, 0.1 g. of palladized charcoal catalyst (previously moistened with alcohol) is added and the stirrer is started. About 15 ml. of hydrazine hydrate is added from the dropping funnel during 30 minutes. At this point an additional 0.1 g. of catalyst (previously moistened with alcohol) is added and the mixture is heated until the alcohol refluxes gently. After 1 hour the nitrofluorene has dissolved completely and the supernatant liquor is almost colorless.
A. 1-(2-Fluoro-4-iodophenyl)-2,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole . A 500-mL, single-necked, round-bottomed flask with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with 2-fluoro-4-iodoaniline (50.0 g, 211 mmol), p-toluenesulfonic acid (0.40 g, 2.1 mmol), 250 mL of toluene, and acetonylacetone(29.7 mL, 253 mmol). A Dean-Stark trap is attached to the flask, and the solution is warmed to reflux for 1 hr. After the solution is cooled to room temperature, it is transferred to a 500-mL separatory funnel, and washed with one 50-mL portion of aqueous saturated sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), five 50-mL portions of water, and one 50-mL portion of brine. The organic phase is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated to provide a brown, free-flowing solid (67.5 g, 101.5% of theory).
The product is dried in air and then at 100°. The total yield is 118–123 g. (72–75%) of a white or nearly white product which decomposes at 237–240° cor.; this material is pure enough for most purposes. It may be recrystallized from 95% ethanol (about 30 ml. per gram) or from dioxane (about 10 ml. per gram). The former solvent permits the higher recovery (89–90%) and, except for the large volume required, is to be preferred. The mother liquor may be used for recrystallization of several successive lots of isatoic anhydride. The purified compound decomposes at 243° cor..
B. (S)-1-Chloro-3-(Boc-amino)-4-phenyl-2-butanone (3). A 500-mL three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a stir bar, a nitrogen inlet, a reflux condenser capped with a nitrogen outlet, and a rubber septum through which is inserted a temperature probe. The flask is flushed with nitrogen for 5 min and is then charged with dimethylsulfoxonium (S)-2-oxo-3-(Boc-amino)-4-phenylbutylide (2) (13.6 g, 40 mmol), which is added through temporary removal of the reflux condenser. Anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (250 mL) is added by syringe through a septum. A 4.0 M solution of hydrogen chloride in 1,4-dioxane, (11.6 mL, 46.0 mmol) is added via syringe through the septum over 5 min at room temperature during which time a solid sulfoxonium salt separates. The mixture is then heated with stirring at reflux (70 °C) for 4 h. The reaction mixture stirs as a very thick slurry for the first 30 min of this period. After cooling to room temperature, the resulting homogeneous solution is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel, to which is added 100 mL of ethyl acetate and 200 mL of hexanes. The mixture is washed with two 200-mL portions of water, one 100-mL portion of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, four 200-mL portions of water and one 100-mL portion of brine. The solution is dried over sodium sulfate and filtered through a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel. The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (25 °C, 20 mmHg) to obtain 13–14 g of a light yellow solid. This material is dissolved in 40 mL of hot hexanes (70 °C). Upon cooling, a solid separates which is collected by filtration on a 100-mL fritted-glass Büchner funnel and dried overnight at 25 °C and 0.5 mmHg to afford 3 (9.61–9.71 g, 81% yield) as an off-white solid.
A. Potassium 1-Naphthyltrifluoroborate (2). A 1-L round-bottomed flask equipped with a 4-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar and a thermocouple thermometer is charged with 1-naphthaleneboronic acid (22.0 g, 128 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and methanol (80 mL). The solution is cooled to 5 ºC using an ice-bath. A solution of KHF2 (30.3 g dissolved in 100 mL water, 388 mmol, 3.0 equiv) is added in 5 portions over 10 min, resulting in a thick white slurry. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred for 20 min. The stir bar is removed and the mixture is concentrated by rotary evaporation (45 ºC bath temp, 100 to 20 mmHg). Acetonitrile (2 x 200 mL) flushes are used to azeotropically remove the remaining water, with the mixture concentrated by rotary evaporation after each flush (45 ºC bath temp, 100 to 20 mmHg). The flask is equipped with a 3-cm oval PTFE-coated magnetic stir bar and acetonitrile (300 mL) is added. The flask is placed in a heating mantle and the stirred mixture is heated at reflux for 90 min. After cooling to ambient temperature over 90 min, the resulting solids are removed by filtration through a 150-mL medium porosity sintered glass funnel and rinsed with acetonitrile (2 x 50 mL). The filtrate is concentrated by rotary evaporation (55 ºC bath temp, 70 mmHg) to afford potassium 1-naphthyltrifluoroborate (2) as a white solid (29.9 g) as a hemi-acetonitrile solvate. The solid is heated under vacuum (70 mmHg) for 18-24 h at 90 ºC to provide the de-solvated product (26.5 g, 89% yield).
A. trans-3-(Phenylsulfonyl)-4-(chloromercuri)cyclohexene. A 1-L, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a large magnetic stirring bar is charged with 32.6 g (120 mmol) of mercury(II) chloride, 24.6 g (150 mmol) of sodium benzenesulfinate, 80 mL of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 400 mL of water. The slurry is initially stirred at room temperature for 2 hr and then 10.6 g (132 mmol) of 1,3-cyclohexadiene is added dropwise under vigorous stirring at room temperature over a period of a few minutes. The reaction mixture is stirred for another 2 hr. The reaction flask is cooled with ice and the solid material collected by filtration using a Büchner funnel, washed with 400 mL of water, and dried in a desiccator over calcium chloride at reduced pressure (oil pump), to give 53.0 g (97%) of essentially pure trans-3-(phenylsulfonyl)-4-(chloromercuri)cyclohexene.
After cooling, the layers are separated, the organic layer is washed with dilute sodium bicarbonate solution and placed in a flask equipped for distillation, and the solvent is distilled The oily residue is transferred while still warm to a 1-l. Claisen flask, and the product is distilled under reduced pressure; b.p. 190–200°/2.5 mm. (168–170°/1 mm.). The yield is 400–430 g. (61–65%). The distilled ketone is recrystallized once from ethanol (1.5–2 l.) to yield 345–390 g. (52–59%) of 9-acetylphenanthrene of m.p. 73–74°.
To 375 cc. (4.3 moles) of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) and 200 g. of ice is added 139.6 g. (1.5 moles) of aniline. The resulting solution is diazotized with a solution of 103.5 g. (1.5 moles) of c.p. sodium nitrite, ice being added to the reaction mixture, as necessary, in order to keep the temperature below 5°. The final volume of the diazotized solution is about 1 l. This solution is added in a slow stream from a dropping funnel to the potassium selenide solution, which is vigorously stirred with a mechanical stirrer. When all the diazotized solution has been added, the red aqueous solution is decanted from the dark oil which forms and is heated to boiling. It is then poured back on the oil, the mixture is well stirred, 200 cc. of chloroform is added, and the selenium is collected on a filter and washed with a little more chloroform. After the chloroform layer is separated, the aqueous layer is again extracted with 200 cc. of chloroform. The combined extracts are then distilled, the diphenyl selenide being collected from 300 to 315°. The yield of yellow oil of rather unpleasant odor is 138–150 g. (79–86 per cent of the theoretical amount). If a purer product is desired, this material can be distilled under diminished pressure. It boils at 165–167°/12 mm.
B. 1-Methoxymethyl-1-phenylethane. The reaction flask containing a toluene solution of chloromethyl methyl ether (250 mmol, 1.5 equiv) prepared above is immersed in a cold water bath and the contents cooled to 5–10 °C. α-Phenethyl alcohol (20 mL, 166 mmol, 1 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added in one portion. Diisopropylethylamine (36.0 mL, 208 mmol, 1.25 equiv) is charged to the addition funnel and added to the reaction mixture dropwise over 30 min. The internal temperature of the mixture is maintained below 25 °C during and immediately after the amine addition, and once heat evolution has ceased, the reaction mixture is allowed to come to ambient temperature and then stirred for 12 h. At this time the starting material is consumed. The orange solution is diluted with ethyl acetate (100 mL) and a saturated aqueous NH4Cl solution (100 mL), and the biphasic mixture stirred vigorously for a minimum of five minutes to ensure all residual chloromethyl methyl ether is decomposed. The layers are separated and the resulting clear, colorless organic layer is washed once with water (100 mL), once with brine (100 mL), dried with MgSO4 and concentrated by rotary evaporation to a clear, colorless oil. The material is transferred to a 50-mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar and a short-path distillation head. The product is purified by distillation, collecting a single fraction (bp 60–63 °C, 0.5 mmHg) of 1-methoxymethoxy-1-phenylethane as a clear, colorless oil (26.2 g, 157 mmol, 95% yield).
The product is now mixed with 2 l. of distilled water at 35° in a 5-l. flask provided with a stirrer, and 15 per cent sodium hydroxide solution is dropped in with continuous stirring until a faint red color is just produced. Should this disappear, it is restored by the addition of a few drops more. When it has persisted for five minutes, the color is discharged by the addition of a few drops of acetic acid, and the insoluble unattacked trinitrotoluene filtered off and washed with a little water. The trinitrobenzoic acid is precipitated from the filtrate by the addition of a slight excess of 50 per cent sulfuric acid. The solution is chilled, and the acid filtered and washed free from salts with ice water. When dried in air it weighs 230–280 g. (57–69 per cent of the theoretical amount).
A. 1-Morpholinopropan-1-one. A flame-dried, 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, 50-mL addition funnel (capped with a rubber septum), a nitrogen inlet and Teflon-coated thermocouple is charged with 32.9 mL (32.9 g, 378 mmol, 1.1 equiv) of morpholine, which is added by syringe to the addition funnel with the stopcock open. Methylene chloride (175 mL) is added by syringe through the same septum and is used to rinse the addition funnel. The stopcock is closed and solution is placed under a positive pressure of nitrogen from a manifold. While stirring the solution, the flask and its contents are cooled in a NaCl/ice bath (internal temperature −8 °C). To the stirred solution is added propanoyl chloride (15.0 mL, 15.9 g, 172 mmol) through the addition funnel over 20 min. Following the addition, the mixture is allowed to warm to ambient temperature. The mixture is stirred for 23 h at ambient temperature. Then the solution is diluted with 70 mL of methylene chloride and transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel. The mixture is subsequently washed with 1N HCl (2 × 50 mL), and a mixture of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate (25 mL) and brine (50 mL) in a 1-L separatory funnel. The organic phase is dried over 10 g of anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered through glass wool, and concentrated by rotary evaporation (10 mmHg) to provide 27.4 g of a colorless liquid. The product is distilled with a short path distillation head (50 mm Vigreaux column) (oil bath temperature 110–120 °C) to afford 21.3 g (86%) of 1-morpholinopropan-1-one as a clear liquid (bp 83–86 °C, 1.1 mmHg).
(B) Arsenoacetic Acid.—A solution of 12.5 g. of sodium arsonoacetate and 30 g. of sodium hypophosphite (NaH2PO2 · H2O) in 150 cc. of cold 15 per cent sulfuric acid is allowed to stand at room temperature. After two or three days, the yellow precipitate is filtered off, washed with water, and dried in a vacuum over sulfuric acid or phosphorus pentoxide. A second crop is obtained by allowing the mother liquid to stand for two days longer.
B. Diphenaldehydic acid. A mixture of 10 g. (0.0368 mole) of 3,8-dimethoxy-4,5,6,7-dibenzo-1,2-dioxacycloöctane, 50 ml. of 10% sodium hydroxide solution, and 200 ml. of 95% ethyl alcohol is heated under reflux for 15 minutes, during which time the solid dissolves. The solution is cooled, acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid, and diluted to the cloud point with water. Crystallization is induced by rubbing the side of the vessel with a stirring rod. More water is then added slowly until crystallization is complete. Filtration yields 6.7–7.3 g. (81–88%) of colorless to yellowish crystals melting at 130–132°. Recrystallization from 100 ml. of 1:1 methanol-water gives an 80–95% recovery of diphenaldehydic acid melting at 134–135°,, and.
A piece of glass wool is placed on the star seal, and the combustion tube is filled with 74 g. (110 ml.) of 14- to 20-mesh silica gel. The tube is heated to 500°, and nitrogen is passed through the column for 30 minutes to activate the catalyst. Anhydrous ammonia is then passed through the column at a rate of 3.9 moles per hour. Molten azelaic acid, 100 g. (0.53 mole), is poured into the reservoir B, which is maintained at 108–112° by means of the electrically heated jacket, and allowed to drop onto the hot silica gel over a 4-hour period. After the azelaic acid has been added, ammonia is passed through the tube for an additional period of 30 minutes, with the temperature maintained at 500°, to complete the removal of product from the combustion tube.
B. Ethyl 1-cyano-2-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate. A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a heating mantle, a Teflon®-coated magnetic stirring bar, a 1-l. pressure-equalizing dropping funnel fitted with a Teflon® stopcock, a stopper, and a reflux condenser fitted with a nitrogen-inlet tube. The apparatus is flushed with nitrogen, and 200 ml. of freshly distilled cyclohexane and 0.30 g. (0.0012 mole) of benzoyl peroxide are added to the flask. While a static nitrogen atmosphere is maintained in the flask, a solution of 5.00 g. (0.0270 mole) of ethyl (E)-2-cyano-6-octenoate in 800 ml. of freshly distilled cyclohexane is added from the dropping funnel to the stirred, refluxing benzoyl peroxide solution over a period of 40 hours. Three additional 0.30-g. (0.0012-mole) portions of benzoyl peroxide (total: 1.2 g., 0.0050 mole,), are added at 12-hour intervals during the addition of the unsaturated ester. After the addition of the unsaturated ester and the benzoyl peroxide is complete, the reaction mixture is refluxed with stirring for an additional 20 hours. The resulting colorless to pale-yellow solution is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to approximately 200 ml., diluted with 250 ml. of ether, and washed with 100 ml. of aqueous saturated iron(II) sulfate to destroy any unchanged benzoyl peroxide. The organic layer is then washed successively with two 200-ml. portions of aqueous saturated sodium hydrogen carbonate and two 200-ml. portions of water and dried over anhydrous calcium chloride. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator, and the residual liquid is fractionally distilled under reduced pressure through a 5-cm. Vigreux column. After separation of a 0.16–0.25-g. (3–5%) forerun, b.p. 63–64° (0.2 mm.), nD25 1.4550–1.4560, containing primarily the cyclized product, 3.68–3.82 g. (74–76%) of colorless ethyl 1-cyano-2-methylcyclohexanecarboxylate is collected, b.p. 64–75° (0.2 mm.), nD25 1.4532–1.4539 and.
In a 5-l. flask, equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a separatory funnel, is placed 3 kg. of 75 per cent sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.67). The solution is heated to about 150°, the stirrer is started, and 1 kg. (8.54 moles) of o-tolunitrile (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 514) is added during two hours. The temperature is maintained at 150–160° and the mixture is stirred for two hours after the addition of the nitrile is complete. The temperature is then raised to 190° and stirring is continued for another hour. Usually some crystalline material appears in the condenser at this stage. The reaction mixture is cooled, poured into ice water, and filtered. The crude material is dissolved in an excess of 10 per cent sodium hydroxide solution, filtered hot, and the filtrate acidified with dilute sulfuric acid. The product is collected on a Büchner funnel, dried, and recrystallized from about 3 l. of benzene. The yield is 930–1030 g. (80–89 per cent of the theoretical amount) of o-toluic acid which melts at 102–103°.
A pot residue of 30–35 g. remains. The conversion of o-chloroaniline to 3-(o-chloroanilino) propionitrile is 50.5–53%, with a yield of 90–95% based on o-chloroaniline, and 53–65% based on acrylonitrile.
The material which is collected is redistilled through a 90-cm. vacuum-jacketed column packed with glass beads (5 mm.) using a 1:10 reflux ratio. The fraction, b.p. 80–100°, is redistilled through the same column to give 353–386 g. (77–84%) of dichloromethyl methyl ether, b.p. 82–85.5°, n20D 1.4303.
To 200 g. (1.64 moles) of benzoic acid in a 1-l. Kjeldahl flask, in the top of which is inserted a loosely fitting cold finger, is added 500 ml. of fuming sulfuric acid. The mixture is heated in an oil bath for 5 hours at 240–250° (bath temperature).
In a 2-gallon (8-l.) wide-mouthed bottle packed in ice-salt mixture are placed 630 g. (8.7 moles) of commercial (95 per cent) sodium nitrite and 5 kg. of chopped ice, and the mixture is well stirred. A cold (0–5°) solution of sodium bisulfite, made by saturating with sulfur dioxide a solution of 495 g. (4.7 moles) of anhydrous sodium carbonate in 1500 cc. of water, is now added slowly with hand stirring. When all is in, a sufficiently large quantity of the ice will have melted to allow a mechanical stirrer to be fitted. A stream of sulfur dioxide is now passed in, with continual stirring, the temperature being kept at 0–2°, until an acid reaction to Congo red paper is obtained and the dark color, which appears just before the reaction is complete, has faded. During the addition of the sulfur dioxide, 500 g. more of ice may be added.
A 300-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirrer, a thermometer, a glass stopper, and an efficient condenser attached to a nitrogen line with a gas bubbler. The system is flushed with dry nitrogen, then charged with 19.8 g. (0.100 mole) of biphenyl-2-carboxylic acid, 80 g. (60 ml., 0.59 mole) of trichlorosilane and, and 80 ml. of acetonitrile. A low nitrogen flow is maintained as the mixture is stirred and heated to reflux (40–45°) for 1 hour or until gas evolution ceases and the carboxylic acid has dissolved. The solution is then cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath to at least 0°, and the glass stopper is replaced with a 100-ml., pressure-equalizing dropping funnel charged with 37.8 g. (0.264 mole) of tri-n-propylamine and, which is emptied rapidly into the stirred solution. The cooling bath is removed, and the flask contents are allowed to stir until the reaction ceases to be exothermic. A heating mantle is then used to maintain reflux for 16 hours, during which time the temperature rises to 70–75°.
B. 1-p-Bromophenyl-1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloroethane. In a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer are placed 136 g. (0.60 mole) of 1-phenyl-2,2,2-trichloroethanol and 120 g. (81 ml., 0.77 mole) of bromobenzene. The flask is cooled in an ice-water bath, and a mixture of 120 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid and 50 ml. of oleum (20% SO3) is added with stirring at such a rate that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 10° (ca. 45 minutes). The mixture is stirred for another 30 minutes at 10° and for 4–5 hours at room temperature. It is then poured with manual stirring onto 1 kg. of cracked ice, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The precipitate is filtered, washed with water, and recrystallized from 300 ml. of ethanol. The yield is 129–162 g. (59–74%), m.p. 95–96°.
In a 1-l. beaker on a steam bath, 155 g. (0.78 mole) of p-acetaminobenzenesulfinic acid is suspended in 310 ml. of water. The suspension is stirred by hand and warmed gently while it is neutralized by the addition of a solution of 31.5 g. of sodium hydroxide in 125 ml. of water. The solution is then transferred to a 2-l. flask and the bulk of the water is removed under the vacuum of a good water pump; 330–350 ml. of water is removed during 1.5 hours. During this time, the solid salt begins to separate. When bumping becomes severe, the flask is cooled by immersion in an ice bath for 30 minutes, and the salt is filtered with suction. The filtrate is concentrated as before, the product being added to the first crop. The second filtrate, on concentration, yields a less pure salt which may be worked up separately. The yields are 107–124 g. (63–73%) of the first crop, 25–34 g. (15–20%) of the second crop, and 12–17 g. (7–10%) of material of inferior grade.
A solution of 80 g. (0.5 mole) of 1,4-naphthoquinone [Org. Syntheses Coll. Vol. 1, 375 (1932), 383 (1941)] and 80 g. (1 mole) of 2,3-dimethylbutadiene-1,3 (p. 312) in 300 ml. of alcohol is refluxed for 5 hours, using a 1-l. round-bottomed flask and an efficient reflux condenser. The solution is cooled and placed in a refrigerator for 10–12 hours. The crystalline mass is then broken up with a spatula, and the addition product is filtered and washed with 50 ml. of cold ethanol. The product forms white, feathery crystals melting at 147–149°. The yield is 116 g. (96% based on the 1,4-naphthoquinone).
In a 500-cc. Pyrex distilling flask is placed 150 g. (2.7 moles) of potassium hydroxide. The mouth of the flask is provided with a one-holed stopper holding a dropping funnel; the side tube of the flask is connected with a condenser set for downward distillation.
In a 2-l. flask fitted with a total-reflux, variable-take-off distillation head is placed a solution of 53 g. (0.472 mole) of dihydroresorcinol, 2.3 g. of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and 250 ml. of absolute ethanol in 900 ml. of benzene. The mixture is heated to boiling and the azeotrope composed of benzene, alcohol, and water is removed at the rate of 100 ml. per hour. When the temperature of the distilling vapor reaches 78°, the distillation is stopped and the residual solution is washed with four 100-ml. portions of 10% aqueous sodium hydroxide which have been saturated with sodium chloride. The resulting organic solution is washed with successive 50-ml. portions of water until the aqueous washings are neutral and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure. The yield of 3-ethoxy-2-cyclohexenone, b.p. 66–68.5°/0.4 mm. or 115–121°/11 mm., n29D 1.5015, is 46.6–49.9 g. (70–75%).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask with a reflux condenser, 104 g. (0.5 mole) of anthraquinone, m.p. 276–280° (corr.), is mixed with 100 g. (0.86 atom) of granulated tin, and 750 cc. of glacial acetic acid is added. The contents of the flask are heated to boiling, and in the course of two hours, 298 g. (250 cc., 8.2 moles) of c.p. hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.19) is added in 10-cc. portions to the boiling mixture. At the end of this time all the anthraquinone should have gone into solution; if not, more tin and hydrochloric acid are added.
The material in the retort is heated with a free flame until the water present has distilled, then 30 g. of acid potassium sulfate is added and the distillation is continued. At first almost colorless sulfuric acid distils. As soon as crystals of pyromellitic anhydride appear, the receiver is replaced by one containing 50 cc. of water and the distillation is continued until nothing more passes over. The retort is then rinsed with 100 cc. of water and the rinsings are filtered and evaporated on the steam bath to 25 cc.. The last distillate is also evaporated to 25 cc. On cooling, pyromellitic acid crystallizes. The product from both portions is collected on a suction funnel, using hardened filter paper, washed with two 10-cc. portions of ice water, and recrystallized from four parts of boiling water. After drying at 105° the product (containing 2 moles of water of crystallization) melts at 271° (262° uncorr.). The yield is 6–8 g..
A solution of sodium ethoxide is prepared by adding 57.5 g. (2.5 g. atoms) of clean sodium to 1.2 l. of absolute ethanol in a 3-l. three-necked flask equipped with an Allihn reflux condenser fitted with a drying tube, a large sturdy sealed Hershberg stirrer, and a dropping funnel. After the sodium has dissolved, the solution is cooled to 40° and the condenser is replaced by a thermometer extending into the liquid. A mixture of 245.5 g. (258.5 ml., 2.5 moles) of redistilled cyclohexanone and 198 g. (175 ml., 3.25 moles) of redistilled nitromethane is added dropwise with vigorous stirring over the course of about 3 hours at a rate that maintains an internal temperature of 45 ± 3°. After addition is complete, the white, pasty mass is stirred for an additional 3 hours without cooling or heating and then is allowed to stand overnight. The resulting suspension is cooled with an ice bath, and the white sodium salt of 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is collected on a 25-cm. Büchner funnel and dried by suction for about 1 hour. The sodium salt cake is broken up and transferred to a 4-l. beaker equipped with a Hershberg stirrer and immersed in an ice bath. A cold solution of 184 g. (175 ml., 3 moles) of glacial acetic acid in 1250 ml. of water is added in a single portion, and the mixture is stirred for 10–30 minutes to complete dissolution. The oily layer of 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted with three 100-ml. portions of ether. The ether extracts and the 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol are combined, dried briefly over magnesium sulfate, and concentrated by distillation from a steam bath with a water aspirator at 20–35 mm. to remove ether and excess nitromethane. The crude, undistilled 1-(nitromethyl)cyclohexanol is dissolved in 450 ml. of glacial acetic acid in a 2-l. externally cooled stainless-steel hydrogenation bottle. Three heaping teaspoonfuls of W-4 Raney nickel catalyst2 are added, and the mixture is shaken with hydrogen at 40–45 p.s.i., with cooling to maintain the temperature below 35°, until about 90% of the theoretical amount (7.5 moles) is taken up and absorption ceases. The catalyst is separated by filtration with suction through Filter-Cel, and the filtrate (sometimes green or tan) containing the 1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexanol is used directly in the next step.
After a total of 20–22 hours, 100 ml. of ether is added, followed by 100 ml. of water. The layers are separated, and the organic phase is washed four times with 100-ml. portions of water, and finally with 100 ml. of saturated sodium chloride. After drying the organic phase over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, the solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator. The crude product is transferred to a 50-ml. flask and distilled through a 20-cm. Vigreux column, yielding 14.1–14.6 g. (82–85%) of geranyl chloride as a colorless liquid, b.p. 78–79° (3.0 mm.) and.
The mixture is concentrated to about 200 ml. at 50° (30 mm.), diluted with 200 ml. of ether, and washed with 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, two 100-ml. portions of 0.5 M aqueous ammonium chloride, and 100 ml. of saturated aqueous sodium chloride. Each of the aqueous washes is extracted with the same 100-ml. portion of ether. The combined ethereal solution is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated at 25° (10 mm). The residual material is distilled under reduced pressure without a column, and the fraction boiling at 96–97° (9 mm.) or 89–90° (7 mm.) affords 31.4–35.7 g. (86–97%) of 1,3-bis(methylthio)-2-methoxypropane,.
B. 1,10-Diazacycloöctadecane. A 500-ml., round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, condenser, and nitrogen bubbler is charged with 150 ml. of dry tetrahydrofuran and 3.8 g. (0.10 mole; 33% excess) of lithium aluminum hydride. While the suspension is stirred, 14.1 g. (0.0500 mole) of 1,10-diazacycloöctadecane-2,9-dione is added in small portions through a Gooch tube. When the addition is complete and evolution of hydrogen subsides, the mixture is heated at reflux under a nitrogen atmosphere for 48 hours. The mixture is cooled to 5–10° with an ice bath and decomposed by cautious, dropwise addition of 3.8 ml. of water, followed by 3.8 ml. of 15% sodium hydroxide, and finally by 11.8 ml. of water. The mixture is allowed to come to room temperature, stirred for an additional hour, and filtered through a fritted-glass funnel. The resulting cake is washed thoroughly with three 50-ml. portions of tetrahydrofuran, followed by three 50-ml. portions of diethyl ether. The combined filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. After purging with benzene to remove traces of water and storing under vacuum overnight, 12.7 g. of crude diimine remains as a colorless, waxy solid.
The reaction mixture is distilled under reduced pressure through a 13-cm. Vigreux column. The fraction boiling below 65° (50 mm.) is collected and washed with 50 ml. of water, then with 50-ml. portions of cold 1 N sodium hydroxide until the washings no longer contain phenol. The product is washed again with 50 ml. of water, dried over calcium chloride and redistilled, yielding 51–60 g. (64–75%) of neopentyl iodide, b.p. 54–55° (55 mm.), nD21 1.4882.
A. (E)-(Carboxyvinyl)trimethylammonium betaine. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel, and a thermometer. The flask is charged with 25.0 g (0.255 mol) of ethyl propiolate, 14 mL of dichloromethane, and 440 mL of water. The mixture is cooled to 5°C and 90 mL (0.35 mol) of an aqueous 25% solution of trimethylamine is added under vigorous stirring over a 30-min period. The reaction temperature remains between 0 and 5°C during the addition and then is allowed to warm to 25°C for 3 hr. The dichloromethane layer is separated and the aqueous layer is washed 3 times with 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The aqueous layer is placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask and concentrated at 15 mm pressure with a rotary evaporator equipped with a dry-ice condenser. The flask is heated to approximately 45°C. When the residue gives the appearance of a wet solid, it is treated with 150 mL of dioxane and concentrated as described above. Dioxane treatment followed by concentration is repeated 3 more times with 150-mL portions of dioxane. The yellow solid residue is triturated with acetonitrile until a white solid is obtained. The solid is collected and dried at 0.1 mm, 25°C for 14 hr to give 25.0–26.9 g (76–82% yield) of (E)-(carboxyvinyl)trimethylammonium betaine, mp 176–177°C (dec).
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask fitted with a three-holed stopper bearing a mechanical stirrer, a separatory funnel, and a gas outlet tube leading to a hood are placed 1 l. of anhydrous ether and 156 g. (4 moles) of finely ground sodium amide (p. 778). The flask is surrounded by a well-packed ice-salt bath. To the vigorously stirred mixture 232 g. (4 moles) of dry acetone is added, dropwise, during a period of 3 hours. With the flask cooled to −10°, a slow current of acetylene is passed through the reaction mixture for 2 hours to sweep out the ammonia. The three-holed stopper is then replaced by a two-holed stopper having a stopcock and an inlet tube reaching to the bottom of the flask and connected with a cylinder of acetylene. The stopper is wired in. The mixture is placed in an ice-salt mixture, the whole being mounted on a shaking machine and agitated vigorously for 10 hours; the mixture is kept under a pressure of 10 lb. of acetylene. Every 30 minutes the pressure is released by means of the stopcock, to sweep out ammonia formed from small amounts of previously unreacted sodium amide.
In order to obtain practically colorless alloxan monohydrate, 25 g. of the yellow crystals is dissolved in 37 ml. of hot water, the solution is boiled with Norit, and the hot solution is filtered into a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask. About 15–20 ml. of water is removed by distillation under reduced pressure on a water bath. The colorless crystalline residue is dissolved in the minimal volume of hot water, the solution is cooled somewhat, and to it is added 250 ml. of glacial acetic acid. After the mixture has been kept cold (5–10°) for 4–6 hours, the alloxan monohydrate is filtered. The yield is 20–21 g. (80–84% recovery) of practically colorless crystals which melt at about 254° with decomposition.
The reaction mixture is permitted to stand at room temperature during one hour, or longer if desired. The solution is acidified with 160 cc. of glacial acetic acid and, after the temperature has been lowered to 40° by cooling, the precipitated arsenious oxide is filtered off by suction and washed with 50 cc. of water.
A. 1-[(Methoxymethoxy)methyl]cycloheptanol. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a rubber septum, an argon inlet adapter, and a thermometer port. The apparatus is flame dried under reduced pressure and evacuated; the vacuum is broken with argon. The flask is charged with tributyl[(methoxymethoxy)methyl]stannane4 (10.5 g, 28.7 mmol) and evacuated for 15 min; the vacuum is broken with argon. The flask is charged with 40 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran, a low temperature thermometer is set into the flask and the solution is cooled to −78°C using a dry ice-acetone bath. A solution of butyllithium (2.5 M in hexanes, 11.2 mL, 28.0 mmol) is added via a syringe over a period of ~5 min while maintaining a reaction temperature below −60°C. Stirring is continued for no more than 5 min, at which time cycloheptanone (2.70 g, 24.0 mmol) is added neat via a syringe. After the solution is stirred for 30 min at −78°C, the dry ice-acetone bath is removed and the reaction mixture is diluted with 40 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. The resulting mixture is stirred for 30 min and then extracted with three 40-mL portions of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are washed with 20 mL of saturated aqueous sodium chloride, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to provide 12.8 g of crude product. The crude product is purified by flash chromatography on a 70-mm diameter column packed with 130 g of silica gel using 5% ethyl acetate/hexane to elute the tin by-products and 30% ethyl acetate/hexane to elute the title compound. The product fractions are combined and concentrated at reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to provide 1-[(methoxymethoxy)methyl]cycloheptanol (4.1–4.3 g, 91–95% based on cycloheptanone) as a colorless liquid.
C. Bromotris[2-(perfluorohexyl)ethyl]tin . The fluorous phenyltinproduct (17.2 g, 13.9 mmol) and dry ether (80 mL) are transferred to a 250-mL, three-necked flask that had been dried in an oven and cooled to 0°C under argon. Bromine (0.71 mL, 14 mmol) is added dropwise over 30 min to the mixture. The addition rate is adjusted to keep the temperature between 0° and 1°C. The mixture is warmed to 25°C and stirred for 7 hr. The reaction mixture is transferred to a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask. The ether and excess bromine are removed under reduced pressure to leave a yellow oil. The oil is dissolved in FC-72 (75 mL) and transferred to a 250-mL separatory funnel. The bromine and bromobenzene by-products are removed by washing three times with methylene chloride (3 × 75 mL) leaving the fluorous layer colorless. The FC-72 is removed under reduced pressure to provide 15.8 g (12.7 mmol, 92%) of a colorless oil.
The 500-mL flask containing the crude dry product (17.2 g) is filled with argon and dry tetrahydrofuran (150 mL), a magnetic stirring bar is added, the flask is sealed with a rubber septum, and argon is introduced once again. The flask is gently swirled until the viscous oil is totally dissolved and then the flask is immersed in a dry ice–acetone bath.
B. 2-Methyl-2-cyclohexenone. (a) Collidine method. The crude (undistilled) 2-chloro-2-methylcyclohexanone prepared as described above (part A) is transferred to a 1-l. three-necked flask fitted with a stout sealed Hershberg wire stirrer and two efficient reflux condensers, one attached to each side neck; and 290 ml. (266 g., 2.2 moles) of 2,4,6-collidine is added rapidly through one of the condensers with stirring. The flask is heated to 145–150° (bath temperature) with an oil bath until there ensues a sudden exothermic reaction which results in vigorous boiling of residual carbon tetrachloride. The reaction is essentially complete within 1 minute, and the mixture becomes very viscous with suspended collidine hydrochloride. The heating is discontinued, and, as the reaction mixture cools and becomes viscous enough to impede stirring, a total of 500 ml. of benzene is added cautiously (with vigorous boiling) through a condenser in order to maintain fluidity. The collidine hydrochloride is collected by suction filtration on a 10-cm. sintered glass suction filter, then transferred to a beaker, triturated with 300 ml. of benzene, and refiltered. After repetition of this treatment, the weight of residual salt is about 303 g. (96%).
The solid is washed several times by decantation, using cold water, and finally filtered with suction. It is then dissolved in dilute ammonia (1 volume of concentrated ammonia with 2 volumes of water) while it is still on the filter paper in the suction funnel. The filtrate is evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The resulting glassy, light yellowish-brown ammonium salt, which weighs 19–22 g. (83–96 per cent of the theoretical amount) is sufficiently pure for use as a test for aluminum.1
The contents of the flask are then poured upon 600 g. of cracked ice, and, with hand stirring, 75 ml. of hydrochloric acid (sp. gr. 1.18) is added. The cold mixture is now filtered through glass wool in an ordinary funnel into a 2-l. separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is separated and extracted once with 250 ml. of ether. The combined extract and main product are dried over 30 g. of calcium chloride, the ether is removed on a steam bath, and the residue is distilled using a 500-ml. modified Claisen flask. The selenophenol is collected at 57–59°/8 mm. or 84–86°/25 mm.; the yield is 43–54 g. (57–71%) and through. The product should be sealed at once in a glass vial.
The mixture is cooled to about 15° and filtered on a large Büchner funnel to remove insoluble material, chiefly p-chloroaniline. The filtrate is placed in a 5-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer, and a downward condenser; it is concentrated by distillation over a flame to a volume of 1.5 l.. The condenser is replaced by a thermometer, the stirrer is started, and the dropping funnel is charged with 230 ml. of 30% hydrogen peroxide. The temperature of the reaction mixture is maintained at 65–70° while the hydrogen peroxide is added dropwise over a period of about 2 hours.
A 1-l. distilling flask with a wide side arm may be used for the decomposition of the tetrazonium borofluoride. A 500-cc. distilling flask is fastened directly to the side arm of the decomposition flask and cooled with running water. To the side arm of the receiver is connected a rubber tube which is placed over 2 l. of water in a 5-l. flask. The solid to be decomposed is placed in the decomposition flask and heated at the upper edge with a Bunsen burner. When white fumes begin to be evolved, the burner is removed and the decomposition permitted to continue spontaneously. More heat is applied as needed. Finally vigorous heating is employed to ensure complete decomposition. Some 4,4'-difluorobiphenyl is collected in the receiver, but the larger portion remains in the decomposition flask, from which it is recovered by steam-distilling the black residue. A second steam distillation gives a pure white compound melting at 88–89°, after drying in an oven at 60–70°. When 153 g. of the tetrazonium borofluoride is decomposed in this manner, 61–62 g. of 4,4'-difluorobiphenyl is obtained (80–81.5 per cent of the theoretical amount, based on the tetrazonium borofluoride; 54–56 per cent based on the benzidine used).
Recrystallization from benzene-light petroleum ether (8 ml. and 4 ml. respectively per gram of the dried precipitated material) gives lustrous needles of o-chlorophenylcyanamide, m.p. 105–106° (60–70% recovery). The above method is generally applicable and affords an excellent route to arylcyanamides.
Distillation of the alcoholic filtrate (Caution!) under reduced pressure and in an atmosphere of nitrogen permits the isolation of an additional 8–10 g. of 3,4-dinitro-3-hexene. The blue oil boiling below 75°/20 mm. is discarded. To the undistilled residue is added 25 ml. of 95% ethanol, the resulting solution is cooled in an ice-salt bath, and the crystals are collected on a cold Büchner funnel and washed with 5 ml. of ice-cold alcohol. The combined crops of crystals are recrystallized from 80 ml. of 95% ethanol. The pure 3,4-dinitro-3-hexene separates as light-yellow needles, m.p. 31–32°, weight 50–55 g. (29–32%).
A mixture of 100 g. (0.89 mole) of citraconic anhydride 100 cc. of water, and 150 cc. of dilute nitric acid (1 part of concentrated nitric acid to 4 parts of water by volume) is evaporated in a 500-cc. Erlenmeyer flask until the appearance of red fumes. The solution is cooled and the mesaconic acid is collected on a filter. The mother liquor is evaporated to 150 cc., cooled, and the crystalline solid which separates is collected on a filter. Further concentration of the mother liquor to 50 cc. yields more product. The entire product is recrystallized from 100 cc. of water. The yield of mesaconic acid melting at 203–205° is 50–60 g. (43–52 per cent of the theoretical amount).
B. trans,trans-1,3-Butadiene-1,4-diyl diacetate. A solution of the diacetate (83.0 g., 0.373 mole) and dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate [Org. Synth., Coll. Vol. 4, 329 (1963); 54.0 g., 0.380 mole] in benzene (250 ml.) is placed in a 500-ml. flask and refluxed for 6 hours. The solution is filtered to remove the remaining mercury and mercury salts, and the benzene is distilled under reduced pressure. The residual viscous yellow oil is distilled under reduced pressure. A mixture of 1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl diacetate and dimethyl phthalate is collected at 140–155° (18–20 mm.), bath temperature 170–200°, from which the diene crystallizes as colorless needles in the cooled receiver. The solid is broken up, washed onto a Büchner funnel with petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°), pressed between sheets of filter paper to remove excess dimethyl phthalate, and recrystallized from ca. 1:2 acetone–petroleum ether (b.p. 60–70°), yielding 26–31 g. (41–49%) of trans,trans-1,3-butadiene-1,4-diyl diacetate, as colorless needles, m.p. 102–104°,(Note 11), and.
A solution of 15 g. of sodium dihydrogen phosphate in 5 l. of distilled water is placed in a 6-l. separatory funnel. To this solution is added 90 g. (0.33 mole) of dipotassium nitrosodisulfonate (Fremy's salt). The mixture is shaken to dissolve the inorganic radical. A solution of 16 g. (0.13 mole) of 3,4-dimethylphenol in 350 ml. of diethyl ether is added quickly to the purple solution. As the mixture is shaken vigorously for 20 minutes, the color of the solution changes to red-brown. The o-quinone thus formed is extracted in three portions with 1.2 l. of chloroform. The combined organic layers are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure at 20–23°. The residual, somewhat oily, red-brown crystals are slurried twice with 15 ml.-portions of ice-cold ether and collected on a filter. The dark-red crystals, after air drying, weigh 8.7–8.9 g. (49–50%), m.p. 105–107°.
C. Ethyl 2-methyl-5-phenyl-3-furancarboxylate.4 A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, an addition funnel, and a reflux condenser is flushed with argon. The reaction vessel is charged with 44.35 g of phenylacetylene (0.44 mol,), 0.38 g of rhodium(II) acetate dimer (0.00087 mol), and 100 mL of dichloromethane and the mixture is heated to reflux under an argon atmosphere. The addition funnel is charged with 13.57 g of ethyl diazoacetoacetate (0.087 mol) and 200 mL of dichloromethane, and this solution is added dropwise over 1.5 hr to the reaction mixture. After the reaction mixture is heated under reflux for an additional 12 hr, it is cooled and the solvent is removed under reduced pressure. The crude product is purified by chromatography on silica gel (110 g) with ether/petroleum ether (1:19) as eluant, followed by vacuum distillation (10-cm Vigreux column, 130°C, 0.1 mm) to yield 9.95 g (50%) of the furan as a pale yellow liquid.
The solution is allowed to cool, and the di-n-butylamine hydrobromide, which separates in the course of the reaction, is removed by means of a suction filter. The filtrate is transferred to a 500-ml. distilling flask, and the xylene is removed by distillation. The crude γ-di-n-butylaminopropylphthalimide, a brown oil, is transferred to a 500-ml. round-bottomed flask with a ground-glass joint and treated with 20 ml. of water and 120 ml. of 12 N hydrochloric acid. The flask is fitted with a reflux condenser, and the solution is heated for 6 hours in an oil bath maintained at 140–150°. After the solution has cooled to room temperature, the precipitated phthalic acid is removed by filtration and washed with four 25-ml. portions of cold water. The combined filtrates are transferred to a 600-ml. beaker and heated on a steam bath to evaporate the water and hydrochloric acid.
In a 1-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a thermometer extending nearly to the bottom, are placed 60 g. (1 mole) of urea and 69 g. (0.5 mole) of 95% n-heptanoic acid. A condenser is attached to the flask, and the mixture is heated by means of an electric mantle. When the temperature reaches 140°, the urea is in solution, and a rather vigorous evolution of gas occurs which continues for several minutes. The temperature is maintained at 170–180° for 4 hours, and then the mixture is allowed to cool.
B. (S)-(-)-4-Methyl-1-phenyl-2-pentyn-1,4-diol (5). A flame-dried, 50-mL, two-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a glass stopper, argon inlet adapter, and Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar is charged with (S)-BINOL (0.573 g, 2.0 mmol) and then transferred to a glove box and charged with InBr3 (0.713 g, 2.0 mmol). The flask is removed from the glove box and equipped with a rubber septum and a flame-dried reflux condenser fitted with an argon inlet adapter. Dichloromethane (10 mL) and then benzaldehyde (4.1 mL, 40 mmol) are added via syringe at room temperature. The resulting solution is stirred at 20–25 °C for 15 min, after which dicyclohexylmethylamine (2.1 mL, 10 mmol) is added by syringe. After 10 min, 2-methyl-3-butyn-2-ol (4) (7.8 mL, 80 mmol) is added in one portion by syringe and the resulting yellow solution is stirred at 40 °C (oil bath temperature) for 48 h. The reaction mixture is then allowed to cool to room temperature, poured into a 200-mL separatory funnel, and washed with 50 mL of aqueous 1 M HCl solution. The aqueous phase is separated and extracted with two 50-mL portions of dichloromethane, and the combined organic layers are dried over Na2SO4, filtered, and concentrated to afford 13.6 g of a yellow oil. This material is purified by silica gel column chromatography (elution with ethyl acetate/hexanes) to furnish 6.37–6.87 g (83-89%) of 5 as a colorless solid. The enantiomeric excess is determined to be 99% by CSP-HPLC.
(A) Potassium Benzohydroxamate.—Separate solutions of 46.7 g. (0.67 mole) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 318) in 240 cc. of methyl alcohol, and of 56.1 g. (1 mole) of c.p. potassium hydroxide in 140 cc. of methyl alcohol, are prepared at the boiling point of the solvent. Both are cooled to 30–40°, and the one containing alkali is added with shaking to the hydroxylamine solution; any excessive rise of temperature during the addition is prevented by occasional cooling in an ice bath. After all the alkali has been added, the mixture is allowed to stand in an ice bath for five minutes to ensure complete precipitation of potassium chloride. Fifty grams (0.33 mole) of ethyl benzoate is added with thorough shaking, and the mixture filtered immediately with suction. The residue in the funnel is washed with a little methyl alcohol. The filtrate is placed in an Erlenmeyer flask and allowed to stand at room temperature. Crystals begin to form within twenty minutes to three hours, depending upon the amount of supersaturation of the solution. After forty-eight hours the crystals are filtered, washed with a little absolute ethyl alcohol, and dried in air. The yield is 33–35 g. (57–60 per cent of the theoretical amount),, and.
D. 4,5,4',5'-Tetramethoxy-1,1'-biphenyl-2,2'-carboxaldehyde (4). The metalation procedure described in Section C is repeated using a 3-L flask, 18.4 g (0.056 mol) of 6-bromoveratraldehyde cyclohexylimine (1), 575 mL of tetrahydrofuran, and 40.6 mL (1.53 M, 0.062 mol) of butyllithium. After the metalation is complete at −78°C, the septum is replaced by a glass stopper. Solid cuprous iodide–triethyl phosphite complex (30.3 g, 0.085 mol) is added to the vessel at −78°C in one portion, immediately giving a green solution. The mixture is stirred for an additional 30 min. After the first 15 min, the solution turns a brownish-orange to red color. Solid 6-iodoveratraldehyde cyclohexylimine (3) (21.0 g, 0.056 mol) is added in one portion to produce an orange suspension. The reaction mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature (27°C), during which time the mixture becomes dark brown. The reaction mixture is stirred for 18 hr at room temperature. The reaction mixture is diluted with 600 mL of methylene chloride and 850 mL of 15% aqueous acetic acid and stirred vigorously for 17 hr. The yellow solution is transferred to a 4-L separatory funnel and the layers are separated. The organic layer is dried (anhydrous magnesium sulfate), filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator to 800 mL and then transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The organic solution is washed with 5% aqueous hydrochloric acid (5 × 100 mL) and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution (10 × 50 mL).
C. (4R)-(+)-tert-Butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one. A 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, pressure-equalizing addition funnel, and nitrogen inlet, is flame-dried under a stream of dry nitrogen. The apparatus is charged with 7.7 g (78 mmol) of (4R)-(+)-hydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one, 0.96 g (10 mol %) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 20 g (200 mmol) of triethylamine, and 150 mL of dry dichloromethane. The dropping funnel is charged with a solution of 14.2 g (94 mmol) of tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride in 50 mL of dry dichloromethane. Magnetic stirring is initiated, the reaction mixture is cooled in an ice-water bath, and the silyl chloride solution is added dropwise during 10 min. The ice-water bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred at room temperature for 3 hr; then 100 mL of deionized water is added with stirring. After the organic layer is separated, the aqueous phase is extracted three times with 50 mL of dichloromethane and the combined organic solutions are dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. The residue is filtered through a short column of silica gel with elution by 5% ethyl acetate in petroleum ether (bp 35–60°C). After concentration of the fractions containing the product, the resulting oil is distilled in a short path distillation apparatus (bp 60°C at 0.1 mm) to give 13.2 g of a colorless oil. Crystallization of this material from pentane with cooling by an acetone-dry ice bath gives 10.6 g (64%) of colorless needles, mp 27–28°C, [α]D20 +65.3° (CH3OH, c 0.4) and.
In a 500-cc. round-bottomed, three-necked flask provided with a thermometer, dropping funnel, a liquid-sealed stirrer, and calcium chloride tube are placed 16.8 g. (0.2 mole) of thiophene (p. 578), 15.6 g. (14 cc., 0.2 mole) of acetyl chloride, and 200 cc. of dry benzene. The solution is cooled to 0°, and 52 g. (23 cc., 0.2 mole) of freshly distilled stannic chloride is added dropwise, with efficient stirring, during the course of about forty minutes. The reaction mixture assumes a purple color when the first drops of stannic chloride are added, and soon a purple solid precipitates.
The mixture is then cooled, filtered with suction, the layers of water and organic liquid separated, and the latter washed with saturated salt solution. The amines are then dried by shaking with about 20 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, and again filtered with suction. The excess of aniline is removed by distillation under reduced pressure using a modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm (p. 130). The aniline distils at 81° /12 mm., and then the temperature rises quickly to the boiling point of benzylaniline, 180° /12 mm. or 190° /16 mm. When the temperature has risen to within about 5° of the boiling point of the benzylaniline, the receiver is again changed and the benzylaniline collected from 170–200° /12 mm., practically all boiling at 178–180° /12 mm..
When the reaction mixture has cooled to room temperature, 60 ml. of glacial acetic acid is added dropwise, and a heavy, pasty solid separates. Ice-cold water (about 200 ml.) is added dropwise, and the stirring is continued until all the solid material has gone into solution. The benzene layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is extracted three times using 100-ml. portions of benzene. The combined benzene extracts are washed three times with 100-ml. portions of cold water. The benzene is removed by distillation at atmospheric pressure, and the excess diethyl carbonate is removed under water-pump pressure with gentle heating. The residual material is transferred to a 100-ml. distillation flask, and the fraction boiling at 85–87° (0.1 mm.) is collected. The yield of 2-carbethoxycyclooctanone is 54–56 g. (91–94%), n25D 1.4795–1.4800.
A. 4-Ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde ethylene acetal. A 500-ml., three-necked flask with vertical necks is fitted with a magnetic stirring bar and a 30-ml. water separator, to which is attached a condenser topped with an argon inlet. The flask is charged with 300 mg. (0.00158 mole) of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate, 270 ml. of benzene, 33 g. (30 ml., 0.53 mole) of ethylene glycol, and 5.0 g. (0.028 mole) of 4-ethoxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, then placed under a positive pressure of argon, which is maintained throughout the reaction. Vigorous stirring is begun, and the solution is brought to reflux with an oil bath at 110°.
The pale yellow filtrate and washings from the Norite are diluted to 25 l. with tap water, and a solution of 600 g. of mercuric chloride in 2 l. of hot 95 per cent alcohol is added, with stirring. A concentrated solution of sodium carbonate (corresponding to about 350 g. of anhydrous sodium carbonate) is added slowly, with stirring, until the mixture reaches pH 7.0–7.5 (phenol red or litmus). After settling for several hours, preferably overnight, the supernatant liquid is siphoned off, and the crock is refilled with water to the original volume. The mixture is allowed to settle, the wash liquid siphoned off, and the precipitate washed twice more in the same fashion. After the third washing, the supernatant liquid is siphoned off and the precipitate collected with suction on a large Büchner funnel fitted with two layers of filter paper and a 2-mm. layer of infusorial earth.
D. 3-Acetyl-2(3H)-oxazolone. The crude mixture of 3-acetyl 4- and 5-chloro-2-oxazolidinone from Step C is placed in a 2-L, three-necked flask equipped with a thermometer, sealed mechanical stirrer, and gas discharge tube. The material is heated to 120°C with stirring, and the temperature is then slowly increased to 150°C and held there until the evolution of gas ceases. The cooled, black reaction mixture is distilled at 20 mm. The fractions boiling up to 150°C are collected and redistilled through a 50-cm × 3-cm Vigreux column fitted with a variable take-off head. There is obtained 140–172 g (55–68%) of product, bp 108–112°C (24 mm), which solidifies, mp 35–37°C.
The salt is added to a dilute solution of hydrochloric acid prepared by mixing 300 ml. of water and 56 ml. of concentrated acid (sp. gr. 1.18); the acid should be contained in a 1-l. flask under a reflux condenser. The mixture is warmed gently, whereupon carbon dioxide is evolved and an oil separates. The flask is heated on a steam bath for 1.5 hours, and the oil is then extracted from the cooled mixture with 150 ml. of benzene. The extract is washed once with 200 ml. of water and distilled under reduced pressure, using an ordinary 500-ml. Claisen flask. The hydratropaldehyde distils at 90–93°/10 mm. or 73–76°/4 mm. (oil bath at 120–130°), leaving only a slight residue (3–5 g.). The yield is 56–60 g. (65–70%) and.
The solid crystalline cake is dissolved in about 400 ml. of ether and extracted with 500 ml. of 2.5% potassium hydroxide solution. The alkaline solution is immediately acidified with 200 ml. of 10% hydrochloric acid, and the crude 3,12-diacetoxy-nor-cholanic acid is collected on a filter.
The combined ether solutions are dried overnight with about 80 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and then distilled under reduced pressure (5 to 12 mm.) through a 20-cm. asbestos-wrapped Vigreux distilling column, with an efficient water-cooled condenser. After the solvent and a small fore-run have been distilled, 150–171 g. (66–75%) of 1-diethylamino-3-butanone is collected as a light-yellow to nearly colorless liquid, b.p. 63–67°/7mm. (75–77°/15mm.), n25D 1.4300–1.4310. The product may contain a small amount of 1,1-bis(diethylaminomethyl)acetone (the bis-Mannich base), which can interfere with some uses of this product. Refractionation gives relatively pure material, 142–161 g. (62–70%), b.p. 72–75°/10mm., n25D 1.4301–1.4307, d254 0.8626, MD (found) 43.2–43.3, MD (calcd.) 43.1.
A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, dry ice condenser, and argon atmosphere is cooled by means of a dry ice/acetone bath and charged with approximately 150 mL of dry liquid ammonia. The 2-(2-cyclopentenyl)acetyl chloride reaction mixture is added carefully but steadily to the cold and rapidly stirred ammonia by syringe. (Caution: vigorous exothermic reaction!). Residual acid chloride is transferred by rinsing the first vessel with 5 mL of toluene. After the addition the mixture is stirred for an additional 5 min, then 60 mL of dichloromethane is added. The cold bath is removed and the excess ammonia is allowed to escape into the fume hood by stirring the open vessel overnight.
The 875 g. of dichlorohydrin thus obtained boils over a 7° range; this is 70 per cent of the theoretical amount. Redistillation yields 700–720 g. boiling at 70–73°/14 mm. (55–57 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The residual oil is transferred to a distillation flask, and the flask is carefully warmed with a small flame. After a fore-run of ethanol is collected, the variable transformer controlling the heating tape is set at a voltage to give an internal temperature in the distilling head of 80–100° before distillation. The flask is then heated to effect slow distillation at atmospheric pressure. About 10–13 g. of fore-run is collected before the temperature of the distillate vapor reaches 200°. The main fraction (68–71 g., 79–82%) is collected between 200° and 216° as a colorless oil. For most purposes, the fore-run is sufficiently pure that it can be combined with the main fraction to give an over-all yield of 78–81 g. (91–94%). Diethyl methylenemalonate polymerizes on standing to a white solid, from which the monomer can be recovered by slow distillation. The diethyl methylenemalonate should be distilled just prior to use.
In a 100-ml., three-necked, round-bottomed flask, fitted with a sealed mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a thermometer reaching to the bottom of the flask, are placed 37.6 g. (0.2 mole) of 2-methyl-2,5-decanediol (p.601) and 17 g. of 85% phosphoric acid. The limpid liquid obtained is heated and maintained at 125° for 40 minutes. Then the acidic lower layer is discarded, and the organic layer is washed with three or four 50-ml. portions of lukewarm distilled water.
Ten grams (0.41 g. atom) of magnesium turnings is placed in the flask and covered with 200 ml. of dry ether. Ten milliliters of a solution of 65.2 g. (0.40 mole) of 2-bromothiophene in 60 ml. of dry ether is added, the Grignard reaction is started by gently warming the reaction flask, and the remainder of the solution is added dropwise during 45 minutes. The mixture is stirred for 3.5 hours, the last 15 minutes under reflux. The Grignard reagent is cooled to 0–5° by immersing the flask in ice water. t-Butyl perbenzoate (62 g., 56 ml., 0.32 mole) in 100 ml. of dry ether is added dropwise during 45 minutes to the stirred ice-cooled mixture. The reaction mixture is stirred overnight, poured into ice water, and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid. The two phases are separated, and the water phase is twice extracted with ether. The combined ether solutions are extracted with three 60-ml. portions of 2N sodium hydroxide solution, washed until neutral with water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and transferred to a distillation flask equipped with a Vigreux column. Caution! The ether extract should not be distilled unless a test shows that peroxides are absent. The ether is distilled off at atmospheric pressure, and the residual oil is distilled under reduced pressure to give 35–38 g. (70–76%) of 2-t-butoxythiophene, b.p. 64–66°/13 mm., nD20 1.4991.
A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a stirrer, a thermometer, a dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser to which is attached a drying tube containing calcium chloride, is charged with 138 g. (131 ml., 1.00 mole) of resorcinol dimethyl ether and 200 ml. of dichloromethane. The solution is stirred, and a solution of 150 g. (1.06 moles) of chlorosulfonyl isocyanate in 100 ml. of dichloromethane is added with stirring at 15–20° over a 25-minute period. The amide N-sulfonyl chloride separates as a crystalline solid, and the mixture is stirred for an hour at room temperature. The resulting mixture is cooled to 10–12° and 154 g. (2.1 moles) of N,N-dimethylformamide is added over a period of 5 minutes. The cooling bath is removed and the temperature gradually rises to about 30°, then falls. After 1 hour the crystals dissolve and the reaction mixture is poured onto 200 g. of ice. After the ice has melted, dichloromethane (150 ml.) is added, the mixture is shaken, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with 100 ml. of dichloromethane, and the organic phases are combined and washed with 100 ml. of water. The dichloromethane is removed by distillation, giving a white solid that is triturated with 250 ml. of cold water, recovered by filtration, and dried, yielding 155–157 g. (95–96%) of 2,4-dimethoxybenzonitrile, m.p. 91°. GC using a Chromosorb W column with 10% butadiene sulfone as the stationary phase indicates that the product has a purity of 98%. The IR spectrum shows absorption at 2220 cm.−1 attributable to the cyano group.
A. Ethyl 2-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]propanoate. An oven-dried, 500-mL, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and purged with dry argon. The flask is charged with 10.0 g (84.6 mmol) of (S)-(−)-ethyl lactate, 23.3 g (84.6 mmol) of tert-butyldiphenylsilyl chloride, 14.4 g (211 mmol) of imidazole, and 50 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran. The resulting white suspension is stirred vigorously at 23°C for 2 hr. (At the beginning of the stirring, a heated water bath is useful to maintain the reaction temperature.) The mixture is then filtered through glass wool into 400 mL of water and the solids are washed with two 25-mL portions of tetrahydrofuran. The filtrate is concentrated to remove tetrahydrofuran under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator. The resulting aqueous suspension is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and is extracted with 400 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with two 400-mL portions of water, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give 30.0 g (99%) of ethyl 2-(S)-[(tert-butyldiphenylsilyl)oxy]propanoate as a clear colorless oil.
The esters are hydrolyzed by refluxing them for 2 hours with a solution of 112 g. of potassium hydroxide in 200 ml. of ethanol. Most of the ethanol is removed by distillation, and the mixture is then evaporated to dryness on a steam bath. The residue is dissolved in the minimum amount of hot water (100 to 125 ml.), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (about 90–95 ml.) is added until the solution is slightly acid. After the solution has been boiled for a few minutes to removed carbon dioxide, it is made slightly alkaline with ammonia. To the boiling solution there is added a slight excess of barium chloride. The hot solution is filtered to remove barium malonate, the filtrate is cooled, and to it is added 100 ml. of 12 N hydrochloric acid. The solution is then extracted with four 250-ml. portions of ether. The extracts are combined and dried over calcium chloride, and the ether is removed by distillation on a steam bath. The residual pasty mass (about 38 g.) is pressed on a porous plate to remove adherent oil and then dissolved in 30–50 ml. of hot ethyl acetate. The solution, when cooled in an ice-salt bath, deposits the pure dicarboxylic acid. This is filtered; the filtrate, when evaporated, yields a pasty mass of acid which, in turn, is crystallized from ethyl acetate. The yield of pure 1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylic acid melting at 156–158° is 30–34 g. (21–23%).
B. (2R,5S)-2-tert-Butyl-5-methyl-1-aza-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-4-one. In a 250-mL, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer, 18.3 mL (0.131 mol) of diisopropylamine is mixed with 120 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF,) under argon. At −78°C bath temperature, 88.6 mL of a 1.6 M solution of butyllithium (0.142 mol) in hexane is added and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature for 20 min. After the mixture is recooled to −78°C, the lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) solution is added over a period of 20 min to a solution of 20.0 g (0.109 mol) of (2R,5S)-2-tert-butyl-1-aza-3-oxabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-4-one in 600 mL of dry THF in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, precooled to −78°C. Tetrahydrofuran (20 mL) is used to rinse the 250-mL flask. After keeping the resulting solution at −78°C for 45 min, 8.8 mL (0.142 mol) of iodomethane is added over a period of 10 min. The resulting mixture is allowed to warm to 0°C over a period of 3 hr, and 300 mL of a saturated aqueous solution of ammonium chloride is added. After separation, the organic layer is washed with 300 mL each of saturated aqueous solutions of sodium carbonate and brine. Each aqueous layer is extracted twice with 200 mL of ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers are dried over magnesium sulfate and the solvent is removed in a rotary evaporator at ca. 15 mm. Traces of solvent are removed by drying the residue at 60°C/0.05 mm for 2 hr under an oil pump vacuum to yield 19.8–20.5 g (0.100–0.104 mol, 93–95%) of the desired product. It is used directly in the next step.
A dry, 500-mL, three-necked flask appropriately shaped to accommodate the horn of an ultrasonic processor is equipped with a thermometer and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which a nitrogen inlet is attached. A nitrogen atmosphere is established in the flask, which is charged with 100 mL of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF), 3.04 g (0.125 mol) of magnesium (Mg) turnings, 32.5 g (0.100 mol) of tributyltin chloride, and a small piece of iodine (optional), and then immersed in an ice-salt bath. After the temperature of the solution falls below 15°C, 13.4 mL (0.120 mol) of 1-chloro-3-methyl-2-butene in 50 mL of THF is added dropwise over 30–60 min while maintaining the temperature at less than 20°C under sonication at an output power of 30–75W. After the addition is complete, sonication is continued for a further 30–45 min to complete the reaction. The reaction mixture is poured into 400 g of ice water and the mixture is extracted with three 100-mL portions of ether. The combined ethereal solutions are washed with 50 mL of water and 50 mL of brine, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and evaporated under aspirator pressure to yield a colorless oil. This oil is further evacuated (1 mm) at room temperature for 1 hr to give 36 g (100%) of tributyl(3-methyl-2-butenyl)tin. This material is sufficiently pure for direct use in most reactions, but can be purified by distillation to afford 33.2 g (92%) of colorless oil, bp 105–107°C (0.01 mm),(Note 9),(Note 10).
A fore-run, consisting of ethyl stearate and an intermediate fraction, amounts to about 60 g., b.p. 185–204°/2 mm.. The product is a colorless liquid amounting to 265–275 g. (68.5–71% yield), b.p. 204–208°/2 mm., nD25 1.4433 and.
In a 3-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a reflux condenser, is placed 650 cc. of absolute alcohol, and to it 46 g. (2 gram atoms) of sodium is added as rapidly as possible without loss of material through the condenser. If the sodium does not entirely dissolve, heat is applied. To the hot sodium ethoxide solution 312 g. (2.1 moles) of ethyl oxalate (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 261) is added as rapidly as possible. Then, immediately, 234 g. (2 moles) of benzyl cyanide (Org. Syn. Coll. Vol. I, 1941, 107) is added, and the reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight. The solution is transferred to a 3-l. beaker and treated with 250–300 cc. of water. It is then warmed to 35° and made strongly acid to litmus with concentrated hydrochloric acid. Mechanical stirring is used during the acidification. On cooling to ordinary temperatures the ester crystallizes. The yield is 360–385 g. of lemon-yellow crystals melting at 126–128°. On recrystallization from 60 per cent alcohol, the ester melts at 130°. The final yield is 300–325 g. (69–75 per cent of the theoretical amount).
(B) 2-Aminofluorene.—In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, 30 g. (0.14 mole) of dried and powdered 2-nitrofluorene is made into a thin paste with 1 l. of 78 per cent alcohol (820 cc. of 95 per cent alcohol and 180 cc. of water). A solution of 10 g. of calcium chloride in 15 cc. of water, together with 300 g. of zinc dust, is added to the suspension, and the whole is thoroughly mixed. The flask is fitted with an effective reflux condenser, and the mixture is refluxed for two hours.
A 2-L, three-necked flask was equipped with an overhead mechanical stirrer, a Claisen adapter that contained a low-temperature thermometer, and a no-air stopper that held a gas dispersion tube for the introduction of carbon monoxide. The flask was charged with 400 mL each of tetrahydrofuran (THF) and diethyl ether, 100 mL of pentane, and pinacolone (7.92 g, 79.1 mmol). The reaction solution was cooled to −110°C and under an argon atmosphere and carbon monoxide was bubbled in for 30 min. Then a solution of butyllithium (2.53 N solution in pentane, 31.0 mL, 78.43 mmol) was added at 0.6–1.0 mL/min by means of a syringe pump. The reaction mixture was orange after the addition had been completed. The reaction mixture was stirred at −110°C for 2 hr while the carbon monoxide stream was continued. The liquid nitrogen Dewar was removed, and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature over the course of 1.5 hr, during which time the color changed to yellow. The reaction mixture subsequently was quenched by the addition of 300 mL of saturated ammonium chloride solution, which resulted in a light-yellow organic layer and a clear, colorless aqueous phase. The aqueous layer was separated and washed twice with 100 mL of pentane. The organic layers were combined, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, and filtered. The solvents were removed by fractional distillation (9-in. Vigreux column). The residue was distilled through a 7-cm jacketed column to give 9.7–10.8 g (67–73%) of 3-hydroxy-2,2,3-trimethyloctan-4-one, 97% pure by GLC, bp 120–122°C (30 mm), and nD20 1.442.
A. (R,R)-(−)-Pseudoephedrine glycinamide. An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with an argon inlet adapter, a rubber septum, a 150-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel fitted with a rubber septum, and a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar. The flask is flushed with argon and charged with 30.8 g (0.726 mol, 2 equiv) of anhydrous lithium chloride, 60.0 g (0.363 mol, 1 equiv) of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine, and 500 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF). The resulting slurry is cooled in an ice bath. After 15 min, 6.89 g (0.182 mol, 0.5 equiv) of solid lithium methoxide is added to the reaction flask in one lot. The resulting mixture is stirred at 0°C for 10 min, after which time the pressure-equalizing addition funnel is charged with a solution of 40.4 g (0.454 mol, 1.25 equiv) of glycine methyl ester in 100 mL of dry THF, and dropwise addition of this solution is initiated. The addition is completed within 1 hr, and the reaction flask is maintained at 0°C for an additional 7 hr. The reaction is terminated by the addition of 500 mL of water. The bulk of the THF is removed from the resulting colorless solution by concentration under reduced pressure. An additional 250 mL of water is added to the aqueous concentrate, and the resulting aqueous solution is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel and extracted sequentially with one 500-mL and four 250-mL portions of dichloromethane . The combined organic extracts are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure. The clear, colorless, oily residue is dissolved in 300 mL of warm (50°C) THF, 10 mL of water is added, and the resulting solution is allowed to cool to 23°C, whereupon the product crystallizes as its monohydrate within 1 hr. The crystallization process is completed by cooling the crystallization flask to −20°C. After standing for 2 hr at −20°C, the crystals are collected by filtration and rinsed with 200 mL of ether . The crystals are dried under reduced pressure (0.5 mm) at 23°C for 2 hr to provide 62.8 g (72%) of (R,R)-(−)-pseudoephedrine glycinamide monohydrate.
In a 3-l. three-necked flask, equipped with a Hershberg stirrer, a reflux condenser, and a dropping funnel, are placed 175 g. (3.6 moles) of sodium cyanide and 125 ml. of distilled water. The mixture is stirred until the sodium cyanide is dissolved, and then, while vigorous stirring is continued, 535 g. (360 ml., 3.5 moles) of β-ethoxyethyl bromide (p. 370) in 260 ml. of 95% ethanol is added over a period of 15 minutes. The separatory funnel is replaced by a 360° thermometer, and the mixture is stirred and gently refluxed for 10 hours.
A solution of 22.0 g of the alcohol (0.19 mol) and 17.6 g (0.26 mol) of imidazole in dichloromethane (100 mL) is cooled in an ice bath, and 36.2 g (0.24 mol) of tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride is added in one portion. The mixture is stirred for 15 min at 0°C and for a further 20 min at room temperature. Water (200 mL) is then added, and the organic layer is separated. The aqueous layer is extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 50 mL), and the combined organic extracts are dried over sodium sulfate prior to evaporation of the solvent. Purification of the residue by silica chromatography [ 1 kg of silica, 8.5-cm × 43-cm column eluting with ethyl acetate:petroleum ether (3:7)] yields 45 g (ca. ~ 100%) of (5S)-(5-O-tert-butyldimethylsiloxymethyl)furan-2(5H)-one as a colorless solid, mp 31°C and [α] D 20 −146° (in chloroform , c 0.2).
Fraction III may be methylated to the tetramethylbenzene stage by heating on the steam bath with 100 g. of anhydrous aluminum chloride and passing in 225 g. of methyl chloride. The filtrates from the durene likewise yield more durene when heated on the steam bath with 50 g. of aluminum chloride. The products are worked up in the usual way; that is, they are decomposed by pouring onto twice their weight of chopped ice, separated from the aqueous layer, fractionated twice, and the durene frozen out as before. By conducting one methylation of the trimethylbenzene fraction, and one treatment of the durene filtrates, the combined yield of crude durene will average 1 to 1.4 kg. (25–35 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the original 30 moles of xylene).
D. Bis(pinacolato)diboron (1). A 2-L, three-necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, dropping funnel, and a reflux condenser connected to a nitrogen source and a bubbler is flushed with nitrogen. To the flask are added 53.7 g (0.271 mol) of tetrakis(dimethylamino)diboron and 510 mL of toluene, and then a solution of 64.4 g (0.545 mol) of pinacol in 340 mL of toluene . The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath and a 5.4 M ethereal solution of hydrogen chloride (203 mL, 1.10 mol) is added dropwise during 2 hr. As soon as the addition is started, a white precipitate of dimethylamine hydrochloride appears. The slurry is stirred at room temperature for an additional 4 hr. The precipitate is removed by filtration in a Büchner funnel with suction, and the filtrate is concentrated on a rotary evaporator to give a white solid. The solid is dissolved in ca. 700 mL of pentane and the remaining solid is again removed by filtration. The filtrate is washed three times with 500 mL of water and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate . The drying agent is removed by filtration and the filtrate is concentrated to ca. 150 mL. The flask is heated to dissolve the resulting precipitate, allowed to cool to room temperature, and then thoroughly chilled in a freezer (−30°C). The first crop is collected by filtration and washed twice with 30 mL of cold pentane . The mother liquor is again concentrated to give another crop of crystals. The procedure is repeated two additional times. The combined crystals are dried under reduced pressure (0.1 mm) for 16 hr at room temperature to give 54.3 g (79%) of 1 as colorless plates, mp 138°C, lit.4 mp 138°C,.
A 2-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with a mechanical stirrer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel, and a two-necked Claisen adapter holding a Dewar condenser (in the offset neck) and an adapter with stopcock for introduction of ammonia. The entire apparatus is flame-dried under a stream of nitrogen, which enters at the top of the Dewar condenser, and a positive pressure of nitrogen is maintained throughout the experiment. After anhydrous ammonia (1 l.) is introduced into the flask in liquid form, the condenser is filled with an acetone–dry ice slurry, and the inlet adapter is removed and replaced with a glass stopper. Stirring is begun, and the ammonia is dried by adding very small pieces of lithium (ca. 5 mg. each) until the blue color persists. Stirring is continued throughout the following reaction sequence.
The mother liquor is then concentrated to afford 2.4 g of a brown yellow liquid. Flash chromatography of this material on 30 g of SiO2 with elution by EtOAc then by EtOAc:MeOH (5:1 v/v) affords 0.63 g (2%) of 3-[(1S)-1,2-dihydroxyethyl)]-1,5-dihydro-3H-2,4-benzodioxepine and 0.69 g (92% recovery) of dihydroquinidine 9-O-(9'-phenanthryl) ether.
A. 5-Phenyl-1,3-dimethoxybenzene. To a 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a reflux condenser (central neck), an internal thermometer and a ground-glass stopper, 5-phenylcyclohexane-1,3-dione (7.98 g, 42.4 mmol) and methanol (80 mL) are added. Concentrated sulfuric acid (1 mL, 95%) is added dropwise over 1 min and the suspension turns into a homogeneous solution. After 10 min iodine (23.7 g, 93.4 mmol, 2.20 equiv) is added as a solid in one portion. The mixture is refluxed for 45 min (oil bath; T = 85 °C) and then cooled down to room temperature. The solution is added to an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution (0.5 m, 350 mL) and 150 mL of ether. Using a 1-L separatory funnel the aqueous phase is separated and the organic phase is washed with 2 × 100 mL of 0.5 m sodium thiosulfate solution, giving a yellowish organic phase. The aqueous phases are combined and extracted with 2 × 150 mL of ether. The combined organic phase was washed with brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate (1.80 g) and concentrated on a rotary evaporator (600 mmHg, 40 °C, then 15 mmHg), (8.87 g, light brown oil). Silica gel (10 g) and ethyl acetate (50 mL) are added and agitated. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator (125 mmHg, 40 °C, then 15 mmHg). A sintered glass funnel (h × d: 9 cm × 5 cm) is charged with 20 g of silica gel (ca. 2.5 cm layer). A layer of sand (0.5 cm) is put on top followed by the crude material adsorbed on silica gel and another layer of sand (0.5 cm). A mixture of hexanes and ethyl acetate (50:1; 750 mL) is passed through the silica gel plug by applying vacuum from below and collected. After evaporation of the solvent on a rotary evaporator and drying under vacuum (0.1 mmHg) biaryl 1 is obtained as a white solid (6.04-6.42 g, 66-71%, mp 61.0-61.9 °C).
B. 1,2-Bis(n-butylthio)benzene. In a 1-l., round-bottomed, three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a thermometer which reaches into the reaction mixture is placed a solution of 59.0 g. (0.25 mole) of o-dibromobenzene in a mixture of 250 ml. of quinoline and 80 ml. of pyridine. To this solution is added 84.0 g. (0.55 mole) of cuprous n-butylmercaptide, and the mixture is stirred and heated under reflux for 3.5 hours. Heating is stopped and the reaction mixture is allowed to cool to about 100°. It is then poured into a stirred mixture of 1500 g. of ice and 400 ml. of concentrated hydrochloric acid; occasional stirring is continued for about 2 hours. The aqueous part is then decanted from the dark brown, gummy residue and is extracted twice with 400 ml. portions of ether. The ether extract is added to the residue, and the resulting mixture is stirred for about 5 minutes. The ether solution is then decanted from the residue and is filtered. The residue is extracted twice more with 400-ml. portions of ether. The combined ether extract is washed twice with 100-ml. portions of 10% hydrochloric acid, once with water, and twice with 100-ml. portions of concentrated ammonia. After a final wash with water, the ether solution is dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate. The potassium carbonate is collected on a filter, and the ether is removed from the filtrate by distillation. The remaining brown oil is distilled in vacuum, giving a pale orange oil, b.p. 123–124°/0.3 mm., nD25 1.5684. The yield is 46.5–56.0 g. (73–87%).
After the reaction mixture has stood for one-half hour, water is added and the solution is extracted with ether. The ether solution is dried over calcium chloride and the ether is distilled. The residue is distilled under reduced pressure in an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. Thiobenzophenone boils at 174°/14 mm.; it distils as a blue oil which, if pure and dry, forms beautiful blue crystals on cooling. The yield of crude product is 10–12.5 g. (50–63 per cent of the theoretical amount).
The damp salt is added cautiously in small portions to 1.7 l. of boiling water in a 4-l. beaker in the course of 40 minutes. During the reaction, the water lost by vaporization is replaced. The solution is treated with 4 g. of Norit, boiled a few minutes, and filtered hot. The red filtrate is kept in an icebox for 12–16 hours; during this time scratching is employed occasionally to induce crystallization. The yield of orange crystals melting at 99–101° is 48–52 g. (59–64%). A solution of this product in about 1 l. of boiling benzene is treated with Norit, filtered, and concentrated to 300 ml. On cooling, 41–45 g. (51–56%) of light-tan crystals melting at 101–102° is obtained.
C. (E)-1,2-Di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene. The solution prepared above is placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a Liebig condenser (protected from moisture by a drying tube) and cooled with an ice bath; 28.9 g (0.258 mol) of solid potassium tert-butoxide is added in small portions through the condenser over a 30-min period. After addition, the cooling bath is removed and stirring is continued for 90–120 min until no more starting material is detected in the 1H NMR spectrum of a sample; enough ice water is then added to just dissolve all the inorganic salts. The organic layer is separated and the aqueous layer is extracted with hexane (2 × 100 mL). The combined hexane extracts are dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated at aspirator vacuum. The residue is distilled at 40°C/0.2 mm, with the collection flask at −78°C, to give a center cut of (E)-1,2-di-tert-butoxy-1-chloroethene (15.4–17.0 g, 58–63% yield from 2,3-di-tert-butoxy-1,4-dioxane) and.
The mixture is then gently heated, with continuous stirring, when trinitrobenzene separates in crystalline condition and floats on the surface of the liquid as a frothy layer. After about one and one-half hours the evolution of gas ceases; at this point the crystals begin to stir into the solution. The heating and stirring are continued for three-quarters of an hour, when the mixture is allowed to cool, and the crystals filtered off. A sample of the filtrate should be tested for undecomposed trinitrobenzoic acid: if a precipitate is produced by the addition of sulfuric acid the process must be continued. After recrystallization from glacial acetic acid, the product melts at 121–122°. The yield is 145–155 g. (43–46 per cent of the theoretical amount calculated from the trinitrotoluene).
The crude acid is dissolved in 300 cc. of hot water, boiled with 4–5 g. of decolorizing charcoal for a few minutes, and the solution filtered. After cooling thoroughly under the tap the purified product is filtered with suction and washed with 10–15 cc. of cold water. The purified acid weighs 35–40 g. (70–80 per cent of the theoretical amount) and melts at 211–212°.
A 125-ml. distilling flask is fitted with a condenser set for distillation and with a long-stem dropping funnel. The condenser is connected by means of an adapter to a 250-ml. Erlenmeyer flask. Through a second hole in the stopper of the Erlenmeyer flask is placed an outlet tube bent so as to pass into and nearly to the bottom of a second Erlenmeyer flask which is not stoppered. Both receivers are cooled in an ice-salt mixture; in the first is placed 10 ml. of ether, and in the second 35 ml. of ether. The inlet tube passes below the surface of the ether in the second flask.
In a 2-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a liquid-sealed mechanical stirrer, a gas inlet tube, and a tube to carry off hydrogen chloride and acetic acid vapors, are placed 915 cc. of glacial acetic acid, 327 g. (5 gram atoms) of zinc dust, and 352 g. (1 mole) of cetyl iodide (m.p. 20–22°) (p. 322). The mixture is saturated with dry hydrogen chloride and then stirred and heated on a steam bath. At the end of every five hours of heating, the mixture is again saturated with hydrogen chloride. After the reaction has proceeded for twenty-five hours, the mixture is allowed to cool, and the layer of hexadecane, which rises to the top of the reaction mixture, is separated. The residue is poured into 3 l. of water and filtered on a Büchner funnel to remove the zinc dust. The zinc dust is washed with 500 cc. of water and then with 250 cc. of ether. The combined water layers are extracted with two 500-cc. portions of ether. The ether extracts are combined and added to the hexadecane, and the resulting solution is washed with two 250-cc. portions of 20 per cent sodium hydroxide and then with water until free of alkali. The ether solution is dried with 150 g. of anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and distilled from a 500-cc. modified Claisen flask with a fractionating side arm. The yield of n-hexadecane boiling at 156–158°/14 mm. and melting at 16–17° is 192 g. (85 per cent of the theoretical amount).
In a 5-l. round-bottomed flask, fitted with a stopper holding a separatory funnel and an efficient reflux condenser closed at the top with a calcium chloride tube, are placed 80 g. (3.29 atoms) of magnesium turnings and 800 cc. of dry benzene. Through the dropping funnel is added gradually a solution of 90 g. of mercuric chloride in 400 g. (505 cc., 6.9 moles) of acetone, carefully at first and then more rapidly after the reaction starts. The time of addition is about five to ten minutes. Sometimes the reaction does not commence until a considerable proportion of the acetone solution of mercuric chloride has been added. In this case the reaction proceeds very vigorously when it does start, and the flask must be cooled in running water to avoid loss through the condenser. As soon as the first vigorous reaction is over, a mixture of 200 g. (258 cc., 3.45 moles) of acetone and 200 cc. of benzene is added. When the reaction slows down, the flask is heated on a water bath until no further reaction is evident (about two hours). During this time the magnesium pinacolate swells until it fills the flask about three-fourths full. The flask is removed from the condenser and shaken until the reaction mass is well broken up. The condenser is again attached and the heating continued for another hour.
The bomb is cooled, the remaining hydrogen is discharged, and the bomb is opened. The solution is transferred to a beaker, and the bomb is rinsed with a little methanol which is added to the solution. The catalyst is removed by filtration (Caution! The catalyst may be pyrophoric), and most of the filtrate is transferred to a 500-ml. Claisen flask set on a steam bath for distillation of the methanol; the remainder of the filtrate is introduced into the Claisen flask when the volume of the first portion has been reduced sufficiently by distillation. After all the methanol has been removed the aminoacetal is distilled under diminished pressure. The yield of m-aminobenzaldehyde dimethylacetal, a light-yellow liquid boiling at 123–124°/4 mm. or 110–112°/1.5 mm., is 168–196 g. (67–78%).
A. 2,3-Bis(phenylsulfinyl)-1,3-butadiene. In a 2-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, 25-mL dropping funnel, and a nitrogen inlet, are placed 7.75 g (0.09 mol) of 2-butyne-1,4-diol, 37.6 mL (0.27 mol) of triethylamine, and 700 mL of dichloromethane. After the diol is completely dissolved, the mixture is cooled to −78°C. To this solution is added 26.0 g (0.18 mol) of phenylsulfenyl chloride over a 30-min interval. The mixture is gradually warmed to room temperature and stirred for an additional 12 hr. The solution is then washed with 100 mL each of water, saturated ammonium chloride solution, saturated sodium bicarbonate solution, and brine, and dried over sodium sulfate. After filtration and concentration, the residue is recrystallized from methanol-ether (1:1) to give 20.1 g (74%) of 2,3-bis(phenylsulfinyl)-1,3-butadiene as a 1.1:1 mixture of diastereomers.
In a 500-cc. beaker are placed 360 g. (6.4 moles) of powdered potassium hydroxide and 240 g. (3 gram atoms) of black powdered selenium which have been previously ground together in a mortar. This mixture is heated in an oil bath at 140–150° until a thick, dark red liquid is formed, and then it is added in small portions to 400 cc. of ice water in a 5-l. flask. The solution is kept in an ice bath until used.
B. 8-exo-Iodo-2-azabicyclo[3.3.0]octan-3-one. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stirring bar, serum stopper, 50-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel, cold water bath, and argon atmosphere is charged with 12.5 g (100 mmol) of 2-cyclopentene-1-acetamide, 29.2 mL (210 mmol) of triethylamine, and 80 mL of dry pentane. By means of the addition funnel, 41 mL (210 mmol) of trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate is slowly added to the cooled and rapidly stirred amide suspension over a 50-min period. After the addition is complete, the reaction mixture is stirred for an additional 20 min at room temperature, then the stirring is stopped, and the two layers are allowed to separate.
The cold filtrates (solutions of monochlorourea) are transferred to a 3-l. two-necked flask immersed in an ice-salt bath. The flask is equipped with a slip- or mercury-sealed mechanical stirrer and an efficient reflux condenser. To the flask are added 500 g. of ice, 100 ml. of glacial acetic acid, and 136 g. (2.0 moles) of cyclopentene (or 1.43 times the weight increase in grams during introduction of the chlorine). Mechanical stirring is begun and is continued while the flask is kept packed in ice until the cyclopentene (the top layer) disappears and a heavy oil settles to the bottom.
(C) Diphenyl Triketone.—The 41.5 g. (0.16 mole) of triketone hydrate is distilled in vacuum from a Claisen flask heated by means of a sand bath. A distilling flask is used as a receiver, and no condenser is necessary. The neck of the receiving flask must be warmed, however, to prevent clogging of the apparatus by crystallization of the distillate. The anhydrous triketone distils at 174–176°/2 mm. as a reddish oil that solidifies to a light yellow, crystalline mass. This is dissolved in 70 cc. of hot ligroin (b.p. 90–120°); it separates on cooling in light yellow needles which melt at 68–70°. The yield is 35 g. (91 per cent of the theoretical amount based on the triketone hydrate; 59 per cent based on the dibenzoylmethane).
C. N-(Benzyloxycarbonyl)-L-vinylglycine methyl ester (4). Sulfoxide 3 (35.0 g, 0.11 mol) and Pyrex helices (35 g) are placed in a 1-L, round-bottomed flask, thoroughly mixed by shaking, and distilled from a preheated rocking Kugelrohr apparatus (195–200°C, 0.1–0.3 mm, 1 hr) into a chilled receiving flask cooled in powdered dry ice to afford a yellow oil and. Low pressure chromatography (LPC) of the crude oil gives the N-protected vinylglycine methyl ester 4 (17.4 g, 62%) of 95% purity and. Medium pressure liquid chromatography (MPLC) of the crude oil provides pure 4 in 60% yield from 3. L-Vinylglycine hydrochloride can be obtained from 4 in almost quantitative yield by refluxing in 6 N hydrochloric acid for 1 hr.2
A. Diethyl (2S,3S)-2-bromo-3-hydroxysuccinate (2). In an oven-dried, 300-mL, round-bottomed flask containing a Teflon-coated stirring bar is placed 26.0 g (0.126 mol) of diethyl L-tartrate. A pressure-equalizing dropping funnel containing 100 mL (0.504 mol) of 30% hydrobromic acid (HBr) in acetic acid is mounted on the flask and the top of the funnel is fitted with a nitrogen inlet vented through an oil bubbler. The system is placed under a nitrogen atmosphere, magnetic stirring is initiated, and contents of the flask are cooled in an ice-water bath. The contents of the dropping funnel are added to the cooled tartrate during 30 min and the yellow mixture is stirred for an additional 15 min after completion of the addition. The cooling bath is removed and the reaction mixture is allowed to reach 25°C and stir for an additional 10 hr or until disappearance of the tartrate as judged by TLC analysis. The light brown reaction mixture is poured into 500 g of ice, and the resulting mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and extracted four times with 80 mL of ether. The combined ether extracts are washed successively three times with 60 mL of water, and then 100 mL of brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure using a rotary evaporator to give a pale yellow oil.
In the flask are placed 240 g. (2 moles) of acetophenone and 1 l. of glacial acetic acid. The thermometer is adjusted so that it extends considerably below the surface of the solution, and chlorine is admitted at such a rate that the temperature does not exceed 60°. Chlorination is continued until an excess of the halogen has been absorbed. This requires about 5 hours; completion of the reaction is indicated by the development of a yellow color. The reaction mixture is poured over 6 l. of crushed ice in a 2-gal. jar. The mixture is stirred several times and allowed to stand until the ice has melted. The dichloroacetophenone, which separates as a heavy lachrymatory oil, is removed. The yield is 340–370 g. (90–97%). This product, containing only a few per cent of water and acetic acid, is pure enough for the preparation of mandelic acid. It may be purified by adding about 100 ml. of benzene, removing the water and benzene by distillation, and fractionally distilling the residual oil under reduced pressure. There is obtained 302–356 g. (80–94%) of a colorless oil boiling at 132–134°/13 mm. (142–144°/25 mm.).
In a 3-l. three-necked flask is placed a mixture of 94 g. (1 mole) of phenol and 350 g. (190 cc., 3.5 moles) of concentrated sulfuric acid, and the mixture is heated on a boiling water bath for three hours with constant mechanical stirring. At the end of this time the boiling water bath is replaced by an ice bath. When the reaction mixture has been cooled to room temperature it is made alkaline by the careful addition of a solution of 280 g. (7 moles) of sodium hydroxide in 700 cc. of water. This must be done slowly and with good cooling to prevent boiling. A solid salt, which at first separates, largely dissolves at a later stage.
The chromic acid oxidizing reagent is prepared by dissolving 67 g. of chromium trioxide in 125 ml. of distilled water. To this solution is added 58 ml. of concentrated sulfuric acid (sp. gr. 1.84), and the salts which precipitate are dissolved by addition of a minimum quantity of distilled water; the total volume of the solution usually does not exceed 225 ml.
One third of this mixture (35 g) is extracted by refluxing in a mixture of 585 mL of absolute ethanol and 15 mL of water in a 1-L flask with good stirring for 45 min. After filtration of the hot suspension, the glycidate crystallizes from the filtered solution to give 12-13 g of product. Another third of the 1 : 1 KBr-potassium glycidate mixture is heated at reflux with stirring in the mother liquors for 45 min. After the second batch of crystalline potassium glycidate is isolated by filtration, the procedure is repeated with the last portion of the KBr-glycidate mixture. The solids collected from the three hot filtrations are combined and extracted a fourth time with the same solution, then crystallized to give additional product. After drying, the total weight of recrystallized potassium glycidate is 47-50 g. This salt contains 9.5-13% of KBr , and the yield is thus 74-80% (corrected for KBr content),.
An oven-dried, 3-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar is charged with 1000 mL of freshly distilled methylene chloride. One of the outer two necks of the flask is equipped with a gas inlet adapter attached to a nitrogen source and the other with a septum connected through a needle to a bubbler. A 125-mL pressure-equalizing addition funnel capped with a septum is placed in the center neck of the flask with the stopcock closed. The funnel is charged with 12.1 mL (150 mmol) of methylene iodide dissolved in 75 mL of distilled methylene chloride . The solution is stirred under nitrogen for 1 hr and the flask is cooled in an ice-water bath. Using a syringe, 15.4 mL (150 mmol) of neat diethylzinc is added to the methylene chloride through the septum. The stopcock of the addition funnel is opened carefully and the methylene iodide solution is allowed to drip into the diethylzinc solution over the course of 30 min. After the reaction is stirred for an additional 10 min, 8.0 mL (50 mmol) of methyl 4,4-dimethyl-3-oxopentanoate is added to the flask over a period of 15 sec through the septum using a syringe. The reaction mixture is stirred for 45 min, the septum is removed, and the reaction is quenched through the careful addition of 125 mL of saturated aqueous ammonium chloride. Stirring is maintained for an additional 10 min, at which time the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-L separatory funnel. The lower organic layer is withdrawn and placed in a large, round-bottomed flask. The methylene chloride is removed using a rotary evaporator and the residue is diluted with 500 mL of diethyl ether and placed in the separatory funnel. It is washed successively with 125-mL portions of saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate , 1 M aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution, deionized water and brine. The aqueous washings are extracted with diethyl ether (3 × 150 mL) and the combined organic layers are dried over 50 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate prior to concentration under reduced pressure. The product is purified by vacuum distillation from anhydrous potassium carbonate (58°C, 1 mm) to give methyl 5,5-dimethyl-4-oxo-hexanoate (7.63-8.09 g, 89-94% yield) as a clear liquid.
B. tert-Butylamine. A hydrogenation bomb or bottle is charged with 100 ml. of purified dioxane,1 35.5 g. (0.5 mole) of freshly distilled 2,2-dimethylethylenimine, and about 9 g. (alcohol-wet weight) of Raney nickel.2 The apparatus is filled with hydrogen, warmed to 60°, and shaken until hydrogenation is complete. The contents of the bomb are removed and filtered to separate the catalyst, which is washed on the funnel with a little dioxane.
B. Reduction of o-chloronitrobenzene. The stirrer is set in position carefully inside the cathode, which is clamped in place at the top. The porous cup, previously impregnated with the electrolyte, is charged with 11.5 g. (0.073 mole) of o-chloronitrobenzene and about 80 ml. of a mixture of acetic acid (70 ml.), concentrated sulfuric acid (22 ml.), and water (8 ml.). The cup is then clamped securely in position, and the beaker containing the anode is supported just clear of the bottom of the porous cup and filled with the same solution of aqueous sulfuric and acetic acids to the same level as the liquid inside the cup. The stirrer is started, the current turned on, and the system observed for a few minutes until the current has become stable. It is then adjusted at some convenient value no greater than 2 amperes.
In a 1-l. three-necked flask having ground-glass joints are placed 500 g. (569 ml., 4.72 moles) of o-xylene, 12 g. of clean iron filings, and a crystal of iodine. The flask is fitted with a dropping funnel, a stirrer, and a condenser; a thermometer is suspended through the condenser on a platinum or Nichrome wire and arranged so that the bulb extends beneath the surface of the liquid. The top of the condenser is connected to a gas-absorption trap. The mixture is stirred and cooled in an ice-salt mixture, preferably under a hood. Six hundred and sixty grams (4.13 moles) of bromine is added drop-wise over a 3-hour period; during this time the internal temperature is maintained at 0° to −5°. After all the bromine has been added the reaction mixture is allowed to stand overnight. It is poured into water and washed successively with a 500-ml. portion of water, two 500-ml. portions of 3% sodium hydroxide solution, and one 500-ml. portion of water. The product is then steam-distilled; about 8 l. of distillate is collected. The organic layer is separated from the water and dried over calcium chloride. The 4-bromo-o-xylene is distilled through a short column under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 92–94°/14–15 mm. (n22D 1.5558) is collected. The yield is 720–745 g. (94–97%, based on bromine).
B. Lactone 5. The crude mixture of rac-3 and rac-4 is dissolved in 300 mL of dry methanol (distilled from sodium) containing 10 drops of concentrated hydrochloric acid and heated under reflux for about 8 hr until the reactants can no longer be detected by thin-layer chromatography. The solvent is removed on a rotary evaporator at 25°C and the remaining residue, which consists of an 8 : 1 mixture of lactone rac-5 and dimethyl ester rac-6, is dissolved in dry dichloromethane (50 mL). The solution is acidified with trifluoroacetic acid (10 mL) and stirred at room temperature for about 48 hr, until the thin-layer chromatogram does not show any dimethyl ester rac-6. The organic layer is washed with water (50 mL), saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (2 × 50 mL), water (50 mL), and brine (50 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated on a rotary evaporator. Distillation of the remaining thick, yellow oil under reduced pressure in a short-path distillation apparatus with an air-cooled condenser gives 12.6 g (79%) of rac-5, bp 133–135°C at 0.001 mm. The colorless oil is dissolved in tert-butyl methyl ether (10 mL) and hexane (80 mL) and the solvent is allowed to evaporate over 2 days to about 15% of the original volume. Lactone rac-5 (8.11 g, 53%) slowly crystallizes (mp 69–71°C) and. If the above procedure is repeated with the mother liquor, a variable additional amount of rac-5 is obtained.
A. (4S)-Isopropyl-3-propionyl-2-oxazolidinone (2). An oven-dried, 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a mechanical stirrer, an internal thermometer, and an adapter equipped with an argon inlet and a rubber septum. The flask is flushed with argon and is charged with 333 mL of dry tetrahydrofuran (THF) and (4S)-isopropyl-2-oxazolidinone (8.61 g, 66.7 mmol). The mixture is cooled to −75 °C in a dry ice-acetone bath. At this temperature, a 2.57 M solution of n-butyllithium in hexane (27.2 mL, 70.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 20 min using a syringe at such a rate that the reaction temperature remains below −72 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 25 min and propionyl chloride (6.29 g, 5.94 mL, 68.0 mmol) is added dropwise over 10 min using a syringe while maintaining an internal temperature below −73 °C. The reaction mixture is stirred at this temperature for 30 min, and the reaction is then quenched with sat. aq. ammonium chloride solution (100 mL). The reaction mixture is transferred to a 1-L separatory funnel and the organic phase is collected. The aqueous phase is extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 100 mL). The combined organic phases are washed with brine (100 mL). Drying with anhydrous sodium sulfate (40 g), filtration, and removal of the solvent under reduced pressure on a rotary evaporator (30 °C, 40 mmHg) afford the crude product as a light yellow oil. The oil is purified by silica gel column chromatography. Fractions containing the product are concentrated by rotary evaporation (30 °C, 40 mmHg) and are dried to yield 11.0 g (89%) of (4S)-isopropyl-3-propionyl-2-oxazolidinone (2) as a colorless oil.
C. 7,8-Dimethoxy-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one. A 250-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, thermometer, and pressure-equalizing dropping funnel. The flask is charged with 32.1 g (100 mmol) of recrystallized N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-7,8-dimethoxy-1,3,4,5-tetrahydro-2H-3-benzazepin-2-one and 100 mL of methylene chloride. The flask is immersed in an ice-water bath and stirred until the internal temperature reaches 5°C. The dropping funnel is charged with 40 mL of trifluoroacetic acid, which is added dropwise at a rate such that the temperature of the reaction mixture does not exceed 10°C. When addition is complete, the cooling bath is removed, and the mixture is stirred for 3 hr.
A solution of phenylmagnesium bromide is prepared in the usual manner1 using 12.2 g. (0.5 gram atom) of magnesium, 78.5 g. (52 ml., 0.5 mole) of bromobenzene, and 500 ml. of absolute ether in a 2-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask fitted with a reflux condenser, a mechanical stirrer, and a dropping funnel. No unreacted magnesium should remain; if any does, an additional 1–2 ml. of bromobenzene should be added.
D. Cyclobutanecarboxaldehyde. A 1-l., round-bottomed flask equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and a 60-cm. glass helix-packed column is charged with 600 ml. of 3 N sulfuric acid, 200 ml. of N,N-dimethylformamide, and 20 g. (0.13 mole) of 2-cyclobutyl-cis-4-trans-5-dimethyl-1,3-dioxolane. The mixture is heated to gentle reflux, and cyclobutanecarboxaldehyde is collected as a steam distillate, b.p. 86°. After the distillation of the oil has ceased, the product is transferred to a separatory funnel, and the lower layer of water is discarded. The oil is dissolved in 25 ml. of ether and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The product is distilled through a small Vigreux column. After removal of the ether, 6.2–6.7 g. (58–63%) of cyclobutanecarboxaldehyde is collected, b.p. 56–59° (120 mm.).
B. Ethyl oxalamidrazonate. A 1-L, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar and fitted with a 125-mL addition funnel. A solution of anhydrous hydrazine (4.8 g, 0.15 mol) in ethanol (75 mL) is added dropwise (10 min) to a stirred solution of ethyl thioamidooxalate (20.0 g, 0.15 mol) in ethanol (450 mL) at 25°C. The reaction mixture is stirred at 25°C (3.0 hr). The solvent is removed under reduced pressure and the reddish-orange solid is triturated with ethanol (350 mL). The ethanolic solution containing the oxalamidrazonate is concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 13.90 g (71%) of ethyl oxalamidrazonate as a yellow solid.
A. 1-Ethoxy-1-(trimethylsilyloxy) cyclopropane. A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is fitted with an efficient mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser provided with a calcium chloride tube, and a 500-mL pressure-equalizing dropping funnel equipped with a nitrogen inlet at the top. The flask is flushed with dry nitrogen, and 500 mL of anhydrous toluene and 52.9 g (2.3 g-atom) of sodium cut in small pieces are introduced. The mixture is brought to reflux by means of a heating mantle and the sodium is finely pulverized by vigorous stirring. Heating and stirring are stopped, and the mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature. Toluene is removed under nitrogen pressure by means of a double-ended needle and replaced by 500 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether and. At this point, 108.5 g (1 mol) of chlorotrimethylsilane is added to the flask. To the mixture, 136.58 g (1 mol) of ethyl 3-chloropropanoate is added dropwise with stirring at a rate sufficient to maintain a gentle reflux over a 3-hr period. When about 0.3 mol of chloro ester has been added, a deep-blue precipitate appears. When the addition is over, the reaction mixture is heated at reflux for 30 min. The contents of the flask are cooled and filtered through a sintered-glass funnel under a stream of dry nitrogen. The precipitate is washed twice with 100 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether.
A mixture of 255 g. (0.75 mole) of ethylene diisothiuronium bromide and 640 g. (9.7 moles) of 85% potassium hydroxide in 1360 ml. of water is placed in a 5-l. round-bottomed three-necked flask and boiled under reflux for 5 hours. Ammonia is evolved during the reflux period. The flask is then equipped with a separatory funnel, a gas-inlet tube, and a condenser set for steam distillation. Nitrogen is admitted through the inlet tube, and a cooled solution of 415 ml. of sulfuric acid in 760 ml. of water is added dropwise. The addition is continued until the reaction mixture becomes acid to Congo red paper, and then a 20% excess of acid is added. Approximately 725–850 ml. of the acid solution is required. The heat of neutralization is sufficient to distil part of the dithiol. At the end of the addition of the acid, the passage of nitrogen is discontinued and steam is admitted through the inlet tube. The steam distillation is continued until about 3 l. of distillate is collected. The oil is separated from the water in the distillate, which is then extracted with two 500-ml. portions of ether. The ether solution and the oil are dried separately over calcium chloride. After evaporation of the solvent, the residue is added to the oil and the crude product is fractionated through a 10-in. Vigreux column under reduced pressure in an atmosphere of nitrogen. The ethanedithiol boils at 63°/46 mm. and weighs 39–44 g. (55–62%); nD20 1.5589.
Two hundred and seventy-six grams (94.3 cc., 1.7 moles) of bromine is now added as rapidly as possible through the dropping funnel, the rate of addition being so controlled that the Friedrichs condenser is continuously about half full of the refluxing liquid. This operation takes about one hour. After about 100 g. of bromine has been added, the dibromosuccinic acid forms rapidly and separates in tiny white needles. At the completion of the reaction there should be a slight excess of bromine, as indicated by the red color of the solution. Occasionally 5–10 g. of bromine has to be added at this point to ensure an excess.
B. Diethyl formylmethylphosphonate. A mixture of 192 g. (0.755 mole) of diethyl 2,2-diethoxyethylphosphonate and 670 ml. of 2% hydrochloric acid is refluxed for 10 minutes under a nitrogen atmosphere. To the cooled (20–30°) mixture is added 240 g. of sodium chloride. The resulting mixture is extracted with three, 500-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic extracts are washed successively with 40 ml. of 5% aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate solution and 300 ml. of saturated aqueous salt solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and distilled under reduced pressure (35 mm.) at water bath temperatures (60–70°). The resulting residue, weighing approximately 125 g., is fractionated under reduced pressure, and the fraction boiling at 100–103° (0.8 mm.) is collected, yielding 104 g. (76%) and.
A 1-L, three-necked, round-bottomed flask is equipped with a magnetic stirring bar, a thermometer, a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel to which an argon inlet is attached, and a condenser fitted with a drying tube filled with potassium hydroxide pellets. The flask is charged with lithium (4.2 g, 0.6 mol,) and 1,3-diaminopropane (300 mL,). The mixture is stirred at room temperature for 30 min. A slight exothermic reaction takes place as the lithium dissolves.
A. (1R,4S)-(−)-4-tert-Butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate. A dry, 500-mL, three-necked, round-bottomed flask, equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, rubber septum, and nitrogen inlet, is purged with nitrogen and charged with 7.67 g (54 mmol) of (1R,4S)-(+)-4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate, 660 mg (5.4 mmol) of 4-dimethylaminopyridine, 17 mL (122 mmol) of triethylamine, and 175 mL of dichloromethane. The reaction mixture is cooled to 0°C in an ice-water bath, and tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (10.24 g, 68 mmol) is introduced in one portion. The ice-water bath is removed and the mixture is allowed to warm to room temperature and stir for 3 hr. At this point, more silyl chloride is added if necessary. After 5 hr, 200 mL of water is added, the mixture is transferred to a separatory funnel and the organic phase separated. The aqueous phase is extracted with three 100-mL portions of dichloromethane. The combined organic layers are washed with 100 mL of saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and 100 mL of brine prior to drying over anhydrous magnesium sulfate. After filtration and solvent removal with a rotary evaporator, the residual solids are removed by filtration, and the resulting yellow oil is purified by bulb-to-bulb distillation at 0.4–0.6 mm (pot temperature 80–100°C) to give 10.67–11.08 g (77–80%) of (1R,4S)-(−)-4-tert-butyldimethylsiloxy-2-cyclopentenyl acetate as a colorless liquid, [α]D20 −1.32° (CH3OH, c 1.52).
A 1-l., three-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser fitted with a potassium hydroxide drying tube, and a pressure-equalizing dropping funnel mounted with a nitrogen-inlet tube is charged with 4.9 g. (0.18 mole) of finely ground sodium cyanide and 500 ml. of dry N,N-dimethylformamide. The flask is immersed in a water bath kept at 35°, stirring is begun, and the apparatus is purged thoroughly with dry nitrogen. After 15 minutes 107.1 g. (1.001 mole) of 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde is added dropwise over a period of 30 minutes. The dark brown solution is stirred for another 30 minutes, after which 39.8 g. (0.751 mole) of freshly distilled acrylonitrile is added over 1 hour. The solution, now red-orange in color and quite viscous, is stirred for 3 hours, 6.6 g. (0.11 mole) of acetic acid is added, and stirring is continued for 5 additional minutes. The solvent is removed with a rotary evaporator, the residue is dissolved in 500 ml. of water, and the solution is extracted continuously with 500 ml. of chloroform for 12 hours. The solvent is evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residual liquid is distilled under reduced pressure through a short-path distillation apparatus. An initial fraction, consisting mainly of 3-pyridinecarboxaldehyde, collects in the cold trap. The product, b.p. 150–152° (0.1 mm.), solidifies in the condenser and is freed by heating the water in the cooling jacket to nearly 100°, yielding 94–101 g. (78–84%) of the light yellow, solid distillate. Recrystallization from 400 ml. of 2-propanol gives 77–82 g. (64–68% based on acrylonitrile) of 4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyronitrile as yellow-tinged, white crystals, m.p. 70–72°.
(B) Tyrosine.—The insoluble material (160–170 g.) obtained on filtering the digestion mixture (p. 612) is suspended in 320 cc. of water and 80 cc. of 36 per cent hydrochloric acid, and the mixture is boiled gently for thirty minutes. After straining through cheesecloth, decolorizing with 6 g. of Norite, and filtering hot, the warm (60–70°) solution is shaken with three 20-cc. portions of benzene and heated to boiling. A slight excess (120–150 cc.) of 28 per cent ammonia is cautiously added, and the mixture is allowed to stand overnight in the icebox. The crystalline product is then filtered and washed with three 40-cc. portions of ice-water. After drying, it weighs about 23 g. The mother liquor and washings are evaporated to about 200 cc., when a second crop is obtained, weighing slightly under 1 g.
During the third hour of heating, the temperature at the top of the column rises slowly as the removal of the water approaches completion. After the fourth hour, when the temperature of the distilling vapor has attained 110–112°, the heating is discontinued, and the reaction mixture is transferred to a 2-l. Claisen flask with the least possible exposure to atmospheric moisture. The unreacted n-butyl alcohol is removed by distillation under reduced pressure until the thermometer registers a sudden rise in temperature. The receiver is then changed, and the main fraction of n-butyl borate distils almost entirely at 103–105°/8 mm. or 114–115°/15 mm. A negligible residue remains in the distilling flask. The weight of the distilled n-butyl borate, which contains a small amount of n-butyl alcohol, is 410–435 g. (89–94 per cent of the theoretical amount). From the aqueous distillate and the fore-run of the vacuum distillation, 190–210 g. of n-butyl alcohol is recovered.
A solution of 20.0 g. (0.105 mole) of p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in 100 ml. of anhydrous ether is injected into the addition funnel and added over a period of 30 minutes to the stirred, red, 0° reaction mixture. The red color immediately disappears upon addition. After addition is complete, 4.2 g. (0.0990 mole) of anhydrous lithium chloride is added. The reaction mixture is warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight (18–20 hours), during which time lithium p-toluenesulfonate precipitates.
Without purification, 8.1 g of the above crude ketal is added to a solution consisting of 1.0 g of oxalic acid, 5 mL of water, and 40 mL of methylene chloride. The resultant mixture is stirred for 5 hr at room temperature. At the end of this period the solution is filtered through 50 g of magnesium sulfate impregnated with 1.0 g of potassium carbonate. Evaporation of the solvent from the filtrate affords a solid which, after purification by short-path distillation (70–80°C, 0.1 mm), gives 4.9 g (46%, based on bromoketal) of pure 2-hydroxymethyl-2-cyclopentenone, mp 68–69°C (off-white crystals) and.
B. Ethyl lithioacetate. The reaction flask is immersed in an acetone–dry-ice bath, and the solution is stirred for 15 minutes to achieve thermal equilibration. After this time, 22.1 g. (0.250 mole) of ethyl acetate is added dropwise over a 10-minute period. Stirring is continued for an additional 15 minutes to complete formation of ethyl lithioacetate.
This material is dissolved in 500 ml. of ethanol and transferred to a 2-l., round-bottomed flask. A solution of 200 g. of sodium hydroxide in 200 ml. of water is added, and the mixtured is refluxed for 2 hours. Ethanol is then removed by distillation, and the residue is shaken with 500 ml. of water and 800 ml. of toluene. The toluene layer is separated, washed with two 200-ml. portions of water, and then vigorously shaken with 600 ml. of 2 N hydrochloric acid. A portion of the 1-benzylisoquinoline hydrochloride precipitates at this point and is collected on a Büchner funnel and washed with 200-ml. portions of water and toluene. The filtrate is then transferred to a separatory funnel, the acidic layer is separated, and the crystals from the Büchner funnel are suspended in this layer. After basifying the suspension with 50% aqueous sodium hydroxide, the oil that separates is extracted with three 200-ml. portions of dichloromethane. The combined dichloromethane layers are dried over anhydrous potassium carbonate, filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure, leaving the crude product as a yellow oil. Distillation under reduced pressure yields 49.8 g. (91%) of pure 1-benzylisoquinoline as a pale yellow oil, b.p. 145–150° (0.01 mm.). The product solidifies on standing and may be crystallized from chloroform–hexane, giving colorless prisms, m.p. 54–55°.
A. Pyridinium polyhydrogen fluoride (1). A tared, 250-ml., polyolefin bottle is equipped with a polyolefin gas-inlet and drying tube inserted through holes in the cap and sealed with Teflon tape. The bottle is charged with 37.5 g. (0.475 mole) of pyridine and cooled in an acetone–dry ice bath. After the pyridine has solidified, 87.5 g. (4.37 moles) of anhydrous hydrogen fluoride is condensed from a cylinder into the bottle through the inlet tube. The amount of hydrogen fluoride is determined by weighing the bottle. After the hydrogen fluoride has cooled, the bottle is cautiously swirled with cooling until the solid dissolves. The solution can now be safely allowed to warm to room temperature.
B. 4-Phenylmorpholine An oven-dried 250-mL, one-necked, round-bottomed flask equipped with a Teflon-coated magnetic stir bar and a septum is maintained under an inert atmosphere of argon and charged with zinc chloride (2.04 g, 15 mmol), and anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (27 mL). The solution is stirred and cooled in an ice-bath. Phenylmagnesium bromide (30 mL, 30 mmol) is added via syringe in one portion. The resulting orange-colored solution is stirred for an additional 30 min in the ice-bath prior to use.
